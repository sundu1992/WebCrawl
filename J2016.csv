Over recent years, the development of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques, together with the emergence of next-generation sequencing, have changed our view of nuclear organization. High-throughput conformation capture techniques have been developed to study the physical interactions of the chromatin fiber with or within genomic regions spanning from a few megabases (5C technique) to a whole-genome scale (4C and Hi-C techniques). In 2009, Eric Lander, Job Dekker and colleagues [1] described the first human chromosomal architecture at a resolution of 1 Mb. Then, four years later, owing to the rapid evolution of sequencing capabilities, Bing Ren and colleagues [2] published a high-resolution map of the ‘chromatin interactome’ in human fibroblasts at a resolution of 5 to 10 kb., The picture that emerges from this blossoming area of research is that metazoan chromosomes are characterized by a nested hierarchy of structural layers (Figure 1, left panel). Within each chromosome territory, compartments originally termed ‘A’ and ‘B’, each of several megabases, tend to associate within each single chromosome, reflecting the preferential colocalization of active, gene-rich regions and their segregation from gene-poor, inactive regions [1]. More recently, a further sub-megabase scale of genome partitioning into topologically associating domains (TADs) has been reported [3–5]. Sequences within TADs tend to interact more frequently than with any other surrounding region of the genome. These domains, spanning a few hundred kilobases, are stable across different cell types, suggesting that they are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Furthermore, within TADs, a network of cell-type-specific physical interactions between potential regulatory sequences has been shown to take place [6]. Consistent with this, a recent study using high-resolution Hi-C showed that enhancer-promoter contacts almost always occur within TADs [2].

                        Cell-cycle dependence of chromosome structure. Left: high-resolution chromosome-conformation capture technologies have revealed that each mammalian chromosome territory can be decomposed into multi-megabase compartments where preferential interactions occur between active gene-rich and inactive gene-poor regions of the chromosome. Compartments can be further partitioned at the submegabase scale into topological associating domains (TADs) spanning a few hundred kilobases each. Dekker and colleagues [7] show that compartments and TADs are stable across the cell cycle from G1 to late S phase. Right: in metaphase, the compartment and TAD structures disappear and are replaced by a cylindrically condensed structure of linearly arranged short-range loops [7], which occur on a shorter genomic scale (80 kb on average) than TADs. It is hypothesized that the persistence of bookmarking factors on the mitotic chromosome might facilitate the rapid re-emergence of compartments and TADs upon exit of the cells from mitosis.
                    , Despite the pace at which new details of mammalian chromosome organization are accumulating, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. For example, what is the cell-to-cell variability in the structures that give rise to compartments, TADs and promoter-enhancer interactions? How important is each of those structural layers for the regulation of transcription? What are the molecular mechanisms that determine the appearance of TADs and compartments? When are these layers established during development? Are these different levels of chromosome organization present throughout the cell cycle, or are they established at a particular phase? Finally, what is the structure of mitotic chromosomes? Are the hierarchical layers of folding maintained during mitosis, or do chromosomes acquire a different organization, as suggested by light and electron microscopy? A recent exciting study has shed light on these last questions [7]., Although DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled to super-resolution microscopy has previously been used in murine cells to investigate the presence of TADs within the X-inactivation center during the cell cycle from G1/S phase to mitotic prophase [4], a detailed molecular analysis of chromatin interactions throughout the cell cycle had not, until recently, been reported. Dekker and colleagues [7] now report the results of performing carbon-copy chromosome conformation capture (5C) and Hi-C experiments in synchronized human HeLa cells at different phases of the cell cycle. Using 5C technology spanning the whole of chromosome 21 at a resolution of 250 kb, the authors first studied the long-range chromatin interactions of early G1-, mid-G1-, S- and M-phase cells. Interaction maps of these different stages showed that the mitotic interaction pattern differs dramatically from that at all other stages, thus revealing two distinct chromosome folding states during the cell cycle. Using Hi-C (at a resolution of 40 kb) on mitotic and mid-G1-stage cells [7], the investigators further found that both compartments [1] and TADs [3, 4] appear to be absent throughout the entire genome in metaphase, becoming detectable only in early G1 phase and remaining unchanged throughout interphase. These observations on mitotic chromosomes were repeated and validated in another cell line and in primary human fibroblasts. Importantly, the authors showed that, apart from metaphase, compartments and TADs are not restricted to any specific cell cycle phase and they are easily detected in early G1, thus ruling out the possibility that the patterns observed in 5C or Hi-C could be due to a superposition of alternative cell-cycle phase-specific conformations., The finding that TADs and compartments apparently disappear during metaphase, and reappear in early G1, raises the questions of why they are lost and also what mechanism ensures their prompt re-establishment upon exit from mitosis. It is known that certain transcription factors and histone modifications or associated factors can act as ‘bookmarking’ factors on mitotic chromosomes [8] by remaining bound to the condensed chromatin polymer in order to ensure the propagation of transcriptional states to daughter cells. It is therefore tempting to speculate that structural bookmarking factors that propagate organizational information to daughter cells might similarly exist. Although the molecular bases of compartments and TADs remain elusive, accumulating evidence suggests that long-range interactions between genomic sites bound by the proteins CTCF and cohesin contribute to the organization of chromatin architecture at the TAD scale, either by associating with TAD boundaries [3] or by supervising a network of long-range interactions inside single TADs that might stabilize the structure within TADs [6]. Interestingly, both CTCF and cohesin have been shown to associate with mitotic chromosomes [8], suggesting that mutual interactions between CTCF and/or cohesin binding sites might readily occur upon exit from mitosis, thus enabling TADs to be established immediately at the beginning of G1 phase. Other factors that might remain bound during mitosis to the positions of TAD or compartment boundaries include Polycomb group proteins, which have been shown to significantly overlap with TAD boundaries [5] on mitotic chromosomes in Drosophila[9], The apparent loss of partitioning into TADs and compartments observed in mitotic chromosomes by Dekker and colleagues [7] suggests that they contain unusually few structural details compared with those of their interphase counterparts. However, the authors cleverly exploited the quantitative information present in the Hi-C mitotic chromosome data to build a structural model. The foundation of their approach is that Hi-C or 5C interaction maps represent the frequency at which every pair of genomic loci along the chromatin polymer encounter each other, averaged over millions of cells. It is therefore possible to use models from polymer physics to simulate virtual Hi-C (or 5C) data and compare them with data from experiments. Using such an approach, the thermodynamic ensemble of configurations of a model chromosome can be generated by computer simulations, and a contact map is retrieved by averaging the contacts of each pair of loci over all simulated polymer conformations, allowing a straightforward comparison with experimental data., In the case of mitotic chromosome data, the Hi-C or 5C contact maps are homogeneous, with no sign of the regular patterning due to TADs and compartments that characterize the interphase contact maps [7]. Dekker and colleagues also noted that the contact probability between two loci gradually decreases with increasing genomic distance (albeit significantly more slowly than on interphase chromosomes), and then suddenly falls off to zero at approximately 10 Mb. This unusual behavior cannot be explained by any simple polymer models. Building on the well-established experimental evidence describing the quantitative properties of mitotic chromosomes (such as cylindrical symmetry, linear organization of chromatids and chromatin packing density), the authors thus set out to build various alternative models for the chromatin organization within mitotic chromosomes, simulated all of them and tested each model’s predictions. In order to reproduce the unexpected fall-off in contact probabilities for loci that are separated by >10 Mb, they had to impose that the chromatin fiber is linearly organized, so that genomic loci belonging to distal parts of the chromosome (that is, separated by >10 Mb) cannot be brought into close spatial proximity. Furthermore, they had to impose that the chromatin fiber is arranged in an array of consecutive loops, each spanning approximately 80 kb, in order for their simulations to account correctly for the gentle decrease in contact frequencies in the genomic length range between 0 and 10 Mb. Thus, amongst all possible models tested, it was this combination of linear organization and consecutive looping that best accounted for the behavior of the contact probability of mitotic chromosomes over all genomic length scales. Interestingly, the authors further discovered that they could simultaneously reproduce the scaling of contact probabilities and the homogeneity of the mitotic contact maps only when they allowed the size of the loops to be different (and stochastic) in each of the polymer configurations., The study by Dekker and colleagues represents a powerful combination of biochemical investigation and polymer modeling [7]. The prowess of such an approach is that it can provide insights into structure that would not have been obtained without modeling. The picture that emerges, thanks to their study, is that of a mitotic chromosome composed of consecutive loops of chromatin, the size of which is on average 80 kb, although this varies from cell to cell, which are arranged in a linear fashion eventually resulting in an effective cylindrical chromosomal volume (Figure 1, right panel). This picture is both qualitatively and quantitatively in agreement with previously proposed ‘loops-on-a-scaffold’ models of mitotic chromosomes based on microscopy and biochemical assays., Although the molecular mechanisms that could mediate this pervasive local looping remain elusive, the model predicts that cell-to-cell variability of looping events has a sizeable effect in organizing the structure of mitotic chromatin. Indeed, the potential importance of fluctuations in interphase chromosome structure was also recently revealed by an adaptation of the Hi-C technique to single cells [10]. In the future, this type of single-cell approach, together with physical modeling and quantitative analysis, could allow the exploration of chromosome structure in situations where cell-to-cell variability might be crucial, such as during early development."
"5","Performance of genomic medicine","Konrad J Karczewski, Stephen B Montgomery","Biomedical Informatics Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine","Konrad J Karczewski, Stephen B Montgomery","konradjkarczewski@gmail.com, smontgom@stanford.edu","23 December 2013","","","A report on the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory meeting on Precision Medicine: Personal Genomes and Pharmacogenomics, held in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA, November 13–16, 2013., This year truly marked the beginning of full-scale integration of genomics into routine medical practice at a number of institutions. Now that some basic frameworks are in place for generating and returning results, the next step in genomic medicine lies in evaluating how well these models are working. Leslie Biesecker (National Human Genome Research Institute, USA) discussed his success rates from two perspectives. First, in a phenotype-centric view, adopting very high thresholds for variants for cardiomyopathy, he was able to achieve a 100% positive predictive value, suggesting that the pathogenicity criteria are too stringent, resulting in high specificity, but low sensitivity. Alternatively, from a genome-centric view, in 870 exomes primarily unselected for disease, he found 32 variants that were predicted to produce a phenotype. In many cases, after extensive follow-up, patients were found to have phenotypes similar to the prediction, and Biesecker surmised that it was likely that close to 5 to 10% of people have an undiagnosed Mendelian trait. He went on to discuss an incidental finding in a BRCA1 mutation in a man obtaining a clinical genome for heart disease: on the basis of this information, genetic testing was recommended to the man’s sister, who later underwent a laparoscopy to detect fallopian cancer and, after treatment, is now disease free. He urged the audience to ‘not be afraid of genomics and preventative medicine’ and claimed that genomics is already saving lives., At this meeting, multiple institutions offered up their overall success rate for diagnosing Mendelian disorders, all of which were in the 25 to 50% range. As Debbie Nickerson (University of Washington, USA) and others noted, this rate depends on a number of factors, including mode of inheritance, the number of samples available, heterogeneity and knowledge of the phenotype. However, while the ideal success rate would be 100%, she noted that even in mouse models, only approximately 60% of cases are solved, and so the statistics are better than one might expect. Additionally, indels and large structural variants are crucial in disease and often missed: as methods for detecting these improve, so should the success rate. Liz Worthey (Medical College of Wisconsin, USA) presented her group’s initial successful diagnosis rate of approximately 22%, but after re-analysis 18 months later, this number increased to 39% and even 65% when including variants of unknown significance. She noted that these numbers are probably underestimates, as the initial cases sent for genome sequencing were already those that were notoriously difficult to solve., Matthew Hurles (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), speaking for the Deciphering Developmental Disorders project in the UK, mirrored these sentiments, and provided a detailed breakdown of diagnostic yield for de novo variants among candidate genes for developmental disorders, which, in addition to single nucleotide variants, also included copy number variants, some of which would not have been previously detected by a clinical microarray. Additionally interesting at this meeting was the increasing support for data sharing to enable disease gene discovery. While the issue of genomic data release is a delicate one, Hurles presented the DECIPHER (Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources) consortium’s experiences with meeting these challenges to enable sharing of genotypes and phenotypes across the globe. Tim Hubbard (King’s College London, UK, and Genomics England, UK) explained a different approach to be used for the 100 K Genome Project, in which data will be stored behind a firewall at the National Health Service (NHS), but researchers can submit a virtual machine to perform their analyses on the dataset. Nickerson also described their efforts to enable data sharing and patient recruitment to enlarge the sample sizes needed for discovery efforts as part of the Centers for Mendelian Genomics., From the pharmacogenomics angle, Catherine Brownstein (Boston Children’s Hospital, USA) presented their pilot program for pharmacogenetic screening, starting with thiopurine methyltransferase and thiopurines, and integration into the electronic medical record (EMR). She estimated these efforts have already saved many patients from overdosing and saved US$71,000 for the hospital for this one drug-gene pair, but also noted there is work to do yet: their current EMRs will not handle the sheer volume of data from a VCF file, and so new challenges are emerging to store these genomic data in the clinic. Brownstein noted that in their clinic, the practitioners have already seen an average of about 2.6 pharmacogenomic clinical decision support alerts. Mary Relling (St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, USA) described the PG4KDS pilot program at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital, which includes testing for four genes, with results directly integrated into the EMR. She provided an encouraging view on the adoption of these tests, as the program is at nearly 100% patient compliance, and there does not seem to be evidence of physician alert-fatigue., Throughout the meeting it was evident that there remain multiple challenges to more routine integration of genomics in a clinical setting. While speakers highlighted outcomes in focused areas of application, it was no surprise that these remained a step away from routinely adding each patient’s genome to their EMR. While cost/benefit discussions largely factor into why this remains the case, there was also ample discussion as to the desires of patients and doctors when confronted with genomic data. The session on ethics specifically discussed perspectives on the return of secondary results. Robert Green (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, USA) shared findings from the REVEAL (Risk Evaluation and Education for Alzheimer’s Disease) study that individuals who learn their genetic susceptibilities do not exhibit clinically significant distress. Furthermore, those that learned that they carry risk alleles for two diseases, Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular disease, were less worried than individuals who learned they had risk alleles for just one. Concerns about whether this information was causing excessive new challenges for primary care providers (PCPs) or a new burden of unnecessary supplemental testing remain the subject of future focus where all speakers in this session reported ongoing research studies of PCPs to determine the challenges being faced. Green further indicated that this may not be negligible, as up to 28% of patients indicated they would discuss their results with their PCP. Overall, the ethics session speakers were positive, noting an increase in use of genetic testing for specific applications and medical conditions, along with greater understanding among patients and doctors of its limitations., Across all sessions it was maintained that healthcare systems and genetic researchers will be facing an ever-increasing deluge of genomic data. Organizing and interpreting this flood of data will further require diverse partnerships that span government, academia and industry. In this regard, Tim Hubbard discussed the efforts of Genomics England and the NHS to initiate competition among genomic service providers for the sequencing and interpretation of 100,000 human whole genomes. The benefits of the proposed activity will provide a common, competitive infrastructure for analyzing genomes and health data en masse. Such volumes of genome sequencing data will not be alone, as the Saudi Arabia national science agency has recently proposed to sequence the same number of individuals. In fact, Richard Durbin (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) indicated in his plenary talk that the future will require increasing innovation in managing and interpreting large genomics data sets and that by 2020 we can expect to see millions of human genomes sequenced. He further stressed that with these data, we can begin to think about the saturation of genetic information in humans, where all important and non-lethal mutations will be observed in numerous individuals worldwide, a question they are beginning to address with the British Population Autozygosity Gene Function Study. This highlights that methods facilitating the analysis of genomic information across heterogeneous health management settings will be of considerable importance to accelerating the clinical utilization of genomic data in the near future., Future advances in genomic medicine focused on the ongoing innovation in genomic technology. Among the advances presented during the meeting were novel strategies for next generation sequencing variant calling pipelines for clinical applications (Francisco de la Vega, Real Time Genomics, USA), the development of longer read technologies using PacBio sequencing for examination of structural variation (Mark Wang, Baylor College of Medicine, USA) and approaches to incorporate diverse functional genomics data (Ekta Khurana, Yale University, USA). With all of these tools available, the immediate future of genomic medicine will most likely remain focused on tiered sequencing strategies for focused applications."

This mutualism arose approximately 75 million years ago. Unlike many other intimate symbioses, which involve vertical transmission of symbionts to host offspring, female fig wasps fly great distances to transfer horizontally between hosts. In contrast, male wasps are wingless and cannot disperse. Symbionts that keep intimate contact with their hosts often show genome reduction, but it is not clear if the wide dispersal of female fig wasps will counteract this general tendency. We sequenced the genome of the fig wasp Ceratosolen solmsi to address this question., The genome size of the fig wasp C. solmsi is typical of insects, but has undergone dramatic reductions of gene families involved in environmental sensing and detoxification. The streamlined chemosensory ability reflects the overwhelming importance of females finding trees of their only host species, Ficus hispida, during their fleeting adult lives. Despite long-distance dispersal, little need exists for detoxification or environmental protection because fig wasps spend nearly all of their lives inside a largely benign host. Analyses of transcriptomes in females and males at four key life stages reveal that the extreme anatomical sexual dimorphism of fig wasps may result from a strong bias in sex-differential gene expression., Our comparison of the C. solmsi genome with other insects provides new insights into the evolution of obligate mutualism. The draft genome of the fig wasp, and transcriptomic comparisons between both sexes at four different life stages, provide insights into the molecular basis for the extreme anatomical sexual dimorphism of this species.","","In symbiosis, different species live together intimately. Symbiosis is responsible for several major transitions in evolution, including the origin of eukaryotes, and it underpins key ecosystem functions like nitrogen fixation and pollination [1]. In this system, a large species (host) usually interacts with a smaller one (symbiont), which may live inside it as an ‘endosymbiont’. Interactions can be antagonistic, when the symbiont harms the host, such as for parasites and most plant-herbivore interactions [2], or mutualistic, where host and symbiont both benefit from the association and their evolutionary interests are more closely aligned [1, 3]. Obligate herbivore-plant mutualisms are relatively uncommon, but the fig pollinating wasp-fig mutualism is an ancient and stable association that originated about 75 million years ago [4]., Typically, endosymbionts are host-specific and show specialized adaptations to life inside their hosts [5, 6]. For example, parasites often exhibit a series of morphological reductions. Symbionts may also tend towards gene loss and genome reduction [7]. For example, parasites like tapeworms [8] and the mutualistic bacterium Buchnera[9, 10] have smaller genomes than their free-living relatives. Many endosymbionts spend most or all of their lives in the host [5, 6] and are vertically transmitted from one host generation to the next, often through eggs or propagules [9–11]. Even when an endosymbiont has a free-living stage, it is often quiescent (for example, tapeworm eggs); transmission to other hosts occurs via host contact or through food or water. Consequently, most obligate endosymbionts, benign or parasitic, live most of their lives in somewhat simplified, relatively predictable environments, allowing selective reduction of their anatomies and genomes [5, 6]., Fig-pollinating wasps (Agaonidae: Hymenoptera), hereafter referred to as ‘fig wasps’ or ‘fig pollinators’ for brevity, have an obligate, pollinating mutualism with fig trees (Ficus: Moracae) [12, 13]. Therefore, unlike most other insect herbivores (for example, Tribolium beetles, pea aphids, diamondback moths), fig wasps are highly mutualistic with the plants upon which they feed. This is one of the most dramatic and ancient examples of an obligatory herbivore-plant mutualism known. Males spend their entire lives inside figs, but females have a brief (1 to 2 day) free-living adult stage that is crucial because these tiny wasps (2 to 5 mm long) achieve record feats of dispersal to lay eggs in trees up to 160 km away [14, 15] (Figure 1). Selection on males favors anatomical and genomic reductions, but selection on females may oppose this. The need of female fig wasps to disperse great distances and precisely locate and enter host figs requires impressive environmental sensing and locomotor abilities. Thus, sex-differential selection results in extreme anatomical sexual dimorphism (Figure 2). Female fig wasps resemble other related wasps, although their narrow heads and detachable antennae are key adaptations for entering figs. In contrast, being wingless, de-pigmented, having reduced antennae and eyes [12, 13], males show a series of morphological reductions befitting obligate endosymbionts.

                    , 
                Ceratosolen solmsi is the obligate pollinating wasp of Ficus hispida, and it has the lifestyle and morphological characters typical of fig pollinators (Figures 1 and 2). We investigate how the longstanding mutualism and largely endosymbiotic lifestyle have shaped the genome of this herbivorous insect by deciphering the draft genome, as well as exploring life-staged transcriptomic differences between both sexes. We also test whether this largely endosymbiotic lifestyle has led to the endosymbiont signature of genome reduction, or if a life cycle with dispersive females prevents this from happening. In the latter case, we predict that male morphological reduction largely reflects reduced gene expression. This draft genome provides a valuable new genome resource for hymenopteran insects, and also permits comparisons with other insects to shed new light on the evolution of obligate mutualism., The fig-fig wasp system is one of the most dramatic and ancient examples of an obligatory herbivore-plant mutualism known. Both figs and fig wasps show morphologies highly specialized to this mutualism. The first draft genome sequence of a fig wasp, that of C. solmsi, reveals how the long-term mutualism has shaped its genome. The genome generally resembles that of other insects in that it has similar gene content to other hymenopterans and other insects in genes such as those encoding for heat shock proteins, circadian rhythm, yellow and royal jelly-like proteins, hox complex, sex determination, and DNA methylation (for further information on these analyses plus an interesting analysis on the nutritional and microbial in the genome, please see Additional file 1). However, importantly, the fig wasp genome shows marked reductions of genes associated with environmental sensing and protection (for example, detoxification). Extreme host-specificity and endosymbiosis in a mutualistic host appears to drive this pattern. Counter-intuitively, complex dispersal is viable with a streamlined chemosensory toolbox, maybe because overwhelming selection pressure involves homing in on the correct host during the short adult lives of females; the sensing of other aspects of a complex external environment is of little importance, and might even be distracting. Comparisons of transcriptomes between female and male fig wasps at the key life stages of larva, early pupa, late pupa, and adult indicate that extreme anatomical sexual dimorphism likely results from a strong bias in sex-specific gene expression. Our analyses facilitate a deeper understanding of the biology of fig wasps, and also provide new insights into the evolution and genomic adaptations of mutualisms."

Successful pathogens deliver virulence proteins, termed effectors, into the plant cell where they can interfere with the immune response and promote disease. Engineering the plant immune system to enhance disease resistance requires a thorough understanding of its components., We describe a high-throughput screen, using RNA sequencing and virus-induced gene silencing, to identify tomato genes whose expression is enhanced by the flagellin microbe-associated molecular pattern flgII-28, but reduced by activities of the Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) type III effectors AvrPto and AvrPtoB. Gene ontology terms for this category of Flagellin-induced repressed by effectors (FIRE) genes showed enrichment for genes encoding certain subfamilies of protein kinases and transcription factors. At least 25 of the FIRE genes have been implicated previously in plant immunity. Of the 92 protein kinase-encoding FIRE genes, 33 were subjected to virus-induced gene silencing and their involvement in pattern-triggered immunity was tested with a leaf-based assay. Silencing of one FIRE gene, which encodes the cell wall-associated kinase SlWAK1, compromised the plant immune response resulting in increased growth of Pst and enhanced disease symptoms., Our transcriptomic approach identifies FIRE genes that represent a pathogen-defined core set of immune-related genes. The analysis of this set of candidate genes led to the discovery of a cell wall-associated kinase that participates in plant defense. The FIRE genes will be useful for further elucidation of the plant immune system.","","The plant immune system involves two related inducible responses. The first response is activated by the detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by the extracellular domains of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 
[1]. A small number of PRRs have been identified in plants that recognize MAMPs derived from flagellin, elongation factor Tu, an ethylene-inducing xylanase, and certain non-proteinaceous MAMPs 
[2]. Additionally, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which typically appear in the apoplast as a consequence of pathogen attack, function as host-derived elicitors 
[3]. The activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) by MAMPs and DAMPs leads to changes in the intracellular calcium concentration, production of reactive oxygen species, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and transcriptional reprogramming 
[4]. These events lead, in a largely unknown manner, to inhibition of pathogen growth and suppression of disease. Successful pathogens deliver virulence proteins (effectors) into the plant cell and a majority of these proteins appear to function by interfering with host immunity-associated events triggered by MAMP recognition 
[5]. A second plant defense response, effector-triggered immunity (ETI), can be activated in cases where a specific pathogen effector or its activity is recognized by a host nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing (NB-LRR) resistance protein 
[1]., The interaction of tomato with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) is a powerful model system for understanding the molecular basis of bacterial pathogenesis and plant immunity 
[6]. Pst enters the apoplastic space of tomato leaves through stomata or wound sites. The plant responds to Pst even at the stomatal entry stage, although the bacterium can overcome this response with the aid of the phytotoxin coronatine 
[7]. Pst present in the apoplast is detected by PRR-mediated recognition of various MAMPs thereby activating PTI. The best characterized of these MAMPs is a 22-amino acid region of flagellin (flg22), which is recognized by FLS2, a PRR with extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an intracellular protein kinase domain 
[8]. The mechanism by which FLS2 activates intracellular events involves another LRR receptor-like kinase, BAK1, as well as cytoplasmic protein kinases of the PBS1-like family 
[9–11]. Recently, another MAMP derived from flagellin, flgII-28, has been identified 
[12]. The PRR that detects flgII-28 is unknown, but it appears to play an important role in activating PTI in solanaceous species 
[13]., Two Pst effector proteins, AvrPto and AvrPtoB, have been studied extensively and found to play multiple important roles during the tomato–Pst interaction 
[14]. These roles are partially redundant and deletion of both effector genes is required before a marked decrease in virulence is observed. Some of this redundancy is attributable to the fact that each effector binds and interferes with protein kinase domains of the FLS2–BAK1 complex, thereby disrupting the host response to flg22 
[14]. However, each effector targets additional host proteins using independent domains found in each effector 
[15, 16]. In a well-studied example of ETI, the host protein kinases Fen and Pto appear to act as decoys of the real kinase virulence targets. Interaction of AvrPto and AvrPtoB with these decoys triggers a host immune response mediated through the NB-LRR protein Prf 
[17]., Host responses associated with PTI and ETI are complex and have been studied by both reductionist approaches focused on individual components and mechanisms as well as by large-scale systems biology approaches looking at the totality of metabolomic, proteomic and transcriptomic changes. Previous transcriptomic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato and other species have relied primarily on microarrays and cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methods, which, though limited in their dynamic range and, in some cases, in their genome coverage, have yielded important insights into PTI, ETI and the role of pathogen effectors in suppressing the former responses 
[18–25]. However, the emergence of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and associated statistical analyses as well as the availability of improved gene annotation now allows for the development of a much more comprehensive view of subtle gene expression changes, and how pathogen effectors impact these changes as part of their immunity-suppressive activities. Here we have taken advantage of the recently completed tomato genome sequence 
[26], the comprehensive nature of RNA-seq analysis, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and the well-characterized tomato–Pst system to develop a genome-wide screen for genes whose expression is specifically altered in response to both MAMP detection and subsequent activities of pathogen effectors., We observed that about 13% of the genes expressed in leaves under our conditions were induced 6 h after exposure to a single flagellin-derived MAMP. We hypothesized that Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) has evolved to interfere with many of the most important PTI-induced genes and so further focused on those genes whose expression is suppressed by two pathogen effector proteins, AvrPto and AvrPtoB. These effectors target PRR complexes as part of their virulence activity and are expected to compromise a large portion of the PTI response emanating from subsequent signaling events 
[14]. Of the 2,268 flgII-28-induced genes, 27% were present in this flagellin-induced, repressed by effector (FIRE) class. At least 25 FIRE genes have been previously implicated in the plant immune response including Bti9 (Solyc02g079600), FLS2 (Solyc02g070890 and Solyc02g070910), RIN4 (Solyc09g059430 and Solyc06g083390), HvCRK1 (Solyc03g111540) and LCERK-VI.2 (Solyc09g005000) (Additional file 
5: Table S2). From an initial screen of 33 protein kinase-encoding FIRE genes, we identified SlWAK1, a gene that, when silenced, compromised the host immune response to Pst infection to a similar degree as that observed in FLS2-silenced plants. Together, the collection of 622 FIRE genes provides a new resource for functional genomics screens in solanaceous plants and for comparative transcriptomics of PTI and ETI responses induced by specific MAMPs and DAMPs and diverse pathogens., Plants recognize several bacterial MAMPs including flg22, EF-Tu, csp22, peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides, although the importance of each of these in any particular plant species varies 
[4]. Recently, a new flagellin-derived MAMP, flgII-28, has been discovered that is recognized by tomato and other solanaceous plants but not by Arabidopsis[12]. The possibility that FLS2 might be involved in flgII-28 recognition has been excluded and its receptor remains unknown 
[13]. Here we used flgII-28 to elicit PTI in tomato leaves and found that it induces large transcriptional changes similar to host responses to other MAMPs. These changes largely overlap with those observed when the FliC protein is used to elicit PTI as shown by comparisons of wild-type and flagellin-deficient bacteria. Together, our RNA-seq experiments indicate that flagellin-derived MAMPs (flg22 and/or flgII-28) are by the far the major bacterial MAMP recognized by tomato 6 h post inoculation. We cannot exclude the possibility that other MAMPs play an important role at other time points, in specific plant tissues or at certain stages of pathogen attack. For example, we have reported that the Bti9 kinase (the AtCERK1 ortholog in tomato) likely detects a flagellin-independent MAMP and makes an important contribution to Pst resistance, especially in the lower leaves of tomato 
[16]. It also has been discovered that in Arabidopsis seedlings the transcriptional response to oligogalacturonides (OGs) and flg22 greatly overlaps 1 h after exposure, but at 3 h the flg22 transcriptional response is still high while the response to OGs is diminished, suggesting that transcriptional reprogramming due to perception of these two elicitors changes over time 
[23]. Further experiments with additional MAMPs and at multiple time points will be needed to understand better possible temporal effects on the host response to bacterial elicitors., The central importance of flagellin detection in the activation of the PTI response in tomato makes it a vulnerable target for bacterial pathogens. Currently, five Pst effectors are known to undermine the FLS2-BAK1 pathway (AvrPto, AvrPtoB, AvrPphB, HopAI1 and HopF2) 
[6]. Examination of a ‘minimal repertoire’ of type III effectors needed to confer full virulence to Pst strain DC3000 revealed that AvrPto and AvrPtoB are ‘early acting’ effectors whose activity allows for the manipulation by later acting effectors of other host defenses such as vesicle trafficking 
[5]. This early activity is due to the fact that AvrPto and AvrPtoB each have a domain that binds and inhibits the kinase domains of proteins in the FLS2/BAK1 complex 
[14]. Our finding that about 30% of the genes induced by flgII-28 are suppressed by AvrPto and/or AvrPtoB suggests they may also disrupt the flgII-28 receptor complex. Each of these effectors also has other domains with virulence-promoting activities 
[15, 16, 33–35]. Whether these domains affect host gene expression is unknown, but our present RNA-seq data suggest that transcriptomics combined with point mutations in each effector, which affect the virulence determinants independently, could help elucidate the contributions of each domain., Our initial VIGS screen of 33 kinase-encoding FIRE genes identified a plant cell wall-associated kinase (SlWAK1) that plays an important role in resistance to infection by Pst. WAK genes were first identified in Arabidopsis where they occur as a clustered five-member gene family along with 21 other ‘WAK-like kinases’ (WAKL) elsewhere in the genome 
[31, 36, 37]. WAK and most WAKL proteins contain a cytoplasmic kinase domain, a transmembrane domain and extracellular epidermal growth factor motifs 
[37]. These proteins have been implicated previously in host responses to pathogen attack and particularly in the perception of pectin-derived fragments 
[31]. WAKLs were found to be highly represented among the kinases induced by MAMPs in Arabidopsis although no specific gene was shown to contribute to the immune response 
[22]. In fact, a clear demonstration of the role of WAKs in host defense by loss-of-function analyses has been hindered by lethality or developmental defects of some WAK mutants and possibly redundancy, which is not easily addressed by a mutational approach, due to the tight linkage of the five WAK genes in Arabidopsis[38]. As a result, the best evidence to date that WAKs play a role in immunity comes from indirect approaches. For example, overexpression of chimeric receptors using domains of WAK1 and EFR revealed that WAK1 is a receptor for OGs and can contribute to resistance to Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Botrytis cinerea[39]. In another study, a dominant allele of WAK2, which was created by fusing it to an artificial epitope tag, induced various defense-associated responses that were suppressed by a mpk6 mutation 
[40]. In addition, certain WAKLs have been implicated in resistance to fungal pathogens 
[41, 42] and recently AtWAKL10 was reported to be expressed coordinately with defense-related genes 
[43]., In our case, silencing reduced the transcript abundance of three closely-related WAK genes in N. benthamiana by 45% to 65% and resulted in severely compromised PTI and enhanced susceptibility to Pst infection. There are seven predicted WAK genes in tomato and four of them occur in a clustered gene family that includes SlWAK1. Unlike genes belonging to the WAK family in Arabidopsis[23], SlWAK1 gene expression is induced during the response to MAMPs. Extensive sequence divergence prevented the assignment of orthologous relations between the tomato WAK genes and those in Arabidopsis. Consequently, we designated our gene as SlWAK1, since it appears to be the first WAK gene to be described in tomato. The previously reported LeWAK (Solyc02g090110) 
[44], is actually a WAKL and is most closely related to Arabidopsis WAKL14 (AT2G23450) and WAKL21 (AT5G66790) (Figure 
6). LeWAK is also a FIRE gene and we silenced it along with two other FIRE WAK/L genes but observed no effect on PTI., Based on previous work with Arabidopsis, it is possible that SlWAK1 acts as a DAMP receptor by playing a role in recognition of OGs and subsequent signal transduction. OGs could be generated from enzymatic activity encoded by either the pathogen or the host 
[45]. For example, DC3000 has both a pectin lyase (PL) and a polygalacturonase (PG), which could generate OGs during the infection process 
[46]. In addition, tomato has a PG gene that was shown to be induced in leaves by damage (Solyc08g060970) and, interestingly, this is a FIRE gene. Another FIRE gene, Solyc05g005570, is closely related to a gene encoding a PG beta subunit that modulates PG activity (Solyc05g005560). Inhibitors of PG activity have been implicated in contributing to the formation of pectin fragments that function as DAMPs 
[3, 45]. A gene encoding one of these inhibitors is induced by flagellin, but is not a FIRE gene (Solyc07g065090). Collectively, our observations support a model in which tomato recognition of MAMPs leads to increased expression of SlWAK1 and an increase in SlWAK1 receptors at the plasma membrane. Subsequently, OGs are generated by pathogen- and/or host-encoded enzymes and are recognized as DAMPs by SlWAK1, triggering a sustained immune response. Further experiments are needed to test this model, such as assaying whether SlWAK1 participates in OG perception, developing and testing DC3000 mutants that lack the PL and/or PG genes, and examining the effect of silencing the host PG and PG beta subunit genes., Forward and reverse genetic screens for genes that act downstream of MAMP recognition have identified relatively few genes 
[2, 29]. Instead, downstream components have mostly been discovered by biochemical (BAK1) or transcriptomic (BIK1) approaches 
[47, 48]. This apparent shortcoming of genetic screens may be due to functional redundancy of specific genes or of PTI-induced pathways. It is also possible that, as with BAK1, many PTI-related genes play an important role in development or other fundamental processes and these genes might be missed by forward genetic screens. Here, we excluded from our VIGS screen those genes that have already been shown to be involved in immunity (25 out of 622). The fact that just one gene in the first 33 tested genes had a compromised immune response might indicate that relatively few PTI-induced genes play a critical role in immunity. Alternatively, this low frequency could be due to the use of heterologous fragments for VIGS silencing, limitations of the one PTI assay we used or redundancy in gene function. Consistent with the last possibility, multiple calcium-dependent protein kinases had to be knocked out to observe their involvement in immunity 
[49]. An initial challenge for such combinatorial genetic approaches to functional testing of redundant factors is the identification of a set of candidate genes that is small enough to be manageable and sufficiently documented to justify the effort. The FIRE genes we have identified here meet these criteria. Furthermore, our transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses of FIRE genes suggest that tomato defense against Pst is dominated by perception of a single MAMP and one or more DAMPs. Importantly, the FIRE gene set provides a new tool for unraveling the redundancies in downstream kinase signaling that are predicted to confer system robustness in the face of pathogen effector attack., We performed an extensive RNA-seq analysis and VIGS screen to identify novel genes contributing to the plant immune response. The host response to flgII-28 and various bacterial strains indicated that flagellin is by far the major MAMP recognized by tomato. A Pseudomonas syringae mutant lacking two early acting effectors (AvrPto and AvrPtoB) allowed the identification of a defined set of FIRE genes. Among these FIRE genes, 25 have been previously implicated in plant defense highlighting the relevance of this ‘pathogen-defined’ set of genes. A wall-associated kinase was identified, which, when silenced, compromised the plant immune response to bacterial infection. The FIRE genes provide a unique resource for dissection of the plant immune system."
"8","The evolution, impact and properties of exonic splice enhancers","Eva Fernández Cáceres, Laurence D Hurst","Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath","Laurence D Hurst","l.d.hurst@bath.ac.uk","20 December 2013","In humans, much of the information specifying splice sites is not at the splice site. Exonic splice enhancers are one of the principle non-splice site motifs. Four high-throughput studies have provided a compendium of motifs that function as exonic splice enhancers, but only one, RESCUE-ESE, has been generally employed to examine the properties of enhancers. Here we consider these four datasets to ask whether there is any consensus on the properties and impacts of exonic splice enhancers., While only about 1% of all the identified hexamer motifs are common to all analyses we can define reasonably sized sets that are found in most datasets. These consensus intersection datasets we presume reflect the true properties of exonic splice enhancers. Given prior evidence for the properties of enhancers and splice-associated mutations, we ask for all datasets whether the exonic splice enhancers considered are purine enriched; enriched near exon boundaries; able to predict trends in relative codon usage; slow evolving at synonymous sites; rare in SNPs; associated with weak splice sites; and enriched near longer introns. While the intersect datasets match expectations, only one original dataset, RESCUE-ESE, does. Unexpectedly, a fully experimental dataset identifies motifs that commonly behave opposite to the consensus, for example, being enriched in exon cores where splice-associated mutations are rare., Prior analyses that used the RESCUE-ESE set of hexamers captured the properties of consensus exonic splice enhancers. We estimate that at least 4% of synonymous mutations are deleterious owing to an effect on enhancer functioning.","","The identification of splice sites in long metazoan transcripts requires not just splice site sequences. Indeed, it is estimated that only around 50% of the information specifying splice sites is at the splice site itself [1]. In addition there are short stretches within the immature RNA that function as either enhancers or suppressors of splicing. These can be either within the exons or the introns. Here we concentrate on the exonic splice enhancers (ESEs). ESE motifs function in part by binding SR proteins to aid exonic splice site recognition [2, 3]. In addition they may function to help retain unspliced pre-mRNAs in the nucleus [4]., We concentrate on ESEs because, unlike exonic splice suppressors [5], ESEs are claimed to have a profound influence on protein and gene evolution [3, 5–7]. ESEs are thought to be enriched near splice sites [8–10], potentially explaining why exon ends are slower evolving at both synonymous [6] and non-synonymous sites [5] and why SNP density is lower [10, 11]. Closer analysis indeed supports the view that this slower evolution is in large part owing to the impact of purifying selection on ESEs in proximity to exon ends [5–7, 10, 11]. Consistent with this, SNPs responsible for altered splicing are enriched at exonic ends [10]. ESEs appear to be under particularly strong selective constraint up to 50 to 100 bp from exon ends [11]. As the average human exon is approximately 130 bp, this means that for many human exons all of the exon is ‘exon-end’ in the sense that it is a domain in which ESEs can be functional. Given the possibility that ESEs are at a high density (approximately 30% to 40%) at exon ends and that they are evolutionarily conserved, their impact on amino acid and codon usage is of considerable interest to molecular evolutionists., However, most of the above work comes with a potentially serious caveat, in that nearly all prior work on the evolutionary impact of ESEs has employed the same set of putative ESEs (for an exception see [10]), that deduced by Fairbrother et al. [9, 12]. Given that there now exist three other systematic attempts to define sets of putative ESEs, it is relevant to ask whether these sets agree on the properties of ESEs and to what extent they concur as to which hexamers function as ESEs. Considering the sets of hexamers agreed on, at least in part, by the various methods also provides an opportunity to characterise the properties and impact of ESEs. Such issues are not only of interest to the molecular evolutionary community. If, for example, ESEs are under purifying selection then mutations disrupting ESEs are possible causes of splice-associated diseases [3]. Understanding the commonality of purifying selection on ESEs is then of relevance to medical genetics and diagnostics., There have been several different approaches to describe sequences that function as ESEs. Early in-depth approaches identified ESEs by looking for splice-altered disease alleles [13], by mutagenesis of mini-genes and by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [14–16]. Given the binding motifs of a series of SR proteins, applications such as ESEfinder attempt to identify possible ESEs in any given sample of sequence [17]. We do not consider these analyses but rather concentrate on the four systematic attempts to define ESEs., The majority of systematic attempts to define ESEs employ computational approaches, confirmed with experimental support. Typically these approaches start with a presumption about the distribution of ESEs and look for the sequences most enriched in these trends. For example, Fairbrother et al. presumed that ESEs will be enriched in constitutive exons compared with introns and more abundant in exons with weak splice sites than in those with strong splice sites [9, 12]. Looking for 6-mers enriched on both of these axes led to a candidate set of ESEs. A similar approach, but one avoiding potential confounding with amino acid coding, was taken by Zhang and Chasin [18]. This group identified motifs enriched in internal non-coding exons of protein coding genes compared to unspliced pseudo-exons and 5’ untranslated regions. Goren et al. [19] took an alternative approach and, supposing that functional ESEs should be slow evolving, looked for motifs that were more conserved than expected at synonymous sites. Combining this with evidence for enrichment compared with background codon usage rates led to the identification of a set of exonic splice regulatory motifs, the majority of which proved on experimental confirmation to be ESEs. While a minority were exonic splice inhibitors, the precise numbers are uncertain not least because ESEs can also function as exonic splice inhibitors depending on their position and context within the exon [20]., While these three predominantly computational approaches have provided an extensive compendium of ESE sequences it is possible that they are not exhaustive. Given, too, the possibility of conditional and position dependent effects, recently Ke et al. [20] adopted an experimental high-throughput approach by considering the effects of all possible 4,096 6-mers at five locations in two model exons. Taking into account overlap sequences this permitted the identification of numerous ESE hexamers., Here we consider the ESEs provided by the four analyses so as to ask whether there is now any general consensus on the properties of ESEs and to ask whether any dataset may be particularly different from the others. We start by considering the overlap between the four groups. Then we consider a series of possible diagnostics of ESEs., First, we ask about purine content. The earliest experimentally determined ESEs tended to purine rich [9, 21–23]. Indeed, the binding sites of the SR protein SF2/ASF, for example, are over 80% purine [24]. The pure purine hexamer GAAGAA appears to be one of the strongest ESEs [9]. Subsequently some AC-rich motifs and pyrimidine motifs have, however, been identified [14, 25]., Second, we ask about intra-exon location. A considerable body of work implicates ESEs as functioning close to exon junctions [8–10], not least the finding that SNPs demonstrated to alter splicing, but not at splice sites, tend to be close to exon boundaries [10]. We thus ask about the trend in usage of ESEs in the vicinity of junctions. Specifically, we ask whether their usage declines as one moves towards the core of the exon. Similarly, it has been noted that the relative usage of many synonymous codons changes as one approaches exon-intron junctions [26, 27]. Usage of a codon within an ESE (as defined by RESCUE-ESE) predicts these trends [26, 27]. We thus employ a previously derived statistical method, HPI [5], to establish the usage of each codon within any given set of ESEs and then ask whether the set of ESEs is then consistent with observed trends in relative usage of pairs of synonymous codons., We additionally ask whether ESEs impose purifying selection at synonymous sites. If the ESE motifs are functional they should probably be under purifying selection most of the time, this presumption underpinning the method of Goren et al. [19]. Analysis of the RESCUE-ESE motifs supports this position [5–7, 10, 11]. To address this we ask about the rate of evolution of four-fold degenerate synonymous sites in and out of ESEs as a function of the distance from the exon ends, controlling for differential nucleotide usage. In addition, and related, we ask about the frequency of SNPs in ESE and non-ESE sequence, under the expectation that ESEs should harbour fewer SNPs [7, 11], not because they mutate less, but rather because purifying selection should remove them from a population or force them to low frequency (making them less likely to be evidenced)., An association between ESEs and with weak splice sites is commonly assumed (for example, [9]). This is expected, as it is thought that ESEs can be under selection to compensate for weak splice sites [28], a feature that in turn is dependent in part on the length of the flanking intron [29]. We thus consider whether ESE density is higher in vicinity to weak splice sites and longer introns., We find strong evidence that ESEs impose purifying selection on exonic ends. Given this and given that conserved alternative exons tend to be slow evolving [6, 30, 31], we ask whether this might reflect a higher density of ESEs in either alternative exons or in conserved exons. Finally, we use information gathered to estimate the proportion of synonymous mutations that are under selection owing to their disrupting ESE function. We start by outlining the four methods in more detail so as to clarify the possible biases intrinsic in each approach., Early detailed studies of binding sites for SR proteins and exonic splice enhancer elements suggested a view of ESEs that has remained largely consistent with most systematic analyses and analyses of where within exons mutations that affect splicing are found [10]. That is to say ESEs tend to be purine rich [9, 21–23], enriched near exon ends [8–10] and slow evolving [5–7, 10, 11]. A feature of the enrichment near exon ends is that knowledge of ESEs enables one to predict relative synonymous codon usage [27]. In addition ESE density is higher near weak splice sites and near longer introns. Importantly, all of these conclusions are robustly supported by what one might consider to be the datasets with the lowest false positive rate, namely the two three-way intersection datasets., The consensus ESE sets support the notion that ESEs are purine rich, most common at exonic ends (and capable of explaining skews in codon usage towards exon ends), subject to purifying selection and more common when the flanking intron is long and when the splice site is weak. Of the original datasets RESCUE-ESE captures these trends, while the recent experimental dataset of Ke et al. behaves in many regards opposite to the consensus. We estimate that approximately 4% of synonymous mutations are deleterious owing to alteration of splicing mediated by disruption of ESEs."

Despite decades of research, most studies focus on only a small number of TFs and the roles of many remain unknown., We present a systematic characterization of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns for all known or predicted Drosophila TFs throughout embryogenesis, the first such comprehensive study for any metazoan animal. We generated RNA expression patterns for all 708 TFs by in situ hybridization, annotated the patterns using an anatomical controlled vocabulary, and analyzed TF expression in the context of organ system development. Nearly all TFs are expressed during embryogenesis and more than half are specifically expressed in the central nervous system. Compared to other genes, TFs are enriched early in the development of most organ systems, and throughout the development of the nervous system. Of the 535 TFs with spatially restricted expression, 79% are dynamically expressed in multiple organ systems while 21% show single-organ specificity. Of those expressed in multiple organ systems, 77 TFs are restricted to a single organ system either early or late in development. Expression patterns for 354 TFs are characterized for the first time in this study., We produced a reference TF dataset for the investigation of gene regulatory networks in embryogenesis, and gained insight into the expression dynamics of the full complement of TFs controlling the development of each organ system.","","Tissue development and organ morphogenesis programs require tight spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. Gene regulatory mechanisms rely on a wide range of proteins, including transcription factors, co-activators, chromatin remodelers, and signaling pathway components. Site-specific DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in controlling gene expression by interacting with specific regulatory DNA elements to activate or repress transcription. Modulated through signaling pathways and protein interactions, TFs set up the transcriptional programs that ultimately specify cell fates and coordinate tissue and organ formation., Our understanding of regulatory circuit architecture developed from extensive genetic studies, but most of these focused on a small subset of regulators and examined a limited number of tissues or stages (for example, [1]). Genomic technologies enable systematic annotation of regulatory elements in multiple contexts, and increased the scale of known regulatory connections. Regulatory element annotation efforts are underway for multiple organisms: human [2], fly [3, 4], worm [5], and mouse [6], and these datasets provide a foundation to analyze and model gene regulation. However, understanding the spatial and temporal control of gene expression requires the integration of data beyond the catalog of DNA elements. A systematic analysis of TFs requires knowledge of where TFs are expressed, how they interact with DNA, and how they interact with other factors., Spatial expression profiling using in situ hybridization is one approach to systematically examine gene expression patterns during development, and is a central assay in establishing regulatory links between TFs and regulatory elements. Large-scale embryonic mRNA expression pattern screens have been completed or are in progress for a number of model organisms including C. elegans, C. intestinalis, D. melanogaster, G. gallus, and X. laevis[7–14] and for specific tissue or developmental systems (for example, FlyTED, a Drosophila testis expression database, [15], and the Allen Brain Atlas of the adult mouse brain [16]). These large datasets provide a wealth of information about tissue and organ development, and can be used to find co-regulated genes and identify genes with similar functions [13, 17, 18]. Previously, as part of the ongoing Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP) embryonic gene expression pattern genome-wide screen, we profiled 30% of the transcription factors with sequence-specific DNA-binding domains [13]. Reports in the literature (compiled by FlyBase [19]) include selected spatial expression data, either mRNA or protein, for 354 TFs. However, many TFs remain poorly characterized, and half lack any description of their embryonic spatial expression patterns., A standard method to summarize spatial gene expression data is manual annotation using a controlled anatomical vocabulary (reviewed in [20]). For Drosophila, we developed a controlled vocabulary of 314 primary terms, described previously [13]. Anatomical terms that are part of a larger structure are linked by the ‘part of’ relationship and terms for structures that develop from one to another are linked by the ‘develops from’ relationship, so that the annotations track expression in developing tissues across stages. The primary terms can be generalized into a set of ‘collapsed terms’ that group rare or hard to distinguish terms with their more general parent term. The collapsed terms can be grouped further into organ systems to study organogenesis. The consistent annotation of expression patterns transforms the data into a format that enables integration with other genomic datasets and comparison of tissue expression patterns across species (4DXpress) [21]., We applied our large-scale in situ hybridization pipeline [13, 22] to survey embryonic mRNA spatial expression patterns of all known and predicted Drosophila TFs (708) with sequence-specific DNA-binding domains (DBDs). This new dataset allows us to examine TF expression patterns in the context of 6,334 other genes profiled using the same experimental platform and annotation terms. We leveraged Model Organism ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (modENCODE) RNA-seq datasets to evaluate and validate properties of transcription factor mRNA expression. In contrast to previous studies, we examined the set of TFs expressed in the context of 16 organ systems, followed TF expression trajectories across development and identified regulators driving organogenesis. From our data we detected novel relationships and differences among transcriptional programs during organ system development. This is the first comprehensive TF study of this scale for any metazoan organism., Expression patterns for sequence-specific TFs comprise a critical biological dataset because of the central role of TFs in transcriptional regulatory networks that control the development of multicellular organisms. We used DNA-binding protein domains to identify a comprehensive list of 708 sequence specific TFs in Drosophila and performed experiments specifically to generate a complete reference data set of spatial expression patterns during embryonic development. Despite the importance of TFs, most publications focus on a relatively small number of TFs, and even previous large surveys included only half of the TFs in this dataset. Spatial expression patterns for 354 TFs are described for the first time in our study. Even in the most intensively studied embryonic stage (that is, blastoderm) and well-characterized organ systems (for example, Meso/Muscle or CNS), we identified new regulatory players., Consistent with the view of pervasive combinatorial TF action, we find that most TFs with patterned expression are expressed dynamically in multiple organ systems (79%). The remaining 21% of the patterned TFs are expressed in only a single organ system during either organ system specification (early) or differentiation (late). We conclude that TF regulatory networks utilize both promiscuously expressed TFs and uniquely expressed TFs with roles devoted to the development of individual organs., From our examination of TF expression in organogenesis, we discovered new associations of TFs co-expressed in organ-specific regulatory networks, suggesting candidates for further investigation through genetic and biochemical studies and higher-resolution imaging [46]. The images from our collection are a new resource for image-based analysis, which can be used to identify expression pattern components and relationships not captured in the annotations [18], and extended to include the analysis of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) proximal to TFs [47]. Our complete dataset and our focus on TF expression in the major organ systems allow new TF network analysis and investigation into the role of TF combinatorial complexity in organogenesis."

The species recently colonized a small continental archipelago, the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, where it has been facing novel environmental conditions and limited resource availability. To explore the genomic consequences of this ecological shift, we analyze the transcriptomic variability of five individuals of C. nigra, and compare it to similar data obtained from several continental species of turtles., Having clarified the timing of divergence in the Chelonoidis genus, we report in C. nigra a very low level of genetic polymorphism, signatures of a weakened efficacy of purifying selection, and an elevated mutation load in coding and regulatory sequences. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of an extremely low long-term effective population size in this insular species. Functional evolutionary analyses reveal a reduced diversity of immunity genes in C. nigra, in line with the hypothesis of attenuated pathogen diversity in islands, and an increased selective pressure on genes involved in response to stress, potentially related to the climatic instability of its environment and its elongated lifespan. Finally, we detect no population structure or homozygosity excess in our five-individual sample., These results enlighten the molecular evolution of an endangered taxon in a stressful environment and point to island endemic species as a promising model for the study of the deleterious effects on genome evolution of a reduced long-term population size.","","Evolution on islands is a fascinating topic. A number of plant and animal species are known to be endemic from small islands or archipelagos, having evolved in isolation from their continental relatives during long periods of time. Such systems are typically seen as natural laboratories for the study of adaptation [1]. Invading an island means entering a new biotic environment, that is, a new community of competitors, predators, preys and parasites, and a reduced total amount of available food. This sudden ecological challenge must be faced by a supposedly small number of migrants, in a context of reduced or null gene flow from the mainland. The successful colonization of an island by a new species is therefore likely to be driven by rapid adaptive evolution. Consistently, evolution on islands is often associated with rapid morphological changes [2], the observation of which has been of major importance in Darwinâs thoughts and conceptions. In the genomic era, the search for the molecular targets of such adaptive processes appears as a promising quest., A second reason why island endemic species are of specific interest to evolutionary biologists is their supposedly reduced population size. The effective population size (N
                e) is a central parameter of the population genetic theory, which determines the strength of genetic drift, the random fluctuation of allele frequencies generation after generation. The theory makes a number of important predictions regarding the influence of N
                e on patterns of molecular diversity. First, small populations are expected to be genetically less diverse than large populations because of the reduced sojourn time of neutral mutations in the former. The existing data seem in broad agreement with this prediction at a wide phylogenetic scale [3, 4]. In studies of more restricted taxonomic groups, a relationship between population size predictors and genetic diversity has been reported in fish [5], but not in mammals [6] or birds [7], despite abundant genetic data in the latter two taxa., Importantly, genetic drift is also expected to decrease the efficiency of natural selection, as it pushes the frequency of an allele up and down irrespective of its contribution to fitness. Consequently, natural selection in favor of slightly advantageous mutations and in disfavor of slightly deleterious mutations is supposed to be less efficient in small than in large populations [8]. It was convincingly argued that the N
                e effect is the major explanation for the difference in genome architecture between prokaryotes and large organisms [9]. Besides this contrast, it would appear important to determine whether the N
                e effect on selection efficiency is detectable at a more recent phylogenetic scale, that is, between closely-related species. In particular, whether species affected by a recent drop in population size are âgenetically endangeredâ (that is, suffer from an increased load of deleterious mutations) is still debated [6, 10]., To date, empirical evidence regarding the influence of N
                e on the efficiency of natural selection is not so abundant. The most convincing contribution was the report in mammals of a positive correlation between body mass and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (d
                N/d
                S) [11]. An increased d
                N/d
                S ratio is expected when the efficiency of purifying selection against deleterious non-synonymous changes is weakened. The mammalian pattern was therefore interpreted as a N
                e effect, plausibly assuming that populations of large animals tend to be smaller than populations of small animals, on average. Still in mammals, the evolutionary rate of non-coding sequences upstream and downstream of genes was reported to be faster in primates than in rodents, which was interpreted in terms of a reduced N
                e in primates [12]., One problem for testing the population size effect on patterns of molecular variation is that we typically have no direct measurement of N
                e, which in the above-cited studies was indirectly approached through various surrogates (for example, body mass, conservation status, marine vs. terrestrial habitat). The long-term average N
                e, which is the relevant parameter in molecular evolution, may be badly predicted by current species abundance [6, 7]. Islands provide a good opportunity to cope with these problems: island endemic species are likely to have evolved in small populations during long periods of time, owing to the overall limitation in space and resource availability. Consistent with this prediction, an increased d
                N/d
                S ratio for mitochondrial genes was reported in island endemic species, as compared to their mainland relatives [13, 14], which was again interpreted as reflecting a weakened efficiency of purifying selection due to a smaller long-term N
                e., The signature of a reduced N
                e in the islands, although significant, was only observed in approximately 60% of the island/mainland couples [14], perhaps because of a lack of power - just one or two genes were analyzed for each species pair (and see reference [15]). It should also be noted that the d
                N/d
                S ratio, used in most of the above-mentioned studies, is not only determined by the strength of purifying selection, but also by the rate of adaptive amino-acid substitutions, which in some species can be far from negligible [16]. If adaptation on islands was a prominent process at the molecular level too, then the d
                N/d
                S ratio might be inflated independently of demographic effects. In this case, the ratio of non-synonymous over synonymous polymorphism (ÏN/ÏS), not divergence, would be a more appropriate marker of a reduced N
                e, since it is much less affected by adaptive evolution than the d
                N/d
                S ratio [17]. The availability of within-species variation data is therefore of primary importance to disentangle the adaptive vs. non-adaptive forces driving molecular evolution on islands., Here we present a population genomic study of the giant GalÃ¡pagos tortoise, Chelonoidis nigra, an endangered species endemic from the GalÃ¡pagos archipelago. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses suggested that this insular species has been isolated from the South American continent during millions of years [18, 19]. C. nigra is together with the Aldabra tortoise the largest known living species of terrestrial turtles, much larger than its mainland congenerics, and can live well above 100 years. Its new environment, the GalÃ¡pagos archipelago, is affected by strong climatic fluctuations in space and time, with some islands being generally quite arid, and all of them experiencing long periods of drought associated to âEl NiÃ±oâ southern oscillations [20]. C. nigra is therefore a perfect model for the study of adaptation following island colonization. On the other hand, its large size combined to its endemic status is suggestive of a small long-term N
                e for this species, which might have favored non-adaptive evolution through reinforced genetic drift. To test these hypotheses and quantify the relative influence of positive vs. purifying selection, the transcriptomic diversity of five individuals was investigated and compared to similar data gathered in several continental species of turtle., Genome-wide studies have been so far largely restricted to model organisms, that is, domestic or laboratory species. Here, thanks to NGS technologies, we were able to characterize for the first time the transcriptomic variability and population genomics of an endangered, emblematic species, the giant GalÃ¡pagos tortoise, in absence of prior genomic knowledge., One specificity of our sample is the lack of geographic information: we do not exactly know from which locality and each island of the GalÃ¡pagos archipelago the sampled individuals come from. This is a general problem with C. nigra: previous genetic studies have shown that the current location of a turtle is not a reliable indicator of its true origin because of human-made translocations [21, 31]. For this reason, these studies concluded that a genetic assignment of lineage of origin is the most trustworthy tool to use. Our sample, which covers a wide range of C. nigra mitochondrial and microsatellite lineages, is appropriate with respect to this criterion. Importantly, our analysis revealed no departure from panmixy in C. nigra. This is the most favorable situation for studying population genomics and molecular evolution, in which any random sample of individuals is expected to provide an unbiased estimate of the species genetic diversity, irrespective of geography. We conclude that this potential concern regarding sampling is unlikely to affect our conclusions, even though they would be worth confirming based on a larger population sample., Our analyses of transcriptomic diversity in C. nigra revealed that molecular evolution in the giant GalÃ¡pagos tortoise is strongly influenced by an increased rate of genetic drift, which weakens the efficiency of natural selection and creates a substantial mutation load. The relaxation of purifying selection affects most genes, regulatory regions, and functions, with the exception of genes involved in response to stress, on which selective pressure has been reinforced, presumably in response to the new environmental conditions and elongated life span in this species. This study points to insular species as a promising model to explore further the effect of genetic drift on genomic patterns, and its relationship with gene function and adaptation."
"11","The spliceosomal catalytic core arose in the RNA worldâ¦ or did it?","W Ford Doolittle","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University","W Ford Doolittle","ford@dal.ca","13 December 2013","","","A new study adds to the evidence for a common evolutionary origin of the spliceosome and group II introns, but RNA-world questions remain., Joseph Piccirilli and colleagues at the University of Chicago appear to have driven a final nail in the coffin of any remaining doubt that the spliceosome is, at its catalytic heart, a ribozyme. Their recent Nature article shows that U6 snRNA (a key spliceosome component) is by itself capable of catalyzing canonical splicing reactions [1]. Not unexpectedly, they conclude that âthe common catalytic mechanism used by the spliceosome and group II introns is consistent with a common evolutionary originâ. And they go on to claim that their findings âsupport the idea that modern ribonucleoprotein enzymes evolved from a primordial âRNA worldâ in which catalysis was performed exclusively by RNA.â There might well have been such a world, and some modern ribozymes might still carry its heritage, but it would be wrong to think that the data of Piccirilli and colleagues lend any additional support to this already very popular evolutionary conjecture or to conclude that this conjecture is close to proven., I will explain at the end why I offer these quibbles, but first, what did Piccirilli and colleagues show that was not known before? It has been known since the 1980s that both self-splicing group II and spliceosomal mRNA introns are excised by a two-step trans-esterification mechanism involving a branched intermediate, known as a lariat. As the former can proceed without protein, perhaps the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) at the core of the spliceosome were also the catalytic agent, not the hundred-plus associated splicing and auxiliary proteins. In his memorably titled one-page 1991 essay âFive-easy piecesâ, Phil Sharp â reasoning by analogy from the trans-splicing of fragmented genes in chloroplasts â speculated that the five snRNAs were fragments of an ancestral group II intron, reassembling at the beginning of each intron to form something like the ancestral catalytic ribozyme structure [2]. Spliceosomal proteins would serve merely to assist and stabilize., Structural and functional similarities between group II and spliceosomal intron RNAs looking very like homologies continue to be documented, and, in 2001, Valadkhan and Manley showed that a protein-free complex of two snRNAs, U2 and U6, is catalytic, performing a reaction ârelated to the first step of splicingâ [3]. What Piccirilliâs team has now done is show that U6 snRNA can catalyze the exact same two-step reaction as that of group II ribozymes, using metal ligands that âcorrespond directly to catalytic metal ligands in domain V in structures of a group II intronâ., Although we really do not know how unlikely it is that this same structure would have been achieved twice by convergence, most biologists will probably accept this as compelling evidence that group II and spliceosomal splicing machineries are indeed related. That is, either the latter is derived from the former, the former is derived from the latter, or both descend from a common ancestor that was neither. It seems most unlikely that snRNAs â dispersed and addicted to protein helpers for assembly as they are â could have gotten together into one molecule and stripped down to make a self-splicing group II intron. And an ancestral entity that was neither group II nor spliceosomal seems not to be known anywhere. So Sharp was probably right., Speculations over the evolutionary relationships of introns and spliceosomes to the genomes they infest have a history almost as complex as these structures themselves. Most sensible people accept Tom Cavalier-Smithâs notion [4] that eukaryotes âcaughtâ mobile (âselfishâ) group II introns from the bacterial progenitor of the mitochondrion, and these then degenerated into snRNAs, recruiting multiple splicing proteins (some perhaps already engaged in stabilizing ribozymatic activity). All extant eukaryotic nuclear genomes, with one exception, suffer from introns, and all extant eukaryotes appear once to have had (if not still to have) mitochondria. So that all fits. And the falling apart into five pieces must have happened early, quickly and completely, if not also easily. There are no known group II introns in eukaryotic nuclear genomes and there is considerable conservation of the splicing machinery (including key spliceosomal proteins of the U2 or U12 systems) between eukaryotic lineages [5]., Work from Marlene Belfortâs lab [6] identifies one force that might have persuaded recently introduced group II introns to give up their independence in eukaryotes, except in organelles, where they indeed persist. Belfort and colleagues showed that a bacterial group II intron introduced into a yeast nuclear gene renders its transcript subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and (mysteriously) difficult to translate, even when spliced. Bill Martin and Eugene Koonin imagine, with much more drama, âthe existence of a turbulent phase of genome evolution in the wake of mitochondrial origin, during which group II introns invaded the hostâs chromosomes, spread as transposable elements into hundreds â perhaps thousands â of positions that have been conserved to the present, and fragmented into both mRNA introns and snRNA constituents of the spliceosomeâ [7]. For them, the host for the mitochondrial vector of the intron disease was as yet a prokaryote, and the nucleus evolved as a way to temporally separate splicing from translation, with which it would otherwise interfere., The second commonly accepted evolutionary belief about introns that Piccirilli and colleagues claim to strengthen is that their ribozymatic activity is a direct and uninterrupted inheritance from the RNA world â and indeed is evidence that such a world once existed. Maybe that world existed, but the results of Piccirilli and colleagues do not add to the evidence for it. If spliceosomal introns indeed descend from group II introns and the latter are indeed self-splicing because they inherited their catalytic core from the RNA world, then how spliceosomal introns work today is irrelevant. Itâs only if we believed that the catalytic activities of group II introns and spliceosomal introns descended separately from an ancestor in the RNA world that Piccirilli and coworkers would have provided further evidence for âthe idea that modern ribonucleoprotein enzymes evolved from a primordial âRNA worldâ.â, And for that matter, why do we think that the catalytic activity of group II introns is an RNA-world relic? For the ribozymal catalytic core of the ribosome, there is a very good case to be made [8]. Translation presumably preceded the appearance of modern ribosomal proteins and it strains credulity to imagine a ribozyme substituting itself at the heart of an already functioning and obviously essential proteinaceous machinery., Not so for introns, even of group II, which the cell can take or leave. We know that RNA has extraordinary evolutionary potential, even now: venture capitalists have invested fortunes in companies developing ribozymes for therapeutic purposes. We also know that transposable elements have their own evolutionary impetus and that, in principle at least, the most successful will do the least harm. Why could not ribozymatic group II intron splicing have been invented later, in a DNA world? Curcio and Belfort [9], for instance, once mooted that perhaps âthe ability of group II introns to self-splice out of an RNA transcript developed from a reverse-splicing retroelement, owing to the selective pressure to reduce the deleterious effects of insertionâ â a co-evolutionary model nicely elaborated more recently by Toor et al.[10]., That group II introns are found in both bacteria and archaea is no proof that they are truly ancient RNA retroelements: they are infectious agents capable of interdomain transfer. Certainly, that there are such ribozymatic activities is good evidence that an RNA world was possible. But it is neither compelling evidence that such a world really existed nor an indication that modern exemplars have ancient origins. Too readily do we assume that the existing entities by analogy to which we construct pre-cellular evolutionary scenarios are themselves relics of those ancient days. Relics are funny things, for all that they can resemble inferred ancestors. That they are still around suggests that there is selection to maintain them â however, such selection might also then create them de novo, even now."

Here, we present TRAPID, an online tool for the fast and efficient processing of assembled RNA-Seq transcriptome data, developed to mitigate these challenges. TRAPID offers high-throughput open reading frame detection, frameshift correction and includes a functional, comparative and phylogenetic toolbox, making use of 175 reference proteomes. Benchmarking and comparison against state-of-the-art transcript analysis tools reveals the efficiency and unique features of the TRAPID system. TRAPID is freely available at http://​bioinformatics.​psb.​ugent.​be/​webtools/​trapid/​., Technological advances in sequencing have made it possible to rapidly and cost-effectively take a snapshot of gene expression in a specific tissue or condition and have led to an explosion of transcriptome RNA-Seq data. With the Petabase barrier having been reached at the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) database at the end of 2012 [1], new approaches to deal with this surge in data quantity are required. For the plant kingdom alone, more than 4,200 transcriptome experiments covering more than 390 species are available at the SRA. Over 90% of these species do not have an available draft or complete genome sequence, making the data processing and biological interpretation a challenging task. In case a reference genome is available, the short reads can be processed using alignment-first (or align-then-assemble) methods that provide a genome-guided approach to study splice site junctions, identify new or alternative transcripts, or to quantify expression levels using known gene annotations [2]. In contrast, for species without a reference genome, assemble-then-align methods require that the millions of reads are first processed using de novo assembly before the reconstructed transcriptome is further characterized [3]. Examples of downstream analysis include the remapping of the input sequence reads from the different libraries to the assembled transcripts to quantify expression levels, the remapping of all reads to assess the genetic diversity within a genotype, or the alignment of the assembled transcripts against genome or transcripts sequences from closely-related species., The development and improvement of de novo transcript assembly tools is an active research field and algorithms like OASES/Velvet, Trans-ABySS, and SOAPdenovo [3–6] provide efficient tools to reconstruct transcriptomes for non-model species starting from raw sequence reads. Despite the fact that both library normalization and increased sequencing depths (or higher coverage) will have a positive influence on the completeness of a transcriptome [7], most de novo transcriptome studies typically present gene catalogues where the number of transcripts after the assembly phase exceeds the estimated number of genes [8]. This pattern is mainly the result from redundancy caused by the presence of partial, unassembled, or highly heterozygous sequences. Despite these imperfections, de novo transcriptomes provide a sequence backbone for various non-model species and, in line with traditional genome projects, the detailed annotation of these transcript sequences is an essential step for downstream biological analysis., Although the workflow to process transcriptome data is highly dependent on the type of analysis, functional annotation for the assembled transcripts is often generated using sequence similarity searches against a reference database. Clearly, the default application of large-scale sequence similarity searches against databases like NCBI or UniProtKB, which contain annotated proteins, drastically increases the amount of data that needs to be interpreted to derive functional annotations. Currently, systems like KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) [9], Blast2GO [10], and T-ACE [11] provide tools for non-expert users to perform functional characterization of transcript sequences, but both the throughput as well as the quality of the reference datasets are important factors influencing the biological knowledge that can be extracted from non-model transcriptomes. Whereas systems like KAAS and Blast2GO can be operated through an Internet browser, T-ACE requires the installation of a PostgreSQL database on local hardware. Although both Blast2GO and T-ACE can derive functional annotations from a BLAST search against NCBI or through protein domain identification using InterProScan, the associated runtimes grow rapidly, hindering the efficient processing of a complete transcriptome dataset. Furthermore, the quality of the functional annotations of known sequences as well as the number of species or genes included in reference databases will have an impact on the success of translating transcript sequences into functional gene catalogs. Tools which apply the Gene Ontology (GO) controlled vocabulary benefit from the different functional levels embedded in the ontology structure, while systems like KEGG Orthology provide detailed information but only for a limited number of genes. Apart from functional annotations, the analysis of transcripts from non-model species using comparative genomics can also generate valuable information about conserved pathways, gene family expansions, species-specific genes, and genetic diversity [12–15]. However, performing such evolutionary analyses for thousands of transcripts is computationally expensive and user-friendly interfaces to compare de novo transcriptomes with high-quality reference genomes are still missing., To address some of the issues inherent to the analysis of de novo transcriptomes, we present TRAPID, a web-based and high-throughput analysis pipeline that uses predefined reference databases. Available analyses include the automatic identification of coding sequences in transcripts, correcting frameshifts, assigning coding-sequences to multi-species gene families, performing transcript quality control, and generating functional annotations. Furthermore, detailed multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees can easily be generated providing a comparative framework for the analysis of non-model transcriptomes. Finally, quantitative comparisons can be performed to study functional biases in transcriptome subsets derived from different tissues or conditions., To provide a web-based resource for the high-throughput processing of assembled transcriptomes derived from de novo RNA-Seq experiments or classical EST sequencing, a two-step procedure was developed. First, large-scale sequence similarity searches and open-reading frame (ORF) detection are combined to identify coding sequences, assign transcripts to gene families, identify partial/full length transcripts, and generate homology-based functional annotations. In a second step, detailed sequence analysis can be performed on-the-fly to correct frameshifts and study transcripts within an evolutionary context using multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees (Figure 1). Although building a transcriptome analysis pipeline based on standard components for similarity searches and ORF detection is relatively straightforward, the large number of sequences and the fragmented nature of RNA-Seq data turns balancing the processing speed and quality into a highly challenging task. Furthermore, performing benchmarks to validate the designed computational protocol adds an additional layer of complexity. This section outlines the basic features of the TRAPID system while the following two sections focus on the implementation and benchmarking of specific analysis components. The last section provides a case study that illustrates how TRAPID can be used to quickly infer specific functional annotations for transcriptome subsets in a transparent and reproducible manner.

                        Schematic overview of the TRAPID pipeline. The TRAPID pipeline consists of two separate steps. The first one is a non-interactive processing step, during which all transcripts are assigned to gene families using a RAPSearch2 similarity search, followed by functional annotation transfer and meta-annotation assignment. The second step is interactive and directly commanded through the website interface. Here, the user has the ability to analyze his data using functional enrichment analyses, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic trees.
                    , After the user creates a personal account, logs in into the TRAPID system and uploads a set of assembled transcripts (called an ‘experiment’), a sequence similarity search using RAPSearch2 [16] is executed against a specific protein database selected by the user (Figure 1). ‘Reference proteome’ databases refer to the full set of proteins for a given species or clade based on integrated genomes from PLAZA 2.5 [17] or OrthoMCL-DB version 5 [18]. As these genome resources also contain precomputed gene families, the TRAPID database ‘Gene family representatives’ contains one representative protein for each species present in a given gene family (see Methods). The reference proteomes makes it possible to select an appropriate specific taxonomic level and the full set of associated proteins based on the species the transcripts are originating from, while the latter provides a good alternative for the efficient processing of datasets within a broad taxonomic context, for example, in case no closely-related species with a reference proteome is available. Through the TRAPID website, we offer users a variety of reference protein databases and precomputed gene families (Table 1). Apart from 175 species-specific proteomes (25 from PLAZA and 150 from OrthoMCL-DB, including >2 million proteins) covering 25 plants, 115 non-plant eukaryotes, 36 Bacteria and 16 Archaea, 12 different clade, and two ‘Gene family representatives’ databases were generated to assign transcripts to families in a high-throughput manner. The provided reference proteomes and gene families offer a broad phylogenetic sample and a high-quality backbone for the comparative genomics features of TRAPID [19–21].Table 1

By default these frame statistics are submitted to a simple routine that extracts the associated longest ORF within the frame showing similarity with reference proteins (see Methods). However, this information is also used to predict whether specific transcripts contain putative frameshifts, which can, in a later stage and through the website, be automatically corrected using FrameDP, a self-training tool to predict peptide sequences in mature mRNA sequences [22]. The association of a transcript to a specific gene family is also used to facilitate the transfer of functional consensus Gene Ontology and protein domain information to transcripts. Finally, meta-information with regards to the length of the ORF of a transcript is generated, by comparing the ORF’s length to the average coding sequence length of the genes in the reference gene family., The second phase of the pipeline is performed interactively through the website, during which the transcripts associated with each gene family can be analyzed in more detail using homologous proteins from a set of reference species selected by the user. For transcripts that were flagged as potentially containing frameshifts, the user can execute FrameDP to putatively correct the transcript sequence and identify the correct ORF. Furthermore, based on the inferred coding sequences, per gene family a multiple sequence alignment is generated using MUSCLE [23] and the protein conservation of different transcripts with homologs from related species can be inspected using JalView [24]. Finally, after the application of an automatic editing routine for removing non-homologous alignment positions (see Methods), a phylogenetic tree is constructed using FastTree2 [25] or PhyML [26] providing a means to identify orthologous and paralogous gene relationships or trace putative allelic transcript variants (Figure 2).

                    , Whereas the evolutionary analyses are based on predefined gene families from either OrthoMCL-DB or PLAZA, in some cases these families contain multiple out-paralogous sub-types (sub-clades within a family originating from an ancient gene duplication event predating most speciation events in the tree). As a consequence, some transcripts will be assigned to big gene families covering multiple genes, making phylogenetic analysis difficult. Therefore, in case a single species Reference Proteome is selected (Figure 1), it is possible to first assign transcripts to individual reference genes, for example, from a closely-related model species, and in a second phase build custom gene families through the inclusion of PLAZA integrative orthologs. These orthologs were identified using an ensemble method combining OrthoMCL, reconciled phylogenetic trees, colinearity information, and multispecies best hits and inparalogs (BHI) families [17], including inparalogs. In contrast to homologous gene families, families based on integrative orthology will contain a smaller number of genes, cover less outparalogs, and thus make downstream comparative analyses more feasible and the interpretation of complex families easier. Optionally, the user can also discard some species within a specific gene family in order to reduce the number of proteins before executing the phylogenetic tree construction routine. However, it is advisable to include as many species as possible in order to maintain a good taxon sampling and reduce phylogenetic error [27]., Apart from the functional annotation of individual transcripts, TRAPID also supports the quantitative analysis of experiment subsets using GO and protein domain enrichment statistics. Through the association of specific labels to sets of sequences, transcripts can be annotated with specific sample information (for example, tissue, developmental stage, control, or treatment condition) and be used to perform within-transcriptome functional analysis. Based on the integrated functional transcript annotation, enrichment analysis can subsequently be used to study the biological properties of specific experiment subsets or to compare the functional biases present in, for example, a treatment/control transcriptome experiment setup., The TRAPID platform does not necessarily have to be the endpoint of a transcriptome analysis. In order to facilitate subsequent data analysis, multiple export functions have been added to the platform: all sequences, functional annotations, and phylogenetic data content can be downloaded by the user in a tab-delimited format. Collaborative work on a single transcriptome dataset is encouraged by the ability to share a TRAPID experiment between multiple users. The user who creates the experiment, is considered to be the ‘owner’ (and as such has the ability to empty or remove it), and this user can share his experiment with other TRAPID users (who can browse and edit). This prevents unnecessary data replication or sharing of user credentials., As shown in Figure 1, the first step is to assign each transcript to a predefined homologous gene family. Because transcriptome datasets for species lacking a reference genome sequence can contain more than 100,000 transcripts [8] (with a large fraction being fragments, allelic variants, splice variants, or highly expressed non-coding genes), the efficient processing of all these transcripts is essential to provide users with results within a reasonable timeframe. Two sequence similarity tools were considered: BLASTX [28] and RapSearch2 [16]. The transcript-to-family assignment results were compared using different protein reference databases with varying size, as the size of the database also influences the total runtime. BLASTX is often used to find proteins similar to a query gene in a large database, but requires a large amount of processing time. RapSearch2 was designed to perform the same searches but for short reads, and uses more efficient data structures to significantly speed up this process. Both tools were run using 1,000 randomly selected Arabidopsis thaliana transcripts against different databases containing all proteins from all species within a specific clade, and the correct assignment of a transcript to a family was evaluated together with the running time. In all evaluations the protein sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata were excluded from the database and the known assignments of Arabidopsis thaliana gene sequences to families from the PLAZA 2.5 database were used as a gold standard. Apart from reference databases containing all proteins for a specific species or clade, the ‘Gene family representatives’ database containing 32,294 proteins was also included in the test (see Methods). Assigning a transcript to a gene family was initially done with the 10 best similarity search hits using a simple majority-voting rule (Methods and Additional file 1). It is clear that both BLASTX and RapSearch2 assigned 87% to 98% of the transcripts to the correct gene family in all runs. For most reference databases the runtimes for RapSearch2 were approximately 10× lower compared to BLASTX, while overall, the gene family assignment quality was comparable. Increasing the reference database from one to multiple species (for example, from the Brassicales, which only contains Carica papaya, to Eudicots, covering 11 species) quickly increases the runtimes for both tools. However, better results with regards to the gene family assignment can be obtained by using a larger database. Various metrics, for example, taking only one or multiple hits into account, were evaluated to assign transcripts to families (Additional file 2). The best performance was generally achieved by considering the best hit when using species/clade reference databases and majority voting using the top five hits when using the ‘Gene family representatives’ database. To avoid overfitting (that is, a modeling error which occurs when a function or procedure is leading to a good fit with the sample data but a poor fit with new data) of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana transcripts, this benchmark was repeated using Oryza sativa spp. japonica (excluding Oryza sativa spp. japonica and Oryza sativa spp. indica from the databases) and Vitis vinifera (excluding Vitis vinifera from the databases), yielding similar results (Additional file 3). Although one would expect the correct assignment rate of a transcript to the corresponding gene family to decrease when the assembly quality of the input transcripts deteriorates, this is not always the case (Additional file 4). As such, even relatively short fragments of transcripts (for example, 50 to 100 nt) can be assigned to the correct gene family. Using manual inspection of the amino acid and sequence similarity information, the user is able to modify the association between a transcript and a family in case the automatic gene family assignment is deemed incorrect., In the absence of a reference genome, transcripts generated using de novo assembly of RNA-Seq reads frequently contain errors (for example, short insertions or deletions) and methods for the downstream analysis of coding sequences should be able to correct for potential frameshifts during ORF detection [29]. Although advanced self-learning algorithms (that is, methods that train themselves based on the input data provided by the user) such as FrameDP [22] exist to correct frameshifts during ORF prediction, running these tools on a complete RNA-Seq transcriptome on-the-fly is computationally unfeasible, even using multi-core or cluster hardware systems. Therefore, we implemented and evaluated a system to first perform the detection of putative frameshifts on all input sequences and subsequently only process these frameshift-containing sequences using FrameDP. This rationale is motivated by the observation that, when running FrameDP on complete plant transcriptomes, such as Helianthus annuus and Pachysandra terminalis[30, 31], in only 3% to 15% of the input sequences a frameshift was identified that could be corrected., Apart from gene family assignments, the Rapsearch2 output is also used to estimate if a frameshift is expected in an input transcript based on the output from the similarity search. For each input transcript the best hit in the reference database is selected and all alignments between this query and hit gene are evaluated. For each alignment the frame of the transcript hit is determined and if no frameshift is present, all alignments should report the same reading frame, which can immediately be used to extract the corresponding longest ORF (Figure 1). To evaluate this method to identify input transcripts containing frameshifts, we selected 1,000 transcripts from Arabidopsis thaliana containing no frameshifts and an equal amount of genes where one insert or deletion was artificially introduced at a random position in the coding sequence of the transcript (see Methods). Databases of various clades, each time excluding Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, were used along with a database containing ‘Gene family representatives’ , to perform similarity searches. We found that, using these alignment-based frame statistics, 72.8% of all transcripts containing a frameshift were correctly identified, with only few (1.8%) false positives in the dataset lacking frameshifts (Additional file 5). To provide a good balance between global ORF quality and processing time, this method was integrated as the default procedure to identify frameshifts and subsequently correct them using FrameDP. The frame statistics suggest a fraction of frameshifts will be missed, especially when they occur near the 5′ or 3′ end of the gene due to relative small truncation of the full-length protein. As such the TRAPID system also provides an option for the user to run FrameDP on all transcripts within a family context., A feature comparison between different publicly available web-tools for transcriptome analysis reveals that TRAPID has some unique properties (Table 2). The BLAST2GO [10] interface is commonly used to assign GO functional information to DNA or protein sequences by using either BLASTX or BLASTP, respectively. Although the BLAST2GO program can also be installed locally, reducing the run-time for the user at the cost of requiring in-house dedicated hardware, we compared TRAPID with the online Blast2GO interface in order to only compare web-based solutions. The KAAS platform [9] provides users with KEGG pathway information for a set of given sequences based on a BLAST bit scores. This functional information is complementary to other functional annotation systems such as GO or protein domains. In contrast to all other tools that focus solely on the functional annotation of input sequences, TRAPID provides additional functionalities to identify and correct frameshifts, perform ORF detection and downstream sequence and phylogenetic analyses (Table 2). The comparative genomics functionalities of TRAPID in particular offer the user an intuitive interface to inspect sequence conservation using multiple sequence alignments and to identify, using phylogenetic tree construction and an extensive set of reference genomes, orthologs in related species.Table 2

                  , We conducted a series of benchmarks to assess both runtime and the transcript coverage of functional assignments for the different web-tools reported in Table 2. As the underlying hardware of the different tools and the load at the moment these experiments were executed are two parameters that cannot fully be corrected for, the results reported in Table 3 only give an approximation of the runtimes to process a complete transcriptome. As dataset we used 25,392 transcripts from Panicum hallii, a model for biofuel research [32]. For the TRAPID web-tool we used the Monocotyledon phylogenetic clade from the PLAZA 2.5 reference database (approximately 190,000 proteins), and for the other tools we used default parameters. The results in Table 3 highlight the much higher (up to 70×) required computational time of BLAST2GO compared to TRAPID or KAAS, while at the same time also being able to functionally annotate a higher amount of transcripts (20% for KAAS, 54% for TRAPID using GO, and 77% for BLAST2GO, respectively). Investigation of the GO terms which were uniquely assigned by BLAST2GO reveals that these annotations are less specific (Additional file 6A) and shows a large bias towards the Cellular Component GO category (Additional file 6B). Examples of very general annotations unique to BLAST2GO cover GO terms like ‘membrane’ , ‘intracellular’ , and ‘binding’. Furthermore, whereas TRAPID applies a conservative consensus model to transfer functions from families to transcript (see Methods), we observed that for many transcript receiving functional annotation solely through BLAST2GO, only one or a few of the BLAST hits support the inferred functions, representing a more liberal annotation approach.Table 3

                  , Apart from the general characterization of a complete transcriptome using various functional annotation systems, the detailed analysis of genes expressed in specific tissues or developmental stages can provide new insights about the underlying biological processes and their regulation. Again starting from the Panicum hallii transcriptome, we analyzed a set of transcripts showing distinct expression profiles in eight tissues for functional biases [32]. After processing all 25,392 contigs using the Oryza sativa ssp. japonica proteome as a reference and including integrative orthologs from the PLAZA 2.5 database, 16,748 (66%) transcripts were assigned to 9,860 gene families. Based on the results of expression clustering reported by Meyer and co-workers, 6,517 transcripts were tagged with a specific label (cluster 1 to 7) and GO enrichment analysis was performed for each subset. Whereas cluster 1, including transcripts with expression in stem-associated tissues, was significantly enriched for carbohydrate metabolism, cytoskeleton/cell wall organization, and shoot development (Additional file 7), seed-specific transcripts (cluster 5) included genes involved in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy, wax metabolism, and cuticle development (P value <0.05, hypergeometric distribution with Bonferroni correction). Transcripts showing differential expression in root and seedling (cluster 3) were enriched for translation, ribosome biogenesis, and rRNA metabolism, while leaf-specific expression (cluster 6) coincided with photosynthesis, energy metabolism, and multicellular organismal development, confirming previous results [32]. Finally, application of GO queries to tissue-specific subsets allows for the identification of transcriptional regulators involved in development. For example, searching for example ‘transcription factor activity’ on subset root (cluster 4) yields 21 transcription factors showing differential expression in root, including multiple CCAAT-binding, NAM, and bZIP proteins., TRAPID provides a publicly available tool to process de novo transcriptomes from animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. This web-based application has been developed to offer a user-friendly interface to functionally characterize assembled transcript sequences and to initiate comparative genomics analyses, enabling scientists with a biological background to explore their non-model transcriptome data in an efficient and high-throughput manner., The website of the TRAPID platform was developed using CakePHP [36] with Flash and JavaScript used for visualizations, except for the Java programs used for the multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees (JalView and Archaeopteryx, respectively). The backend of the online tool consists of a MySQL database [37] with custom Java programs and Perl scripts. A computing cluster (4 AMD Opteron(TM) Processor 6276 cores, 24 Gb of memory) is available allowing the simultaneous processing of up to four different datasets., The TRAPID tool is available online [38]. The source code is also available online [39, 40]. To install the software locally, users need to download and install third party software, as described in the TRAPID README file. General documentation (Additional file 8), a tutorial (Additional file 9) and an example dataset [32] are available on the TRAPID website."

The greyhound locus exhibiting the strongest association, located 150 kilobases upstream of the genes CDKN2A/B, is also the most rearranged locus in canine osteosarcoma tumors. The top germline candidate variant is found at a >90% frequency in Rottweilers and Irish wolfhounds, and alters an evolutionarily constrained element that we show has strong enhancer activity in human osteosarcoma cells. In all three breeds, osteosarcoma-associated loci and regions of reduced heterozygosity are enriched for genes in pathways connected to bone differentiation and growth. Several pathways, including one of genes regulated by miR124, are also enriched for somatic copy-number changes in tumors., Mapping a complex cancer in multiple dog breeds reveals a polygenic spectrum of germline risk factors pointing to specific pathways as drivers of disease.","","Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive cancer characterized by early metastasis, primary onset in children and adolescents, and high mortality rates (30% to 40%) [1]. Recent work suggests that OS arises when osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal precursors is disrupted by genetic or epigenetic factors [2]. While no structural variants specific to OS have been identified, somatic alterations in tumors are common and often affect suppressor genes RB1, TP53, and the CDK4 inhibitors CDKN2A/B[2]. Germline mutations in RB1 and p53, two genes essential for OS development, can increase disease risk [2–4]. The only genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OS in humans found two significant associations, one genic (GRM4) and the other in a large gene desert, suggesting inherited variation in regulatory elements underlies susceptibility [5]., OS in dogs is a spontaneously occurring disease with a global tumor gene expression signature indistinguishable from human pediatric tumors [6, 7] and, while relative age of onset is higher in dogs, their clinical progression is remarkably similar [8]. Both human and canine OS most commonly arise at the ends of the long bones of the limbs and metastasize readily, usually to the lungs [9]. Unlike human OS, canine OS is a highly heritable disease with some large and giant dog breeds at >10× increased risk, notably greyhounds (mortality from OS = 26%), Rottweilers (17%), and Irish wolfhounds (IWH, 21%) [10–12]. While size and hormonal factors influence risk, variable rates among the larger size breeds suggest breed-specific risk factors [13]. The greyhound American Kennel Club (AKC) registered dogs, a subpopulation that tends to be taller than the racing dogs, has very low rates of OS (G. Couto, unpublished observations)., Mapping disease genes using GWAS in dog breeds, each effectively a genetic isolate only a few hundred years old, requires approximately 10× fewer markers and samples than in human populations [14]. However, population structure, cryptic relatedness, and extensive regions of near fixation in breeds complicate GWAS analysis and to date, few studies have successfully mapped risk factors for complex, multigenic diseases [15]. Here, we use new methods for analyzing breed populations to identify genomic loci associated with OS in the first multibreed association study of a highly polygenic canine disease. We explain the majority of the OS phenotype variance in three high-risk breeds, identify a common regulatory risk factor, and reveal novel genes and pathways underlying this poorly understood disease., Through a parallel multibreed canine association study, we found 33 genomic regions associated with OS, and identified genes and pathways potentially causing this complex, polygenic, and poorly understood disease. Altogether, the 33 loci identified by GWAS account for 50% to 80% of the disease risk within each of these three breeds, demonstrating that inherited factors are the predominant cause. In addition, regions of unusually low variability, reflective of the small effective population sizes and strong artificial selection used to create dog breeds, are also likely to contribute to an overall increased risk for these breeds., None of the OS GWAS loci overlapped between breeds, a strikingly different genetic architecture from the shared variants previously found by mapping Mendelian traits in multiple dog breeds. Potentially this could reflect the difference between: (1) a monogenic trait, where a single variant causes a trait, which, if desirable, is then deliberately bred for; and (2) a complex trait, caused by a random assortment of many low frequency risk factors that rise in frequency through population bottlenecks and selection. This latter scenario is more similar to the genetics in human populations, where many rare risk factors may underlie OS, and may increase in frequency by random drift or moderate natural selection. In dog breeds, tighter bottlenecks and stronger selective forces push risk allele frequencies up, making them easier to detect. Thus, dogs bring added value to the study of OS., The relatively large number of OS associated genes identified in this study facilitated pathway analysis with two different methods. First, the GRAIL software, given only the human genomic regions syntenic to the dog GWAS loci as input (and no information on phenotype) mined the abstracts of all previously published literature and found significant connections between associated genes related to growth, osteoblast differentiation and proliferation, and tumor suppression. Furthermore, a combined gene set enrichment analysis of the associated, fixed, and somatically altered loci identified common pathways affected by inherited and somatically acquired variation, suggesting they may interact to cause tumor initiation and progression. A fraction of the genes and pathways identified have previously been reported to be involved in human OS as either inherited or somatic changes, demonstrating the relevance of the canine model. Potentially more interesting, we also identified novel pathways, including two related to poorly characterized cis-regulatory motifs., The GWAS loci implicated, several of which contain no known genes, show that canine OS has a complex genetic architecture with key advantages over artificially induced mouse models of the human disease. This is well illustrated by our functional analysis of the top greyhound locus. The strong effect of the variant and low genetic diversity of the breed populations allowed us to move rapidly from GWAS region to candidate functional variants with limited additional sequencing and genotyping. The top candidate causal variant is in a non-coding regulatory element upstream of the CDKNA2A/B locus, near, but not overlapping, a region associated with canine histiocytic sarcoma [63]. Pinpointing functional regulatory variants is harder than finding functional coding variation, but such regulatory variation is likely more representative of the genomic variants underlying common human diseases [64]., The CDKNA2A/B locus in dogs is syntenic to the human 9p21 locus, one of the most complex regulatory loci in the human genome [36]. SNPs in this region are significantly and independently associated with diseases including coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, glioma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and breast cancer [64]. Deciphering the cellular mechanisms disrupted by OS associated regulatory variation in dogs may elucidate mechanisms underlying diverse human diseases., We hypothesize that the top canine OS risk variant at chr11:44405676 alters regulation of CDKN2A/ARF. The OS associated variant at dog chr11:44405676 disrupts a highly constrained position in a genomic locus that we show, using a luciferase assay, has strong enhancer activity in a human osteosarcoma cell line. CDKN2A/ARF encodes the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins (including p16INK4a, p15INK4b, and p14ARF). These proteins control G1-progression by inactivation of D-cyclins, inducing senescence via the RB and p53 pathways [65–67]. Altered levels of CDKN2A, a master regulator of tissue development, are linked to hematopoietic stem cell senescence and development, key feature of malignancies including OS [68, 69]. SNPs that disrupt enhancer element binding can change transcriptional activity across the human 9p21 locus, including at CDKN2A[36]. Germline variants affecting regulation of CDKN2A may alter the balance between proliferation and senescence in specific tissues, thereby leading to an increased risk of developing OS and potentially also other cancers in adolescence and adulthood., Canine and human OS are remarkably similar diseases, both clinically [8] and in their tumor gene expression profiles [6, 7]. The recent publication of the first GWAS of osteosarcoma in humans offers a new opportunity to identify common risk factors shared between the two species and thus of particular etiological interest. The human OS GWAS compared 941 patients with osteosarcoma to 3,291 unaffected adults across 699,000 SNPs and found two genome-wide significant loci, one at the glutamate receptor gene GRM4 and the other in a gene desert [5]. The much larger dataset required for GWAS in human patients illustrates the power offered by mapping in genetically isolated dog breed populations. While we see no association in the dog GWAS at the two loci found in the human GWAS, another glutamate receptor gene (GRIK4) is associated with OS in greyhounds. Although glutamate signaling in primary bone cancers is not well understood, both GRM4 and GRIK4 are expressed in normal bone, and glutamate signaling has been shown to regulate bone formation and resorption [70]. Furthermore, inhibition of glutamate receptors limits cell growth in many cell lines., The association of glutamate receptors with OS in both dogs and humans suggests glutamate signaling as a potential therapeutic target, although the diverse physiological functions of this pathway could make this difficult. Glutamatergic signaling is critical for learning and memory [71] and is implicated in a range of neuropsychiatric diseases in both humans [72–74] and dogs [75]. Fixation of variants in glutamate related genes, as seen near GRM4 in Rottweilers (Additional file 1: Figure S9), may suggest that selection on behavioral, as well morphological, traits helped drive OS to the exceptionally high rates seen in the breeds studied here., Detailed characterization of the genetic risk factors involved in initiation and progression of canine OS will give us a comprehensive understanding of the genes involved and the different genetic interactions sufficient to cause the disease. We hypothesize that, by integrating genetic etiology into canine clinical trials, we can identify molecular subtypes of OS and correlate them with treatment efficacy and survival outcomes. In the future, we anticipate that the insights gained from the canine model will help us develop more personalized and effective treatments for human OS."

Thus, it is not a surprise that attendance at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) meeting has grown rapidly over the last few years. Aravinda Chakravarti (Johns Hopkins University, USA), recipient of the William Allan Award, noted that while about 600 people attended the meeting in 1977, this year the attendance was was about ten times more. The immense growth in the field of human genetics was also exemplified by Jeff Murray (University of Iowa, USA) in his presidential address, where he contrasted how the discovery of millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) every day is routine now, whereas the discovery of a single SNP was publication-worthy in 1983., The scope of the meeting was far beyond what can be covered in a short report, so I will focus on two major themes related to medical applicability of whole-genome sequencing data, including understanding the functional impact of variants and the importance of data sharing., Whole-genome sequencing has provided a sea of sequence variants, and we face the challenge of identifying the key disease variants among these. Understanding the functional impact of variants is crucial to eventually home in on the biological mechanisms leading to disease. Multiple sessions in the meeting focused on the functional interpretation of sequence variants. In the session titled ‘Variants, variants everywhere’, a multitude of integrative methods were presented to prioritize variants in disease studies. Haiyuan Yu (Cornell University, USA) showed how a structurally resolved protein interactome can provide novel insights into disease variation. For example, the guilt-by-association principle that interacting proteins tend to be associated with the same disease does not apply to dominant mutations. A likely explanation for this observation is that dominant mutations tend to be gain-of-function and mostly cause the gain of different functions in interacting proteins, as opposed to recessive mutations that tend to be loss-of-function and disrupt the same interaction between two proteins., We have known for a long time that noncoding genomic regions play a big role in human disease. However, the focus of most previous systematic approaches to uncover disease variants has been on coding regions. It was evident during the meeting that we have come a long way in understanding the noncoding part of the genome. I presented our approach called FunSeq, which integrates data from the 1000 Genomes and ENCODE consortia to prioritize noncoding variants in disease studies. Emmanuoil T. Dermitzakis (University of Geneva, Switzerland) and Tuuli Lappalainen (Stanford University, USA) discussed finding causal regulatory variants by combining genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data. To identify causal variants, it is important to know the cell types in which they perturb regulatory processes. Nancy Cox (University of Chicago, USA) described transcriptome studies across multiple tissues and their application to common diseases on behalf of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Cox noted that, based on current results, the most physically proximal or overlapping gene is rarely the most strongly linked gene for trait-associated GTEx eQTLs. John Stamatoyannopoulos (University of Washington, USA) also presented DNase I hypersensitivity data from hundreds of cell/tissue types and developmental states. These talks highlighted the importance of integrating functional genomics studies with whole-genome sequencing data to uncover the effects of sequence variants., When interpreting sequence variants in a functional context, it is important to be cautious as these results can have real-life implications. While discussing mutations that predispose to cancer, Nazneen Rahman (Institute of Cancer Research, UK) rightly reminded us that people make big decisions and have parts of their anatomy removed based on their genotype. In a different vein, Heng Li (Broad Institute, USA) brought to our attention the effects of errors in the reference sequence in next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. Many talks focused on technical details and new methods of variant calling from NGS data. Erik Garrison (Boston College, USA) presented a novel approach that uses a graph reference built from known variants to improve future variant calling. Additionally, Monkol Lek (Massachusetts General Hospital, USA) discussed the advantages and challenges of joint variant calling in a massive set of more than 50,000 exomes., The week of the ASHG meeting overlapped with open access week, befitting one of the major meeting themes: data sharing. A message that was echoed by many speakers was the need to develop new ways of sharing data effectively. Sharing genetic variation data between clinicians and researchers will help advance our understanding of disease and lead to better patient care. Since the number of people getting their whole genomes sequenced is continuously increasing, Nathan Pearson (Ingenuity Systems, USA) presented the Empowered Genome Community, an initiative to help people share their genomes with each other and with scientists through an online genome interpretation application called Ingenuity Variant Analysis., Mendelian diseases were the focus of many discussions involving data sharing. Debbie Nickerson (University of Washington School of Medicine, USA) noted that there are more than 7,500 conditions in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database and approximately 3,500 remain unsolved. These include the very rare conditions where data sharing seems essential, but there is currently no unified database for patients with unsolved Mendelian diseases. Heidi Rehm (Partners Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine, USA) and Ada Hamosh (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, USA) discussed the ‘genomic matchmaker’ collaboration to enable cross-talk between clinical geneticists across the world by creating the broadest source of unsolved exomes and genomes that could be matched with other unsolved cases. Rehm said, ‘There is a critical need in the community to enable groups to collaborate around building evidence for candidate genes for novel genetic disorders. Several groups have developed the capability to match phenotypes and candidate genes from unsolved cases in their systems; however, the success of a match is highly dependent on the wealth of cases from which one can draw.’ In relation to this, many talks referred to Daniel MacArthur’s (Massachusetts General Hospital, USA) collection of exome data from more than 50,000 patients., Another prominent discussion focused on different viewpoints about sharing secondary or incidental findings (results that are unrelated to the reason for the test or the research study but are relevant to the participant’s future health) with patients and research study participants. Anna Middleton (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) discussed international views on sharing incidental findings in research studies, and began her presentation by showing the picture of Sarah, a three year old girl who has an undiagnosed developmental disorder. After sequencing Sarah’s genome, they found some pertinent mutations in genes implicated in developmental disorders, but they also had an incidental finding of a mutation in BRCA1. In an online survey conducted by Middleton and colleagues, the majority of people felt that information about life-threatening, untreatable conditions should be shared. It should be noted that for clinical settings, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommended earlier this year that a set of 57 genes should be evaluated and reported when a patient’s exome or genome sequence is ordered., Perhaps the biggest eureka moment of the meeting was when Jeanne Lawrence (University of Massachusetts Medical School, USA) convincingly showed that her lab was able to silence one entire copy of chromosome 21 in stem cells in vitro. Trisomy 21 or Down’s syndrome is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. Using genome editing with zinc finger nucleases, Lawrence and colleagues inserted XIST (human X-inactivation gene) into chromosome 21 in stem cells with trisomy 21. They then showed using eight different methods that a single copy of the chromosome had indeed been silenced., Thus, the tremendous advances in human genetics are clear. Moving forward into the future, a unifying message of the meeting was the need to integrate data from different resources. In line with this message, the final symposium consisted of Marc Vidal (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA), Aviv Regev (Broad Institute, USA) and Gary Nolan (Stanford University, USA) discussing the marriage between genetics, systems biology and immunology. We heard how single-cell approaches can help tease apart cellular heterogeneity and enable a better understanding of cell biology. Advances in single-cell technologies are expected to greatly help us understand complex processes, such as cancer evolution and heterogeneity in immune response."

Most organisms have some form of circadian regulation, making it one of the most ubiquitous regulatory pathways discovered to date. The core circadian components in mammals include an autoregulatory feedback loop in which the positive factors Clock and Bmal1 (Arntl) dimerize to transactivate expression of negative Per and Cry factors. A secondary loop includes transactivation of genes encoding Ror factors and Rev-Erb that, respectively, activate and repress target genes, including Bmal1. In mammals, the circadian clock is cell-autonomous – each individual cell has a self-sustaining clock. However, only cells in the eye can sense light information, which is conveyed to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) – the master pacemaker in the hypothalamus – through a pathway known as the retinohypothalamic tract. The SCN in turn coordinates clocks in peripheral tissues in order to regulate physiology and behavior [1]. Although the functions and mechanisms of central core clock genes have been studied extensively, their roles in peripheral tissues remain largely unknown. In a recent study, however, Janich et al. begin to fill this gap, as they describe an unexpected function of clock genes in the regulation of human skin differentiation [2]., The skin takes the brunt of damage from the harmful radiation emitted by the sun and is constantly exposed to toxins and abrasive injuries. The outmost layer of the skin, the epidermis, comprises a stratified squamous epithelium that is maintained by proliferating stem and progenitor cells residing in the basal cell layer. These progenitors exit the cell cycle as they enter the suprabasal compartment, where they undergo a series of differentiation steps, ultimately forming the dead cornified layer at the surface of the skin. While the role of the circadian clock in regulation of diurnal changes of physiology through modulation of gene expression in metabolically active organs, such as the liver, fat and muscle, is well known, less is known for epithelial tissues, such as the skin, which primarily perform protective functions. Over 50 years ago, it was observed that cell proliferation in the skin occurs in a circadian manner [3]. However, only recently, by utilizing mice harboring mutations in core clock genes, has the functional significance of this regulation become clear [4–7]. Furthermore, mouse skin is more sensitive at night than during the day to DNA damage and tumorigenesis from ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation; the greater sensitivity to UVB radiation correlates with there being a higher proportion of progenitors in S phase and less efficient excision repair of DNA at night [4, 8]. The evolutionary advantage underlying the circadian clock regulation of cell proliferation in the epidermis remains unclear, but it could relate to improved function of progenitor and stem cells when DNA replication is temporally separated from the maximum generation of reactive oxygen species from oxidative phosphorylation [4]., To investigate the role of the circadian clock in epidermal cells, Janich et al. utilized an in vitro model in which normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), cultured under conditions of low Ca2+, resemble progenitor cells of the basal cell layer. NHEKs were induced to differentiate by increasing the concentration of Ca2+, during which they executed a gene expression program bearing similarity to that of suprabasally located keratinocytes. When synchronizing the clock of cultured NHEKs, the authors discovered unexpected complexity in circadian clock gene expression in these cells [2]. Core circadian genes fell into five phases of peak mRNA levels. These phases, termed A to E, corresponded with peak expression of the genes for the nuclear receptors NR1D1 and NR1D2 (phase A), the period circadian proteins PER1 and PER3 (phase B), the period circadian protein PER2 and the cryptochrome CRY2 (phase C), the cryptochrome CRY1 (phase D) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor BMAL1 (ARNTL) (phase E) (Table 1).Table 1

Each phase is enriched for a unique set of gene ontology (GO) categories. Analysis of the enriched GO categories indicates that peaks A to C, corresponding to late-night to early-morning hours, encompass pathways involved in keratinocyte differentiation, whereas peaks D and E, corresponding to afternoon to evening hours, are pathways involved in DNA replication, UV protection and cell division. Thus, the phases of circadian gene oscillation correlate with different biological and physiological functions, causing differentiation versus DNA replication and repair to occur at distinct circadian times. The work also suggests that the sensitivity of keratinocytes to certain signaling pathways is circadian time dependent., Janich et al. also investigated in detail two major differentiation pathways in keratinocytes, involving Ca2+and transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ). The genes associated with these two categories are enriched in peaks B and C, corresponding to differentiation phases of late night to early morning. The authors found that the gene targets of Ca2+ and TGFβ signaling are most responsive at the time of peaks B or C in synchronized NHEK cells. This difference in sensitivity implies that circadian conditioning of these signal transduction pathways occurs such that the same treatment elicits a greater response at certain times. Perturbation of circadian rhythms by overexpressing the genes encoding PER1 or PER2 or by knocking down CRY1 or CRY2 led to premature differentiation in in vitro assays and colonization defects in orthotopic transplantation studies in mice., Why there should be an evolutionary advantage of initiating the epidermal differentiation program at specific times during the day remains a mystery, especially considering that the transit time of a progenitor cell from the basal cell layer to the surface of the human skin is very long – between 1 and 2 months. The end-product of differentiation – the cornified envelope – persists for a long time. Furthermore, despite abnormalities in cell proliferation dynamics, none of the core clock mutants in mice exhibits obvious barrier or differentiation defects of the interfollicular epidermis. There is some evidence of an age-dependent decrease in skin function in Bmal1 (Arntl) knockout mice [9]. One possibility is that circadian variation in the ability to induce differentiation is secondary to the effect of the circadian clock on cell proliferation, given that only post-mitotic cells normally enter the differentiation program., The report by Janich et al. is an exciting contribution to the growing field of circadian clock studies in epithelial tissues. However, the induction by Ca2+ of differentiation in NHEK cultures is by no means a perfect model of human epidermal differentiation. Furthermore, the synchronization method used in this study – serum shock – can directly synchronize the cell cycle, which is often approximately 24 hours in cultured cells, confounding gene expression changes primarily associated with the cell cycle with those primarily linked to the circadian clock. A better model for circadian control of human epidermal differentiation is primary intact epidermis collected at different times of the day, as utilized in a study by Spörl et al.[10], as well as distinct cell populations from the intact epidermis., In today’s 24-hour society, where sleep deprivation and circadian disruption are the norm, determining the exact role of the circadian rhythm in skin physiology and disease is an important topic for human health. Current work in the field suggests that the circadian clock is an important regulator of epidermal cell proliferation and skin cancer, as well as skin aging, and is a major contributor to chronic wounds in the elderly [8–10]. Thus, we see here another example of the role of circadian clocks in adaptive cellular physiology."

We describe transcriptome-wide approaches to capture the global m5C RNA methylome. We also discuss the potential functions of m5C in RNA and compare them to 6-methyladenosine modifications., Post-transcriptional changes in RNA processing are essential regulators for most, if not all, cellular responses. Although RNA modifications are more prevalent and diverse in their chemical nature than DNA modifications 
[1], our knowledge of their occurrence and function in RNA is generally limited. There are approximately 150 known ribonucleoside modifications: most of them have been found in tRNA and rRNA, but some occur in mRNA 
[1–4]. Post-transcriptional modifications are highly likely to add complexity to RNA-mediated functions., The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools has enabled the identification of RNA modifications both globally and in a substrate-specific manner. 6-Methyladenosine (m6A) was the first modification to be characterized, and is now known to be present in several types of RNA and, most notably, is highly enriched around stop codons in many mRNAs 
[2–4]., Another known modification in RNA is 5-methylcytosine (m5C). Although m5C is a well-characterized modification in DNA, its precise regulatory functions in RNA remain unclear 
[5, 6]. Until recently, the detection of RNA methylation involved the digestion of highly purified RNA followed by separation techniques, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry, which only allowed the identification of m5C in stable and highly abundant tRNAs and rRNAs 
[7–10]. Labeling techniques with 3H in living cells allowed detection of m5C in mRNA and viral RNAs 
[11, 12]. However, the deposition of m5C into mRNA remained controversial 
[13–17]. The recent advances in high-throughput techniques, combined with NGS, have renewed interest in the field, and have led to the identification of m5C as a widespread modification in coding and non-coding (nc)RNAs 
[18]., A fraction of these RNAs were found to be specifically methylated by the RNA methylase NSun2, including mRNAs, ncRNAs and several tRNAs 
[18]. NSun2 had been previously shown to methylate tRNAs at various positions 
[19–22]. Additional NSun2-methylated coding and ncRNAs were identified in two studies published in 2013 that used customized RNA immunoprecipitation approaches followed by NGS 
[23, 24]., The regulatory functions of m5C modifications in RNA are still not fully understood. In tRNAs, in vitro cytosine-5 methylation can affect Mg2+ binding to tRNA molecules, which in turn influences the anticodon stem loop conformation and stabilizes the secondary structure 
[25, 26]. Cytosine-5 methylation alone, or in combination with other nonessential tRNA modifications, can also protect from degradation or cleavage 
[22, 27–29]. In rRNA, m5C is thought to play a role in translation 
[30]. Synthetic cytosine-5 methylated mRNAs exhibit increased stability, and loss of methylation in the 3’ UTR of p16 has been reported to reduce its stability 
[31, 32]., The biological functions of tRNA m5C-methylation are linked to the regulation of protein translation in stress pathways and tissue differentiation in yeast, Drosophila, fish and mouse 
[19, 22, 29, 33–36]. Mutations in the NSUN2 gene in humans cause an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by intellectual disability, skin disorders and growth retardation 
[37–40]. These findings, together with studies carried out in NSun2-deficient mice and cell lines, suggest a wide-ranging role for m5C modifications in RNA, including cellular signaling, tissue development and differentiation, and cancer 
[19, 21, 22, 36, 41–43]., In this review, we compare the current methods to identify m5C in the mammalian transcriptome with a particular focus on NSun2-mediated methylation. We further discuss the potential of these initial studies to comprehensively determine the global but enzyme-specific cytosine-5 RNA methylome. In addition, we compare studies focusing on m6A and m5C modifications and consider the likely benefits of characterizing and elucidating the functions of the mammalian epitranscriptome., Previous methods for detecting m5C in RNA have required exceedingly high amounts of RNA and only reproducibly identified methylated sites in highly abundant RNAs, such as tRNAs and rRNAs. Over the last four years, NGS has allowed researchers to successfully develop more sensitive techniques. Bisulfite sequencing for the detection of m5C in RNA was first described in 2009 
[44]. In 2012, the method was combined with NGS and provided the first transcriptome-wide view of the human cytosine-5 RNA methylome (Figure 
1A) 
[18]. Earlier this year, three independent studies used RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by deep sequencing to detect m5C globally (Figures 
1B-D) 
[23, 24, 45]. Khoddami and Cairns, and our own study 
[24], developed similar but technically distinct approaches to detect enzyme-specific deposition of m5C: 5-azacytidine-mediated RNA immunoprecipitation (Aza-IP) (Figure 
1C) 
[23] and methylation-individual nucleotide resolution crosslinking immmunoprecipitation (miCLIP) (Figure 
1D) 
[24]. Both Aza-IP and miCLIP rely on covalent bond formation between the RNA methylase and substrate but differ in the way in which the stable covalent bond formation is achieved. We now describe these techniques in detail and discuss their specific merits and disadvantages.

The asterisk in (a) indicates bisulfite-mediated conversion of unmethylated cytosines in RNA, and the red box indicates non-conversion due to the presence of cytosine methylation. In Aza-IP, the cytidine analog 5-azacytidine sites are randomly introduced into nascent RNA following cellular exposure to 5-azacytidine, and in miCLIP, the NSun2 protein is engineered to harbor the C271A mutation. Whereas transcriptome-wide bisulfite sequencing does not enrich for methylation targets, m5C-RIP, Aza-IP and miCLIP do so via immunoprecipitation, with Aza-IP and miCLIP utilizing covalently bound protein-RNA complexes. The introduction of a covalent bond between protein and RNA in Aza-IP and miCLIP is dependent on the modified sites introduced into RNA substrates and the NSun2 protein, respectively.
                    , Of the four system-wide techniques that have been used to identify m5C sites in the epitranscriptome (Figure 
1) 
[18, 23, 24, 45], RNA bisulfite sequencing remains the gold standard. This is because it directly detects the enzymatic conversion of cytosines to 5-methylcytosines in RNA. However, RNA bisulfite sequencing has at least three major practical disadvantages: (1) cytosines are resistant to conversion when in double-stranded RNA and several modifications other than m5C inhibit the C to U conversion, leading to false positives 
[53]; (2) the chemical conversion of the nucleotides leads to degradation of the RNA and requires extreme deep sequencing to reveal methylated RNAs of low abundance; and (3) it reveals no information about substrate specificity when, for instance, specific RNA methylases are knocked out. For instance, it cannot distinguish direct from indirect targets or capture the cross-reaction of additional RNA methylases., m5C-RIP, Aza-IP and miCLIP do not rely on chemical base conversion and avoid harsh chemical and thermal conditions that can lead to the degradation of target RNA. They also enrich for RNA substrates during the immunoprecipitation step. Therefore, RNAs with lower abundances can also be captured with standard deep sequencing protocols., A key future goal in the m5C epitranscriptomics field is to gain a methylase-specific view of the mammalian m5C RNA methylome. The m5C-RIP approach has yet to be performed in a mammalian system and, like bisulfite sequencing, analysis of enzyme-specific m5C modification requires genetic deletion or knockdown of the RNA methylase being investigated. Aza-IP and miCLIP not only allow detection of enzyme-specific methylation, but also have the advantage that the covalently bound methylase-RNA complexes can be purified under higher stringency conditions, thus reducing the background of non-specifically bound RNAs., The mechanism of cytosine-5 RNA methylation is highly conserved, and both Aza-IP and miCLIP are applicable, in principle, for most, if not all, m5C RNA methylases. Aza-IP relies on the chemical incorporation of 5-azacytidine into the entire transcriptome prior to isolation of protein-RNA complexes, which may compromise RNA stability and integrity. In addition, the analog will be incorporated into DNA and may alter transcriptional processes. Although Aza-IP was developed using overexpressed NSun2 and Dnmt2 proteins, it can in principle be performed on the endogenous methylases using the appropriate antibodies. In contrast, miCLIP depends on the overexpression of the mutant methylase protein, yet it does not involve any chemical modification of RNA, thus offering a distinct advantage. Since miCLIP only utilizes the last step of the catalytic process, in which the methylated substrate is released from the enzyme, it does not affect the methyl-transfer step, or the endogenous RNA structure, stability and integrity., Particular consideration should also be given to the best bioinformatics approach to analyze different m5C sites. For instance, mapping the methylation sites in tRNAs is particularly challenging because of their abundance and repetitive nature 
[54, 55]. One possibility is to only use uniquely mapping reads, which may result in the omission of methylation sites in particularly repetitive tRNA sequences to allow for more accurate mapping. However, since tRNAs are highly repetitive sequences in the genome, this often leads to discarding a large proportion of the available data. Another strategy is to use uniquely mapping reads to simulate the distribution of reads in a given area, thereby assigning multiple mapping reads proportionally. Mapping m5C sites obtained by bisulfite sequencing is hampered by the bisulfite conversion itself and RNA degradation, which may alter the base content., AzaIP also presents some difficulties for identifying the complete set of methylation sites - a large number of targets often do not contain C to G transversions, and so the methylation sites in those targets are not mapped. Mapping methylation sites in miCLIP, on the other hand, does not depend on such artificial modifications, but rather on the stalling of the reverse transcriptase at the cross-link/methylation site during the reverse transcription step. This phenomenon was utilized to efficiently map methylation sites., While all four methods have their individual drawbacks, together they have the power to reliably detect m5C modifications. We will now turn our attention to comparing the cytosine-5 methylated RNAs that have been identified in the mammalian transcriptome using the different techniques., To better understand the ability of the different techniques to detect m5C, we compared the data produced by the studies focused on the mammalian system 
[18, 23, 24]. Data used for the comparison are available in Additional file 
1. We compared global cytosine-5 methylation sites identified by RNA bisulfite sequencing with NSun2-dependent RNA methylation identified by Aza-IP and our own developed method miCLIP (Figure 
2) 
[18, 23, 24]. Each of the three studies identified m5C sites at nucleotide resolution. RNA bisulfite sequencing enriched for the mRNA fraction, identifying about 10,500 m5C sites 
[18]. The finding that m5C was a common modification in protein coding RNAs is surprising (Figure 
2A) because cytosine-5 methylation has not yet been detected in mRNAs using alternative approaches such as mass spectrometry 
[1]. NSun2-specific Aza-IP 
[23] and miCLIP 
[24] using total RNA determined about 600 and 1,100 sites, respectively, suggesting that less than 10 % of the methylome is directly dependent on NSun2. Most RNAs identified by both Aza-IP and miCLIP corresponded to tRNAs (Figure 
2A), where approximately one-third of the tRNA methylation sites were commonly identified by both methods (Figure 
2B; tRNA). In addition to tRNAs, all three studies identified m5C in non-coding RNAs. While bisulfite sequencing and miCLIP also identified several protein coding RNAs, only one statistically significant protein coding RNA was identified by Aza-IP. Aza-IP also detected additional rRNAs (Figure 
2A). There are ten non-tRNA m5C sites found in at least two of the three studies, so these can be said to be true NSun2 non-tRNA targets with high confidence (Figure 
2C).

                        ) [[18, 23, 24]]. The bisulfite study identifies the global pattern of m5C methylation in the genome, while the AzaIP and miCLIP data shown focus specifically on Nsun2-mediated methylation. (a) Types of transcripts found to be methylated by each technique. (b) Comparison of the genomic locations of individual methylation sites found by each of the three approaches.

(e) Genome browser view of the miCLIP-identified SHF mRNA methylation. Predicted methylation sites are indicated by the black peaks. Note that methylation may occur either in an SHF mRNA intron or within a tRNA, which is transcribed from the same genomic DNA strand. (f) miCLIP data showing identified sites within the CTC1 3′ UTR. The CTC1 3′ UTR contains three tRNA genes predicted to be transcribed from the same genomic DNA strand. The miCLIP predicted methylation sites (black peaks) overlapped specifically with these three regions. (g) An example showing that all miCLIP sequence reads, indicated by purple bars, only extend slightly beyond the annotated tRNA genes. It is most likely that these represent extensions only into the 3′ trailer sequences of tRNAs, and that tRNA rather than mRNA methylation is being detected.
                    , The degree of overlap between the three studies was surprisingly low, and this may be due to several technical differences, as well as the use of different cell lines. Despite this low degree of overlap, the analyses found identical m5C sites in tRNAs and non-tRNAs and confirmed NSun2-dependent methylation sites in several ncRNAs. Our comparison further identified methylated cytosines in mRNAs commonly found in at least two of the three studies. However, we noted that these mRNA methylation sites often shared a genomic location with tRNA genes (see section below). Further optimization of the approaches is clearly required to achieve a comprehensive identification of high-confidence methylation sites., tRNA and tRNA-like sequences are sometimes found embedded within the intronic sequence of an mRNA, or more rarely in its UTR regions. The significance of this is unknown, but in addition to being present in the pre-mRNA/mRNA sequence, it is also possible that these tRNA sequences are independently transcribed into functionally mature tRNAs. Our analysis showed that m5C sites mapping to commonly identified mRNAs can overlap with the genomic location of tRNA genes (Figure 
2D). We determined how often miCLIP-identified mRNA methylation sites overlapped with the presence of tRNA genes. Most miCLIP-identified mRNA m5C sites occurred within exons, fewer within introns and more rarely in 5′ and 3′ UTRs (Figure 
2D). Of those, the vast majority of m5C sites did not coincide with the occurrence of tRNA or tRNA-like sequences, and only five miCLIP-identified mRNAs contained tRNA sequences (Figure 
2D). For example, Aza-IP identified SHF as the only statistically significant mRNA containing an NSun2-dependent m5C site 
[23], and this site was also identified by miCLIP (Figure 
2C) 
[24]. However, the m5C sites occurred in introns of the SHF mRNA and overlap with tRNA sequences (Figure 
2E)., To address the question of whether methylation is taking place in the pre-mRNA/mRNA sequence or an independently transcribed tRNA, we focused on the m5C site within the CTS telomere maintenance complex component 1 (CTC1) mRNA as an example. The CTC1 m5C sites, one of which was also detected by bisulfite sequencing (Figure 
2C), localized to the 3’ UTR of the mRNA (Figure 
2F). We asked whether the miCLIP sequence reads extended further into the mRNA sequence beyond the tRNA regions. If the sequence reads did not extend further into the mRNA sequence, but were confined to the tRNA sequence, it would suggest that we had detected methylation in independently transcribed tRNAs. We found that miCLIP reads usually extended only slightly beyond the annotated tRNA genes (Figure 
2G). Since the annotated tRNA genes do not include 5′ leader or 3′ trailer sequences, it is most likely that these small extensions overlap with tRNA 3′ trailer sequences, which are removed post-transcriptionally. None of the sequence reads extended beyond these tRNA-trailer sequence regions, indicating that these examples represent tRNA methylation rather than methylation of pre-mRNAs/mRNAs., The existence of at least six more putative m5C RNA methylases in mammals may contribute to the general modest overlap between the NSun2- and Dnmt2-specific cytosine-5 methylation sites and the transcriptome-wide methylome 
[18, 23, 24]. The additional enzymes NSun1 and NSun3-7 
[56] are predicted to methylate RNA based on sequence conservation of key catalytic residues. Although the substrate specificities of these enzymes are unknown, NSun1 and NSun5, in addition to NSun2, have been identified as mRNA-binding proteins 
[57]. The biological functions of the NSun protein family is largely unknown, although all of them are expressed during mouse embryogenesis 
[58]. The transcripts of NSun2-7 are enriched in the developing brain, which is consistent with a proposed role in neurocognitive development 
[58]., The limited information we do have about the functional roles of NSun proteins indicates an essential role in a wide range of biological processes and human diseases. NSun1 (also called NOP2 or p120) is a nucleolar protein implicated in rRNA methylation and biogenesis. It has been shown to regulate the cell cycle and is involved in tumorigenesis 
[59–64]. Whether the enzymatic activity of NSun1 is directly required to mediate these cellular processes remains unclear. NSun4 interacts with mitochondrial transcription termination factor 4 (MTERF4) to control mitochondrial ribosomal biogenesis and translation 
[65, 66]. The NSUN5 gene is located in a genomic region deleted in patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disorder 
[67]. Patients with Williams-Beuren syndrome display intellectual disability and developmental delay, as well as craniofacial and cardiovascular abnormalities 
[68]. Whether deletion of NSUN5 directly contributes to these symptoms is unknown. Mutations in the NSUN7 gene cause infertility in mice due to impaired sperm motility 
[69]. Nothing is known regarding the functions of NSun3 and NSun6 proteins., Together, RNA bisulfite sequencing, m5C-RIP, Aza-IP and miCLIP provide powerful tools to determine methylated substrates of all NSun protein family members. This will help to provide a more detailed and informative picture of a methylome-wide m5C landscape., Although there are several types of RNA methylation 
[1], so far, transcriptome-wide approaches determining site-specific RNA methylation have only been performed for m6A and m5C. As already discussed, the m5C modification is most prominently associated with various ncRNAs, but recent studies suggest that it may also be a common modification of mRNAs 
[18, 24]. By contrast, most m6A sites were found in mRNAs and only rarely occurred in ncRNAs, though they were, for instance, found in various long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) 
[4]. In mRNAs, both m6A and m5C modifications are commonly found in coding regions and UTRs rather than in introns 
[4, 24]. Enrichment of m6A sites is most pronounced near stop codons 
[3, 4], whereas m5C is not enriched at stop codons. Both m6A and m5C can occur in 3′ UTRs 
[4, 18], suggesting a potential role in regulating microRNA responses. It is intriguing to speculate that m6A and m5C modifications may cooperate in regulating RNA function and this should be a focus for future studies., A key difference between the m6A and m5C transcriptome-wide studies is that m5C sites in RNA were experimentally determined at the nucleotide resolution, whereas the precise locations of m6A sites have to be computationally predicted 
[3, 4]. The chemistry of bisulfite sequencing makes it unsuitable for the detection of m6A and the lack of understanding of how the m6A modification is catalyzed makes experimental determination at the nucleotide resolution difficult. Identification of m5C sites at nucleotide resolution relies on a covalently bound enzyme-RNA catalytic intermediate, but it is not known whether m6A modification also occurs via the formation of a temporary covalent complex. Thus, the methods available to study m6A and m5C RNA modifications differ technically. The two studies analyzing m6A in the transcriptome used almost identical approaches, resulting in high similarity between two datasets 
[3, 4]. The development of novel techniques to identify RNA m6A sites may be beneficial to identify additional targets not yet detected by the RIP-seq approach. However, it is clear that the currently available techniques detecting m6A and m5C have vastly increased our knowledge regarding RNA methylation and have provided a solid platform for functional studies of these modifications., Despite all the technical advances, further optimization of current methods is required to achieve much closer agreement of the site-specific deposition of m5C, especially in the non-tRNA targets identified by each method. Only then will we have a comprehensive characterization of the global distribution of m5C in RNA that will help to further define the functional roles of this modification., The recently adapted single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technologies for the detection of RNA sequences, together with the successful engineering of novel reverse transcriptases more sensitive to the different RNA modifications occurring in RNAs, may enable the identification of m5C transcriptome-wide without the need of any RNA processing step, not even cDNA conversion, which is usually biased and causes the loss of information about structure and base modifications 
[78, 79]., In summary, the current transcriptome-wide approaches for determining m5C methylation sites are furthering our understanding of this RNA modification in terms of regulatory functions and disease. Indeed, it may not be long before our expectations from understanding RNA m5C modification matches, or even exceeds, that of DNA m5C modification."

Some lncRNAs originate from intragenic enhancers which, when active, behave as alternative promoters producing transcripts that are processed using the canonical signals of their host gene. We have followed up this observation by analyzing intergenic lncRNAs to determine the extent to which they might also originate from intergenic enhancers., We integrated high-resolution maps of transcriptional initiation and transcription to annotate a conservative set of intergenic lncRNAs expressed in mouse erythroblasts. We subclassified intergenic lncRNAs according to chromatin status at transcriptional initiation regions, defined by relative levels of histone H3K4 mono- and trimethylation. These transcripts are almost evenly divided between those arising from enhancer-associated (elncRNA) or promoter-associated (plncRNA) elements. These two classes of 5′ capped and polyadenylated RNA transcripts are indistinguishable with regard to their length, number of exons or transcriptional orientation relative to their closest neighboring gene. Nevertheless, elncRNAs are more tissue-restricted, less highly expressed and less well conserved during evolution. Of considerable interest, we found that expression of elncRNAs, but not plncRNAs, is associated with enhanced expression of neighboring protein-coding genes during erythropoiesis., We have determined globally the sites of initiation of intergenic lncRNAs in erythroid cells, allowing us to distinguish two similarly abundant classes of transcripts. Different correlations between the levels of elncRNAs, plncRNAs and expression of neighboring genes suggest that functional lncRNAs from the two classes may play contrasting roles in regulating the transcript abundance of local or distal loci.","","Eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed [1, 2] with evidence for up to three-quarters of nucleotides in the human genome being expressed in at least one cell type during development [2]. Transcripts lacking an apparent open reading frame are often classified simply based on their length, the absence of protein-coding potential and their location in the genome relative to protein-coding genes [3, 4]. An intriguing class of noncoding transcripts are those exceeding 200 nucleotides in length and transcribed from loci that are intergenic relative to protein-coding genes (intergenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)). At least 50,000 lncRNAs are expressed from intergenic regions of the human genome, more than twice the number of protein-coding genes [5]. Compared to protein-coding transcripts, intergenic lncRNAs are generally less abundant and their expression is more spatially and temporally restricted [4, 6]. Genome-wide analysis of mammalian intergenic lncRNA sequence [7, 8] and transcription [9, 10] has revealed that, in general, these loci have been conserved during evolution, albeit at substantially lower levels than protein-coding genes, suggesting that at least some intergenic lncRNAs may have conserved biological roles. Biological functions attributed to the handful of well-characterized intergenic lncRNAs are diverse, ranging from transcriptional control to post-transcriptional modulation of gene expression (for recent reviews see [11–13])., In this study, for simplicity, we refer to intergenic lncRNAs as those that are transcribed by RNA-polymerase II, 5′ end capped and polyadenylated. Here we address two important, and incompletely answered, questions concerning the origins (transcriptional initiation regions (TIRs)) and classification of intergenic lncRNAs. First, what is the relative prevalence of promoter- and enhancer-associated transcripts within sets of transcripts that are annotated simply as being intergenic lncRNAs? Second, do differences in the chromatin status at intergenic lncRNA TIRs reflect their potential function?, Histone modifications allow the distinction between different types of regulatory elements [14, 15]. Promoters of transcribed protein-coding genes, for example, are enriched in trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) [14, 15]. Some intergenic lncRNA loci have been defined previously using chromatin signatures that are similar to those often found at protein-coding genes, namely H3K4me3 marked promoters and trimethylation of lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me3) across transcribed regions [16]. These findings demonstrate that some intergenic lncRNAs are transcribed from promoter-like elements., A second class of transcripts could be prevalent in current catalogues of intergenic lncRNAs, namely enhancer-associated noncoding RNAs (eRNAs) [17]. Transcription is a common feature of active mammalian enhancers and can give rise to both non-polyadenylated, bidirectional, unstable transcripts [17] as well as unidirectionally transcribed, polyadenylated, relatively stable and sometimes spliced eRNAs [18, 19]. We have previously shown that activation of enhancers located within protein-coding genes promotes transcription of long noncoding RNAs that utilize splicing and polyadenylation signals from their protein-coding hosts to produce stable unidirectional eRNAs [20]. On the other hand, the expression of intergenic lncRNA loci has been associated with enhanced levels of their neighboring protein-coding genes, both through genome-wide [10, 21, 22] and locus-specific analyses [22, 23], suggesting that a large, yet undetermined, fraction of transcripts within lncRNA catalogues are unidirectional eRNAs, as previously proposed by Natoli and Andrau [24]. These observations motivated us to expand on our earlier observations [10, 20] to determine to what extent intergenic lncRNAs might originate from active intergenic enhancers., To address this question we generated new genome-wide maps of H3K4me3 and monomethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively), deep poly(A) + RNA sequencing and nanoCAGE [25, 26] data from purified mouse erythroblasts. Using these data, we annotated a stringent set of intergenic lncRNAs expressed in these cells and accurately defined their transcriptional start sites using these newly acquired nanoCAGE data. We used the relative abundance of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at these intergenic lncRNAs’ TIRs, a well-established and widely used approach to differentiate between promoter and enhancer-like regulatory elements [27], to distinguish unidirectional eRNAs (here called elncRNAs) from promoter-associated lncRNAs (or plncRNAs). Our analyses demonstrate that chromatin marks at their TIRs effectively separate two equally prevalent classes of intergenic lncRNAs. These classes differ with respect to their evolution, tissue-specificity, levels of expression and co-expression levels with their neighboring genes, suggesting that, if they influence gene expression, they may do so in different ways., We recently found that that some intragenic lncRNAs originate from active enhancers lying within protein-coding genes [20]. These unidirectional intragenic lncRNAs (named meRNAs) use the splicing and polyadenylation signals of the protein-coding hosts [20] to produce stable, polyadenylated lncRNAs. Like their intragenic counterparts, intergenic enhancers are also known to be associated with the transcription of both bidirectional as well as unidirectional noncoding RNA transcripts [17–19]. The earlier reports on the association between intergenic lncRNA expression and enhanced levels of neighboring protein-coding genes [10, 21, 22, 45] together with this finding led us to hypothesize that a relatively high, yet undetermined, proportion of intergenic lncRNAs may similarly originate from active intergenic enhancers., Here we stringently annotated a set of intergenic lncRNAs and, using recent nanoCAGE technology, accurately identified their transcriptional start sites. This enabled us to subclassify these lncRNAs as arising from promoters (plncRNAs, enriched for H3K4me3 over H3K4me1) or enhancers (elncRNAs, enriched for H3K4me1 over H3K4me3) based on the chromatin signatures of their TIRs. Unexpectedly, we found that approximately half of these intergenic lncRNAs are transcribed from enhancers rather than promoters. Importantly, it is the ratio between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 chromatin marks that distinguishes enhancer- from promoter-like sequences: most TIRs have both chromatin marks (Figure 1) and three-quarters of the TIRs associated with the intergenic enhancers studied here were (to some extent) modified by H3K4me3. We propose that to subclassify intergenic lncRNAs in combination with high resolution maps of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, the data derived from the same sample that are required to accurately distinguish between these two classes of lncRNAs are (i) high depth poly(A)-selected RNA sequencing, which is needed to faithfully build long transcript models, (ii) nanoCAGE sequencing, which is required to accurately define the 5′ ends of transcripts, and (iii) DNase 1 hypersensitive site sequencing, which allows the identification of regions of open chromatin that often harbor functional cis-elements., Our studies show that plncRNAs and elncRNAs differ substantially in several properties, a distinction that should now facilitate the design of targeted experiments seeking a mechanistic understanding of the biological role of lncRNA transcription, a key question in the field. Despite their different origins, plncRNAs and elncRNAs differ substantially in their levels and tissue or cell expression profiles and in their sequence conservation during evolution. However, they are indistinguishable in terms of their lengths or their numbers of exons or their transcriptional directionality. Previous work has shown that expression of intergenic lncRNAs in general is associated with enhanced expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes, both through genome-wide [10, 21, 22] and locus-specific analyses [22, 23]. Here we show that this is a feature specific to elncRNAs and not plncRNAs., The clear difference in the selective pressures that have acted on elncRNA and plncRNA TIRs or loci suggests that, if functional, transcription (or transcripts) of the two classes of lncRNAs may have distinct roles. Importantly, the neutral, or near-neutral, evolution of elncRNAs and the evidence of constraint found for plncRNAs imply that the two lncRNA classes are distinct: a locus will rarely be an elncRNA in one tissue and a plncRNA in another. Enhancer-like lncRNA TIRs and sequences are poorly conserved during mammalian evolution, which is entirely consistent with previous reports of rapid turnover of DNA sequence at enhancers during evolution [47, 48]. This might suggest that similarly to their intragenic counterparts [20], promoter directionality of intergenic elncRNAs may derive from cis-acting signals found in their genomic vicinity and does not reflect global preservation of functional motifs within elncRNA transcripts. The distributions of splice sites and polyadenylation signals around a transcription start site have recently been shown to be important in determining the directionality and stability of extended RNA transcripts [49]. Due to the relatively small number of lncRNAs annotated in this experiment, our data are insufficient to address this issue for erythroblast lncRNA loci., By contrast, plncRNA promoters and the associated exons in their processed RNAs appear to have evolved under selective constraint, accumulating significantly fewer substitutions than neutral sequence, a signature of potential function. Constraint on plncRNA transcribed sequence occurs predominantly in the exons, indicating that it is the mature, spliced form, rather than the precursor molecule (or more simply the act of transcription) that mediates any plncRNA function. It should be borne in mind that plncRNA constraint is modest, only approximately 20% or approximately 5% of deleterious substitutions are predicted to have been purged from their TIRs or exons, respectively. The latter constraint suggests that either a small fraction of plncRNAs or a relatively small portion of their sequence has conserved (potentially functional) roles [4, 6–8]., In summary, we have shown that the regulatory elements at the origin of intergenic lncRNAs, defined based on chromatin status, allow the distinction between two classes of transcripts that may have different biological functions. This categorization of previously indistinguishable lncRNAs will allow more specific genome-wide investigation of their properties, accelerating our understanding of their potential biological roles and the molecular mechanisms by which they operate."

It contains a recently diverged freshwater clade, which offers the opportunity to compare adaptations to salt- and freshwaters in a monophyletic bacterial group. However, there are no cultivated members of the freshwater SAR11 group and no genomes have been sequenced yet., We isolated ten single SAR11 cells from three freshwater lakes and sequenced and assembled their genomes. A phylogeny based on 57 proteins indicates that the cells are organized into distinct microclusters. We show that the freshwater genomes have evolved primarily by the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions and that they have among the lowest ratio of recombination to mutation estimated for bacteria. In contrast, members of the marine SAR11 clade have one of the highest ratios. Additional metagenome reads from six lakes confirm low recombination frequencies for the genome overall and reveal lake-specific variations in microcluster abundances. We identify hypervariable regions with gene contents broadly similar to those in the hypervariable regions of the marine isolates, containing genes putatively coding for cell surface molecules., We conclude that recombination rates differ dramatically in phylogenetic sister groups of the SAR11 clade adapted to freshwater and marine ecosystems. The results suggest that the transition from marine to freshwater systems has purged diversity and resulted in reduced opportunities for recombination with divergent members of the clade. The low recombination frequencies of the LD12 clade resemble the low genetic divergence of host-restricted pathogens that have recently shifted to a new host.","","Microbial genomes change in gene content by duplications, deletions and horizontal gene transfers, and in sequence by nucleotide substitutions and homologous recombination. The relative contribution of recombination to sequence divergence has been determined in a wide range of microorganisms [1]. Much of the results have been inferred from the analyses of rRNA genes and protein-coding genes used for multilocus sequence typing. Comparisons of such data between species have shown that the ratio at which a nucleotide becomes substituted as a result of recombination versus mutations (r/m) ranges from very low (<1) to extremely high (>10) [1]. Because of these differences, some bacterial populations can be sorted into discrete subclusters, whereas others are best described as a continuum of sequence variants., Bacteria with a clonal population structure, low levels of genetic diversity and low r/m ratios tend to be host-adapted. They have often experienced a population bottleneck associated with the adaptation to a single host and are referred to as ‘genetically monomorphic species’ [2]. On the other extreme are environmental bacteria, such as the SAR11 group of Alphaproteobacteria, which can make up to 30% of the total marine bacterioplankton in the upper surface waters of the oceans [3, 4]. The r/m ratio for SAR11 isolates has been estimated to 63 [1, 5], which is one of the highest r/m ratios recorded for bacteria., It has been hypothesized that a high recombination frequency in the marine SAR11 bacteria is the result of selection to ensure variability in the phage receptor protein sequences [1, 5]. Indeed, highly abundant SAR11-specific pelagiphages were recently identified in the oceans [6] and the presence of hypervariable regions (HVRs) in the marine SAR11 genomes that code for the biogenesis of outer membrane components [7] provides indirect support for co-evolutionary interactions with pelagiphages. The SAR11 bacteria are characterized by having very small genome sizes, in the 1.4 to 1.6 Mb range, and extremely small cell volumes, which is suggested to result from selection to enhance the surface to volume ratio [7–9]., The SAR11 group of aquatic bacteria contains a freshwater clade that has diverged relatively recently from the marine groups [7]. The freshwater clade of the SAR11 group [10–12] was first identified in an Arctic Toolik lake, and is referred to as LD12 [13, 14]. Based on ribosomal RNA phylogenies, LD12 is currently classified as subtype IIIb of the SAR11 clade [7]. Isotope trace studies have provided some information on organic substrate use [15] and single cell surveys indicate that LD12 constitutes 1% to 21% of freshwater bacterioplankton [15]. The transition from marine to freshwater ecosystems was a unique event, which is thought to have happened only once in the evolutionary history of the SAR11 clade [12, 16]. Because of their close relatedness, freshwater and saltwater SAR11 lineages enable comparative studies of the population dynamics of bacteria that have shifted their ecological niche from the open oceans to physically constrained lake ecosystems. However, such studies have been hampered because there are no cultivation methods available for LD12, and thus, no genomes have yet been sequenced., Single cell genomics is emerging as a new method to study the genomes of uncultivated microorganisms [17, 18]. Here, we report a comparative analysis of ten single-cell genomes from LD12 along with recruited metagenome reads from six lakes. The results indicate that the transition to freshwater has been associated with dramatic changes in the population dynamics of the SAR11 group of bacteria., We have shown in this study that the relative contribution of recombination to the observed substitutions in fresh and saltwater bacteria of the SAR11 clade differs by more than two orders of magnitude. These results are remarkable in that the r/m ratio for the freshwater genomes is in the lower range of such estimates for bacteria, whereas the saltwater genomes represent the upper end of the spectrum [1]. This implies that specialization to freshwater ecosystems has had a dramatic effect on the population dynamics of the SAR11 group of bacteria, much like the reduction in genetic diversity observed for human pathogen specialists."

John Mattick (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Australia) unraveled a new form of four-dimensional organization of the genome in which alternatively spliced, but not constitutive, exons are preorganized around active promoters and enhancers. Antonio Giraldez (Yale University, USA) combined genome-wide ribosome profiling with mass spectrometry in zebrafish to identify more than 800 micropeptides that are translated from ncRNAs, conserved in vertebrates and expressed mostly in early development, and that are important for gastrulation and heart development. In addition, Igor Ulitsky (Weizmann Institute, Israel) found common features between the open reading frames (ORFs) in the 5’UTR of ribosome-associated long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and inefficiently translated mRNAs, which could explain the untranslatable nature of lincRNAs., MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 21 nucleotides in length) regulatory RNAs that control gene expression by either inhibiting protein translation or inducing mRNA decay by imperfectly base-pairing to 3’UTRs of target mRNAs. The biogenesis of miRNAs is under tight temporal and spatial regulation, and misregulation of these processes is often associated with disease. Narry Kim (Institute for Basic Science and Seoul National University, Korea) showed that during early development in flies, most mature miRNAs lose a 3’ adenyl tail important for miRNA stability, and suggested that this could be implicated in the maternal-to-zygote transition. Eran Hornstein (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) ameliorated the neuromuscular deterioration of a classic mouse model of amyotrofic lateral sclerosis by recovering pre-miRNA processing via a small molecule that potentiates Dicer activity. In addition, Elisa Izaurralde (Max Planck Institute for Development Biology, Germany) showed that the enrichment of tryptophan residues along the interacting pockets of GW182 with miRNA-loaded Argonaute and RNA decapping and deadenylase complexes is essential for the miRNA-mediated translational repression of mRNAs. Finally, David Bartel (HHMI/MIT/Whitehead Institute, USA) showed that in early zebrafish development, miRNAs inhibit protein translation by shortening the mRNA polyA tail rather than inducing degradation of the transcript, a mechanism that is predominant later in development., Regarding other small RNAs (sRNAs), it is well established in plants and invertebrates that RNA interference (RNAi)-dependent silencing pathways regulate various processes, including regulation of gene expression, protection of genome integrity and innate immune responses against viruses. Olivier Voinnet (ETH Zurich, Switzerland) showed that in mammalian stem cells, antiviral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are also generated for defense against pathogens. In the animal germline, however, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are in charge of silencing mutagenic transposable elements. Eva-Maria Weick (The Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute, UK) demonstrated that there are different mechanisms of piRNA biogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans depending on environmental conditions, with the synthesis of a novel population of type 2 piRNAs under stress. Maike Laussmann (EMBL Heidelberg, Germany) showed by live cell imaging that key proteins in the piRNA pathway are highly dynamic and present different retention times in the cytoplasm granules (also known as nuages) in vivo, suggesting different functions in piRNA biogenesis., Since the discovery of Xist and HOTAIR, thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified and classified depending on their genomic location, whether they are intra- or intergenic, and according to their strand-specificity. lncRNAs have been increasingly shown to be involved in a wide range of regulatory functions, from the regulation of transcription to splicing, and in tethering chromatin-modifying complexes to DNA. One of the best-studied examples is Xist, which is essential for X chromosome inactivation. Jeannie Lee (Massachusetts General Hospital, USA) showed that Xist-mediated recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) during X inactivation is non-random with highly localized spreading along gene-rich domains first, whereas during maintenance all regions are covered at once, suggesting the existence of an epigenetic memory. Edith Heard (Institut Curie, France) presented the kinetics of X inactivation showing that Xist coating and loss of euchromatin marks precede jumonji, AT rich interactive domain 2 (JARID2)-dependent recruitment of PRC2 for gene silencing. Roberto Bonasio (HHMI/NYU School of Medicine, USA) confirmed a lncRNA-dependent interaction and combined recruitment of JARID2 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Drosophila) (EZH2) to target genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Maite Huarte (CIMA/University of Navarra, Spain) described a novel and conserved nuclear lincRNA, PINT (p53-induced noncoding transcript), that is downregulated in tumor cells and induced by the tumor suppressor p53. Huarte demonstrated that PINT is important for cell proliferation and survival via direct recruitment of PRC2 to pro-apoptotic genes. Howard Chang (Stanford University, USA) introduced an innovative genome-wide technique for analyzing chromatin accessibility by in vitro random insertion of a known transposon sequence into preferentially open chromatin, allowing posterior detection of the integration sites by deep sequencing (assay of transposase accessible chromatin deep sequencing (ATAC-seq)). Finally, John Rinn (Harvard University, USA) introduced the novel X-related lincFIRRE, involved in proximal approximation of nuclear territories. Rinn showed that 6 of the 18 lncRNA knockout strains they had generated exhibit distinct developmental or lethality phenotypes, highlighting the physiological relevance of lncRNAs., The first circular RNA (circRNA) was discovered in 1978 from a viroid particle. Since then, many circRNAs have been described in eukaryotes and mammals and several functions have been identified related with this novel class of RNA. Using genome-wide analyses, Nikolaus Rajewsky (Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Germany) identified thousands of new circRNAs in human cells, which represent 1% of total RNA. Most of these circRNAs are generated from exonic sequences, are conserved, and are more stable than linear RNAs. The study of 50 of those circRNAs indicated that many are developmentally regulated, and present many miRNA binding sites, suggesting a role as miRNA sponges. Thomas Hansen (Aarhus University, Denmark) delved deeper into circRNA regulation by identifying CiRS-7, which is conserved and highly expressed in the brain and is highly conserved. CiRS-7 inhibits miR-7 function by sequestering the miRNA, and can be repressed selectively by miR-671. Marc Buhler (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Switzerland) pointed out that ncRNAs not only act as attractants and guides, but also as evictors of chromatin modifiers. Such as in the case of borderline RNA, a new class of ncRNA that is expressed at insulators to repress the spreading of heterochromatin by evicting Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Finally, Ling-Ling Chen (Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences, China) discovered two new classes of polyA(-) excised intron-derived lncRNAs, including linear small nucleolar (sno)-lncRNAs, which are flanked by snoRNA ends, and circular intronic long noncoding RNAs (ciRNAs), which are derived from inefficient debranching after splicing. A sno-lncRNA linked to Prader-Willi syndrome acts as a splicing factor molecular sponge that alters RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog 2 (FOX2)-dependent alternative splicing. The nuclear ciRNA ci-ankrd52 acts as a positive regulator of transcription, suggesting that unknown types of ncRNAs with novel functions are yet to be discovered., An increasing characterization of the many ncRNAs expressed in bacteria, and other prokaryotes, is highlighting the diversity and unsuspected new roles of these RNAs in genome regulation. Gisela Storz (NIHCD-NIH, USA) has identified small ncRNAs in bacteria that act as transcriptional regulators important for adaptation and survival to host environments. Jennifer Doudna (University of California, USA) introduced an RNA-dependent defense system against foreign nucleic acids based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), which are widely used in bacteria and archaea as an immune system. Conversely, John van der Oost (Wageningen University, The Netherlands) presented a new defensive role for prokaryotic Argonaute, which uses small single-stranded DNA guides complementary to invasive plasmids for cleavage and degradation. Finally, Jorg Vogel (University of Wurzburg, Germany) described an innovative system to investigate the interplay between a pathogen, Salmonella, and its host cell during infection by dual high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of both pathogen and host at the same time. They discovered a new small RNA, STnc440, expressed in Salmonella, that is important for regulating the pathogen’s virulence and its rate of replication for a more efficient infection., The non-coding genome is intimately related to the coding genome, and a better understanding of this relationship will shed light on important regulatory mechanisms in development, cell commitment and disease. It seems there is a whole universe out there waiting to be discovered."

The absence of a tight regulatory network for transcription in the human malaria parasite suggests that gene expression may largely be controlled at post-transcriptional and translational levels., In this study, we compare steady-state mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA levels of Plasmodium falciparum at different time points during its asexual cell cycle. For more than 30% of its genes, we observe a delay in peak transcript abundance in the polysomal fraction as compared to the steady-state mRNA fraction, suggestive of strong translational control. Our data show that key regulatory mechanisms could include inhibitory activity of upstream open reading frames and translational repression of the major virulence gene family by intronic transcripts. In addition, we observe polysomal mRNA-specific alternative splicing events and widespread transcription of non-coding transcripts., These different layers of translational regulation are likely to contribute to a complex network that controls gene expression in this eukaryotic pathogen. Disrupting the mechanisms involved in such translational control could provide novel anti-malarial strategies.","","Malaria is still one of the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide, claiming an estimated 660,000 lives per year [1]. The vast majority of deaths occur among children under the age of 5 years living in sub-Saharan Africa [1]. Over the past decade, malaria control measures have reduced the global incidence and mortality rates by 17% and 26%, respectively [1]. However, the absence of a preventive vaccine and the spread of drug-resistant parasite strains warrant continued investigations into the intricate biology of the malaria parasite, in search of novel anti-malarial drug targets., The malaria parasite species Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for 90% of all malaria deaths [1]. The complex life cycle of P. falciparum involves multiple stages in both the human and the mosquito host. The symptomatic phase of P. falciparum infection is the erythrocytic stage, where the parasite replicates in red blood cells and progresses through the ring, trophozoite and schizont stages to produce 16 to 32 daughter cells. The release of these daughter cells, or merozoites, into the blood stream after the completion of each 48-hour cycle of cell division causes the typical pattern of recurring fevers. Environmental stress, such as low nutrient levels, induces the formation of gametocytes, the sexual forms of P. falciparum, which can be transferred to a mosquito host when it takes a blood meal., The multiplication process during the erythrocytic cell cycle of P. falciparum infection is tightly regulated and involves the expression of the majority of its genes [2–4]. However, the regulation of gene expression in P. falciparum is still incompletely understood. Relatively few transcription factors have been identified [5, 6], while changes in chromatin structure seem to play a unique role in transcriptional control [7, 8]. Moreover, for a large proportion of genes expressed in the erythrocytic cycle, transcriptional activity does not correlate well with protein abundance [9, 10], similar to mammalian cells where the initiation of translation, and not transcript abundance, is the main determinant of protein levels [11]. In Plasmodium berghei gametocytes, delayed translation of two transcripts was shown to occur by temporary storage of these transcripts in P-bodies, followed by transfer to ribosomes after ingestion of gametocytes by a mosquito [12]. RNA-binding proteins are likely to be involved in translational repression at this stage [13]. In addition, latency of P. berghei sporozoites is controlled by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α, resulting in inhibition of translation [14]. However, the mechanisms and the extent of post-transcriptional and translational control have not yet been described for the asexual stage of P. falciparum., In other eukaryotic organisms, a multitude of mechanisms act in concert to regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, including mRNA splicing, decay, binding of inhibitory proteins and the actions of regulatory mRNA elements. One of the major regulatory mechanisms of mRNA abundance in higher eukaryotes is RNA interference, but homologues of the RNA interference machinery have not been identified in the P. falciparum genome [15]., In this study, we performed next-generation sequencing of both steady-state mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA, presumed to be actively translated. Our genome-wide approach allowed us to elucidate the extent of translational control during the erythrocytic cell cycle of P. falciparum and to identify key mechanisms likely contributing to the complex regulatory network of gene expression and parasite virulence. Collectively, our results increase our understanding of parasite development throughout the infectious cell cycle, which may contribute to novel antimalarial strategies., In this study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of mechanisms that control gene expression at the translational level during the asexual cell cycle of P. falciparum by comparing next-generation sequencing data from steady-state mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA. We determined that more than 50% of genes expressed during the asexual cycle of the malaria parasite exhibit some form of translational control, ranging from a partial shift in translation levels as compared to transcriptional activity, to a delay in translation of 18 hours or more. The results from this genome-wide analysis confirm and extend previous findings from smaller scale comparisons of the P. falciparum transcriptome and proteome [9, 10]. In comparison with other eukaryotic genomes, P. falciparum encodes relatively few transcription-associated proteins, while it was found to be enriched for proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, translation rates and mRNA stability [6]., Based on these observations, we propose a gene expression model for P. falciparum in which the absence of a tight regulatory network for transcription is compensated by post-transcriptional and translational control mechanisms, resulting in a just-in-time translation of proteins. In particular, the parasite seems to have developed a mechanism of delayed translation for proteins that are needed early in the cell cycle, many of which play important roles in erythrocyte remodeling and metabolism. By retaining these transcripts until after re-invasion, the parasite can quickly translate proteins that are critical for its establishment inside the erythrocyte, before it starts a new round of massive transcription and replication. Translational repression by temporary storage of two transcripts in ribonucleoprotein particles has previously been described for the gametocyte stage [12]. The presence of the DDX-6 class RNA helicase DOZI is essential for the formation of these complexes. This protein was recently shown to be present in granular bodies in the cytoplasm of asexual parasites [43], and it is tempting to speculate that DOZI may also be involved in storage of transcripts during the asexual cell cycle., The wealth of information obtained from RNA-Seq experiments allowed us to subsequently perform an in-depth comparison between these two mRNA subpopulations. We identified major differences in mRNA landscape between steady-state mRNA and polysomal mRNA, which provide important clues for potential regulatory mechanisms. Compared to other eukaryotes, P. falciparum genes contain relatively long 5′ UTRs [44]. Recently, the 5′ UTR of the household gene phosphoglucomutase-2 (PGM2; PFD0660w) was shown to play an important role in translation efficiency [45]. In addition, the length and sequence context of the uORF of P. falciparum var gene variant var2csa was demonstrated to influence the balance between translational repression and translation initiation at the main coding sequence after uORF translation [46]. In line with knowledge from other well-studied eukaryotic organisms [20, 22, 23, 47], uORFs in the 5′ mRNA leaders of P. falciparum transcripts are likely to be important regulatory elements that control the level and timing of translation of the main coding sequence. The translation of uORFs by itself does not necessarily influence translation of downstream coding sequences, since the ribosome can continue scanning the mRNA and re-initiate translation at a downstream AUG [20, 48, 49]. However, the association we observed between uORF translation, translational delay and uORF length suggests that the main inhibitory mechanism of uORFs in P. falciparum entails the prevention of ribosomes from reaching the main ORF, possibly by activation of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway [25–27]. Alternatively, many uORFs in the high A/T-biased P. falciparum genome contain poly-A tracts that encode lysine repeats, which may significantly slow down the translating ribosome [50]. Furthermore, it is known that uORFs can code for functional peptides that can even exert translational control by themselves [51]. Future studies will have to elucidate the exact nature of these uORFs and their impact on translation., Another interesting feature of translation that had not been previously described in P. falciparum is stop codon readthrough. A recent in-depth study in Drosophila classified about 2% of all genes as stop codon readthrough candidates [32], indicating that this may be a relatively common event in eukaryotes. Although further studies will need to validate the occurrence of stop codon readthrough at similar levels in P. falciparum, this process could possibly explain the unexpected large size of at least one protein. Phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary constraints on 3′ UTRs and computational methods for the identification of coding regions could shed more light on this mechanism, although currently available tools may have to be adapted for the highly A/T-rich genome of P. falciparum. In this respect, it is also interesting to mention that relatively long 3′ UTRs, as frequently observed in P. falciparum transcripts, may also harbor binding sites for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that could influence translation efficiency, similar to what is observed in mammalian neuronal tissues [52]., We detected novel alternative splice variants in the asexual cell cycle of P. falciparum, thereby expanding the number of alternative splice variants that are currently annotated or have previously been described in multiple independent RNA-Seq datasets from the same stages [4, 18, 53]. In addition, we also observed that a large proportion of genes contained sequence reads that mapped to introns. Since the majority of introns were completely devoid of reads, this is unlikely to be caused by DNA contamination of our mRNA samples. Intron coverage can be the result of intron retention in the transcript, or the transcription of overlapping RNAs, either in a sense or anti-sense direction, as is known to occur in P. falciparum[53, 54]. Alternatively, introns are known to contain many non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [55], that can be independent transcripts or be derived from the pre-mRNA. While a number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), RNAs of unknown function (RUFs) and other ncRNAs encoded by intronic regions have previously been described for the P. falciparum genome [56, 57], the widespread detection of intronic coverage is suggestive of a much larger number of regulatory RNAs encoded by introns. In addition, the preferential association of some intronic transcripts with polysomal fractions may point to functions in translational regulation. The apparent role of intron-encoded transcripts in translational repression of the var genes demonstrates the potent regulatory function of such RNAs, although the exact mechanism of control remains to be determined. The lack of coverage in the exons suggests that the intronic transcript involved in translational repression is distinct from the two var intronic ncRNAs that have previously been described and that either partially overlapped exon 1 or completely overlapped exon 2 [42]. Instead, it may suggest that the intron itself is retained and functional after splicing. Given the purity of our polysome fractions (<2.0% protein contamination), it is unlikely that intronic transcripts were obtained by co-purification of other protein-RNA complexes. Furthermore, even though ribosomes are known to be sticky complexes, the high yield of intronic transcripts in polysomal fractions for virtually all var gene variants at the ring stage suggests that this is not the result of mere non-specific adherence, but of specific targeting of intronic var transcripts to ribosomes. A better understanding of the role of intronic transcripts or intron-encoded peptides in translational repression of the var genes would contribute to strategies for disrupting the mutually exclusive var gene expression, thus preventing escape of the parasite from adaptive immune responses., Collectively, this study has shown that the regulation of translation in P. falciparum is a multi-faceted process of high complexity. Several control mechanisms that have previously been described in higher eukaryotes are also likely to be active in the malaria parasite, including translational repression by upstream ORFs, widespread transcription of non-coding transcripts, and alternative splicing events. This study clearly demonstrates that steady-state mRNA levels are often not predictive for translational activity and that translated transcript variants may differ from the general mRNA population, as recently also shown for human cells [58], indicating that the compartment of actively translated transcripts should not be overlooked. A detailed understanding of the regulatory network that determines gene expression in the different stages of the P. falciparum life cycle will not only increase our knowledge of parasite biology, but may ultimately result in the identification of novel antimalarial drug targets."

Chl. chlorochromatii has acquired relatively few symbiosis-specific genes; most acquired genes are predicted to modify the cell wall or function in cell-cell adhesion. In striking contrast, âCa. S. mobilisâ appears to have undergone massive gene loss, is probably no longer capable of independent growth, and thus may only reproduce when consortia divide. A detailed model for the energetic and metabolic bases of the dependency of âCa. S. mobilisâ on Chl. chlorochromatii is described., Genomic analyses suggest that three types of interactions lead to a highly sophisticated relationship between these two organisms. Firstly, extensive metabolic exchange, involving carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur sources as well as vitamins, occurs from the epibiont to the central bacterium. Secondly, âCa. S. mobilisâ can sense and move towards light and sulfide, resources that only directly benefit the epibiont. Thirdly, electron cycling mechanisms, particularly those mediated by quinones and potentially involving shared protonmotive force, could provide an important basis for energy exchange in this and other symbiotic relationships.","","Symbiotic interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes are common and can be mutualistic (for example, between nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium spp. and legumes [1] or between sulfur-oxidizing Gamma- or Epsilonbacteria and marine invertebrates [2]) or parasitic (for example, bacterial pathogens and human hosts). Archaea and eukaryotes also form symbioses, which include the methanogens of arthropod, ruminant, and human digestive systems as well as the archaeal symbionts of sponges [3]. Symbioses involving only bacterial and/or archaeal partners are also known and may be more widespread than commonly recognized [4]. Mutualistic interactions involving nutrient exchange, waste removal, and stress protection are probably crucial to the maintenance of microbial biofilm communities and are well documented in syntrophic interactions involving hydrogen or formate transfer [5]. Other examples include chlorophototrophic mat communities of hot springs [6] and anaerobic methane-oxidizing communities of marine environments [7]., The term âconsortiumâ originally described a close association of microbial cells in which two or more different microorganisms maintained an organized structure through permanent cell-to-cell contact [8]. Phototrophic consortia were first reported more than 100 years ago [9], and they may represent the highest degree of mutual interdependence between two unrelated bacteria not associated with a eukaryotic host [4, 10â12]. Ten morphologically distinct types are known, and most are barrel-shaped, motile aggregates comprising two cell types: a central bacterium, which is a single, non-pigmented, and heterotrophic cell carrying a single polar flagellum; and approximately 15 to >40 epibionts, which are green- or brown-colored green sulfur bacteria (GSB) [10â12] (Figure 1; Figure S1 in Additional file 1). These consortia are motile and exhibit scotophobotaxis (âfear of the darkâ) as well as positive chemotaxis to sulfide, thiosulfate, 2-oxoglutarate and citrate [13].

                    , Because of the availability of an enrichment culture isolated from Lake Dagow, Germany, âChlorochromatium aggregatumâ is the best-characterized phototrophic consortium [13]. The epibiont of âChlorochromatium aggregatumâ, Chlorobium (Chl.) chlorochromatii strain CaD3, is not obligately symbiotic. It has been isolated and grown axenically, and physiological characterization showed that Chl. chlorochromatii is similar to other free-living GSB isolates [14]. It is a non-motile, obligately anaerobic, photolithoautotrophic GSB that uses sulfide as the electron donor for photosynthetic CO2 and N2 fixation. The genome of Chl. chlorochromatii has been sequenced, and this enabled previous biochemical, transcriptomic and proteomic studies of Chl. chlorochromatii[15, 16]. The central bacterium of âChlorochromatium aggregatumâ, hereafter denoted as âCandidatus Symbiobacter (Ca. S.) mobilisâ, is a rod-shaped member of the Betaproteobacteria (Figure 1; Figure S1 in Additional file 1). It has a single polar flagellum [17] and is most similar to non-symbiotic bacteria of family Comamonadaceae [18]. All attempts to grow the central bacterium independently from the epibionts have failed. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the epibionts and central bacteria of different types of consortia and lakes have polyphyletic origins [19â21]. To gain insights into the molecular basis for the symbiotic relationship in phototrophic consortia, we determined the complete genome sequence of âCa. S. mobilisâ, analyzed these genomes, and present here a description of âChlorochromatium aggregatumâ. Compared to free-living close relatives, âCa. S. mobilisâ has apparently undergone massive gene loss and is probably no longer capable of independent growth., Genomic data for the phototrophic consortium âChlorochromatium aggregatumâ suggest that a very sophisticated symbiotic relationship has evolved between the central bacterium, âCa. S. mobilisâ, which apparently is no longer capable of independent growth, and the epibiont, Chl. chlorochromatii, which is still capable of independent growth. We propose that three types of interactions occur between the two partners (Figure 4). Firstly, metabolite exchange, which is common in many other symbiotic organisms, also occurs in this consortium, but the wide variety of exchanged metabolites, including carbon, nitrogen and sulfur sources and vitamins, is uncommon [40]. Secondly and remarkably, âCa. S. mobilisâ can sense light and probably sulfide, which are most directly beneficial to Chl. chlorochromatii. âCa. S. mobilisâ can also sense other nutrients and probably the metabolic status of Chl. chlorochromatii. Figuratively, Chl. chlorochromatii cells are the solar panels of this self-perpetuating, solar-energy-powered bacterial machine; âCa. S. mobilisâ not only provides the bus but also the driver and a navigation system. The degree of specialization observed for these two organisms approaches that seen in multicellular organisms. Although phototrophic consortia are composed of two different organisms, studies of these consortia might offer insights into the evolutionary processes that led from single-celled to multicellular organisms. Thirdly, electron cycling mechanisms, particularly those mediated by quinones and potentially shared proton-motive force, could provide important new mechanistic bases for energy exchange in symbiotic relationships. This study provides many novel insights for this specific bacterial symbiosis, but it also reveals benchmarks for understanding other phototrophic consortia, bacterial symbioses in general, and more complex communities and multicellularity."
"23","Fixated on fixation - using ChIP to interrogate the dynamics of chromatin interactions","Leeat Keren, Eran Segal","Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science","Eran Segal","eran.segal@weizmann.ac.il","21 November 2013","","","A new study exploits the time-dependence of formaldehyde cross-linking in the commonly used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to infer the on and off rates for site-specific chromatin interactions., Efficient control of gene expression is crucial in nearly all biological processes. This control is exerted, among other things, by physical interactions between DNA regulatory regions and proteins, reading and executing the DNA-encoded instructions. Studies of the spatial organization of DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) across species, tissues, external conditions and perturbations have proven invaluable in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying transcription. Nonetheless, binding of protein and DNA is a dynamic process, in which the two associate and dissociate at certain rates, commonly referred to as the on and off rates of the reaction. Thus, even though determining average occupancies of a DBP across a population of cells is highly informative, knowing the exact rates is crucial for modeling the system and studying its dynamics. In addition, different combinations of association and dissociation rates could have different downstream effects, even if they result in the same average occupancy across cells. For example, fractional occupancy of a DBP at a specific site can indicate strong binding of the factor to this DNA location in some of the cells or, alternatively, that the factor is transiently bound in many cells. These two scenarios might have important downstream implications for the resulting expression of the regulated gene., The most widespread experimental method for determining where chromatin-binding factors interact with DNA sequences is the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. In this method, cellular constituents are cross-linked by means of either UV light or, more commonly, formaldehyde to stabilize protein-DNA interactions. Next, the isolated chromatin is fragmented, and protein-DNA complexes are recovered by immunoprecipitation using an antibody that detects the protein of interest. DNA sequences bound to the factor are then interrogated using various techniques, such as PCR, hybridization and, more recently, DNA sequencing [1]. Although this standard ChIP protocol is useful in revealing the relatively specific location of protein binding, it is limited in its ability to provide kinetic information., In a recently published study, Poorey et al.[2] applied chemical reaction rate theory to model what happens during a ChIP experiment and have consequently adjusted the standard ChIP assay described above to allow the extraction of kinetic information. In the modified protocol, they perform several repetitions of the basic ChIP assay, with cross-linking times varying from fractions of a second to 30 minutes and binding assayed by quantitative PCR. The rationale underlying the investigation is that the ChIP signal observed at the end of the experiment represents an integration of the signal throughout the entire fixation period. When formaldehyde is added to the cell constituents, assuming that cross-linking occurs rapidly, it captures the existing in vivo occupancy at the time of addition at a rapid rate driven by cross-linking kinetics. From this time onwards, cross-linking ensures that bound molecules can no longer dissociate from DNA, effectively eliminating the off rate. Throughout the fixation time, protein molecules continue to bind to DNA, and these binding events are captured (cross-linked) owing to the presence of formaldehyde. Thus, further increases in signal are governed by the on rate. Fitting the model to several points with various fixation times, and constraining the fit by simultaneously fitting two sets of experiments with different concentrations of the binding proteins, allows the extraction of the different kinetic parameters (Figure 1). The authors name this approach the cross-linking kinetic (CLK) method.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Overview of the cross-linking kinetic (CLK) method. Schematic showing a chromatin site (blue rectangle) interacting with a transcription factor (blue circle) in a population of six cells. Red 'X’ symbols denote cross-linking. The plot shows how the site occupancy in the population and the resulting ChIP signal are predicted to change after addition of formaldehyde for varying periods of time. (Adapted from Poorey et al. [2]). ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; t, time; TF, transcription factor.
                    , To test the CLK method experimentally, the authors applied it to three transcription factors (TFs) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, spanning a range of interaction kinetics: Gal4 interacting with the GAL3 promoter, Ace1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) interacting with the CUP1 gene array and LacI-GFP interacting with an array of Lac operators. In all cases, they observed a biphasic behavior, with short fixation times leading to a fast and dramatic increase in ChIP signal, and longer incubation times resulting in a more gradual increase, as predicted by the model. They were able to extract half-life (t
                1/2) times ranging from 11 seconds (Ace1-GFP) to 10 and 20 minutes (Gal4 and LacI-GFP, respectively), suggesting that the method is suitable for a large dynamic range of interactions. The t
                1/2 values for the GFP-bound TFs were also tested by an independent method, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), which yielded a reasonably good agreement with the CLK results., The authors applied the CLK method to investigate the interaction of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) with seven different promoters driven by different RNA polymerases (pol I, pol II and pol III) that possess diverse transcriptional activities and then deduced both the steady-state occupancies and interaction half-lives. They found low occupancies for all examined promoters, suggesting that stable TBP-promoter complexes in vivo are infrequent and that most promoters are not occupied at steady state. Owing to the inherent limitations of the ChIP method, such as the low efficiency of cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, these values do not represent the actual fractional occupancies in the population, but they can provide rank-ordered estimates of fractional occupancy. Moreover, the authors found that TBP-promoter interactions varied dramatically for the different promoters, with t
                1/2 values ranging from 1 to approximately 30 minutes. It is not known what causes these different dynamics, and revealing the factors that stabilize or destabilize TBP interactions with promoters and understanding their quantitative effect on the kinetic parameters are important avenues for future research., Poorey and et al. conclude by using the CLK technique to study the action of one known regulator of TBP, the triphosphatase Mot1, that can dissociate TBP from DNA in vitro[3]. The authors measured TBP occupancy and dynamics at the URA1 and INO1 promoters in either wild-type (WT) or mot1 mutant strains. In contrast to initial expectations, they found that TBP was more dynamic in the mutant strain. Additional analyses of TBP and TFIIB occupancies genome-wide in WT and mot1 mutant strains suggest that Mot1 is responsible for dissociating weakly bound TBPs at diverse sites, thereby facilitating more-stable TBP binding in functional transcription complexes and promoting proper gene expression. This theory, warranting further experimental validations, highlights the importance of measuring quantitative kinetic parameters as a means to generate and discriminate between hypotheses., Currently, there are several methodologies for assaying the stability of in vivo interactions between DBPs and DNA. In FRAP experiments, the DBP of interest is labeled by a fluorescent fluorophore, and its dynamic assembly to a target of interest is monitored by microscopy. The key advantage of this system is in its high sensitivity, allowing the detection of short-lived interactions, and its ability to generate time-course in vivo data at the single-cell level. However, this technique is limited in terms of its resolution of chromatin binding location and normally requires genetic manipulations of both factor and binding site. Also, being an imaging-based method, it is limited in throughput and restricted to specialized laboratories possessing the appropriate experimental equipment and analysis tools [4]. This is in contrast to ChIP, which provides site-specific data on native DNA sequences, does not require genetic manipulations of the examined cells and is scalable to interrogate the entire genome in a single experiment. As such, ChIP is a common procedure in many laboratories., Owing to the appealing properties of ChIP, several attempts were recently made to modify standard ChIP protocols to enable the extraction of binding kinetics. One such example is the 'competitor ChIP’, in which two copies of the interrogated DBP are labeled with different epitopes. One copy is driven by the endogenous promoter, whereas the other (the competitor) is driven by an inducible promoter. During the experiment, the inducible DBP is activated and the replacement of the natively expressed DBP by the competitor at different loci is monitored by means of ChIP utilizing antibodies against the different epitopes [5, 6]. In the work by Poorey and colleagues [2], a different method for extracting kinetic parameters is presented, by varying the time of formaldehyde fixation. One appealing property of this method is that it requires no genetic manipulations and should thus be readily applicable to any organism of interest. As in all ChIP-based methods, the results cannot be interpreted in terms of the fraction of the cell population that is bound by a specific DBP as the efficiency of cross-linking, fragmentation and immunoprecipitation can vary from site to site and between factors. As this field continues to evolve, comparing results from all methods for the same DBPs should provide important information as to the strengths and limitations of each., The CLK method joins a body of recent work in the field of chromatin in which modifications have been introduced to long-established protocols to improve their accuracy and advance our quantitative understanding of DNA binding [5, 7, 8]. These studies make it evident that protocols should not be fixated and that altering existing protocols can lead to advances in biology. It is intriguing to speculate what other biological properties are hidden at our fingertips in the ordinary and routine experiments that we perform daily."

Genetically engineered mouse models are a useful resource for studying mammary cancers in vivo under genetically controlled and immune competent conditions. Identifying murine models with conserved human tumor features will facilitate etiology determinations, highlight the effects of mutations on pathway activation, and should improve preclinical drug testing., Transcriptomic profiles of 27 murine models of mammary carcinoma and normal mammary tissue were determined using gene expression microarrays. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified 17 distinct murine subtypes. Cross-species analyses using three independent human breast cancer datasets identified eight murine classes that resemble specific human breast cancer subtypes.

Gene signature analysis identified hundreds of commonly expressed pathway signatures between linked mouse and human subtypes, highlighting potentially common genetic drivers of tumorigenesis., This study of murine models of breast carcinoma encompasses the largest comprehensive genomic dataset to date to identify human-to-mouse disease subtype counterparts. Our approach illustrates the value of comparisons between species to identify murine models that faithfully mimic the human condition and indicates that multiple genetically engineered mouse models are needed to represent the diversity of human breast cancers. The reported trans-species associations should guide model selection during preclinical study design to ensure appropriate representatives of human disease subtypes are used.","","Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American women [1]. While increased public awareness has led to earlier detection, a greater understanding of tumor biology has led to the development of many promising therapeutics [2, 3]. A difficult frontier, however, has been identifying the appropriate target population for new drug(s) as not all breast cancer patients will respond to a particular therapeutic. Currently, only approximately 5% of oncology drugs that enter clinical testing are ultimately approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use [4]. This low success rate reflects not only the difficulty of developing anticancer therapeutics, but also identifies flaws in preclinical testing methodology for selecting the most appropriate cancer patient subset for early clinical testing [5, 6]., Numerous murine models of breast cancer have been created to mimic the genetic aberrations found in human tumors [7–30]. Historically, each model has been analyzed independent of other models, which complicates effective comparisons with human tumors. However, when multiple models are consolidated into a single dataset, there is increased sensitivity to detect features that are conserved with the human disease state [31, 32]. Identifying murine models that faithfully mimic specific human breast cancer subtypes [33–35] is an important need for the proper interpretation of mouse model results, and thus for translating preclinical findings into effective human clinical trials [36]. To address this need, we used a transcriptomic approach to profile tumors from 27 different genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). We define and characterize 17 distinct murine subtypes of mammary carcinoma (referred to as classes herein to distinguish them from the human subtypes), which we compare to three human breast tumor datasets comprising over 1,700 patients to determine which GEMM classes resemble specific human breast cancer subtypes., Human breast cancer is a genetically complex disease consisting of well characterized molecular subtypes [33, 35]. Mouse models can provide an excellent resource to study human disease, but it is essential to ensure the chosen models accurately replicate genetic alterations and overall phenotypes observed in human tumors. Thus, a number of considerations must be kept in mind when designing and/or selecting GEMMs to mimic the human disease state; these features should include intramodel tumor diversity, the degree of genetic similarity, the degree of transcriptomic similarity, and histological similarity (a topic not addressed here). By consolidating mouse models of breast carcinoma into a single dataset, this study was able to investigate the first three of these issues, in which we identified murine models for all of the major human expression subtypes., To address intramodel tumor diversity, three types of models were identified based on hierarchical clustering analysis: ‘homogeneous’ , ‘semi-homogeneous’ , and ‘heterogeneous’. ‘Homogeneous’ GEMMs were associated with a single murine expression class and were generally created through the expression of oncogenes, possibly relying less on secondary or tertiary mutations that arise during tumor progression. These GEMMs make good experimental models because the phenotypes of individual tumors are consistent and similar. ‘Semi-homogeneous’ models, such as TgMMTV-Wnt1, were associated with two murine classes. We hypothesize that unknown secondary events after the initial transgene lesion determine the class fate of these developing tumors. These varying combinations of secondary lesions may cooperate with aberrant Wnt1 signaling to target different mammary cell populations, contributing to model complexity. The last type of model comprises tumors with ‘heterogeneous’ gene expression patterns (that is, models showing three or more distinct phenotypes). In contrast to ‘homogeneous’ models, the majority of the ‘heterogeneous’ models were based on disrupting the function of tumor suppressor genes. Again, we hypothesize that secondary events after the initial transgene lesion are involved in the class fate determination of these tumors. For example, the Trp53
                -/-
                 model shows specific DNA copy number changes associated with each expression class [32]. From an experimental perspective, special considerations (that is, phenotyping each individual tumor) must be made to account for this heterogeneity, especially when these models will be utilized for therapeutic efficacy testing., Despite the diversity of the models tested here, we found that these mouse models collapse into distinct murine classes that recapitulate specific human subtypes on a gene expression-based level. These results are important as they allow for the identification of shared characteristics/lesions between murine and human tumors, and they direct researchers toward appropriate in vivo models of specific human subtypes for future experimental testing. Basal-like breast tumors are one the most aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. Herein, we find that three murine classes recapitulated human basal-like breast cancers: C3TagEx, MycEx, and p53null-BasalEx. The human basal-like subtype is characterized by high proliferation [49], genomic instability [46], and expression of a c-MYC signature [39, 44]. These murine classes share these hallmarks as evident by high expression of the proliferation gene cluster, cell cycle pathways, and chromosome instability gene-signatures; thus, there are clear GEMMs of human basal-like tumors that share both common genetic drivers and expression features., Murine Claudin-lowEx tumors were identified that significantly mimic the human claudin-low subtype; however, no homogeneous murine model was specific to this class/subtype. Instead, rare tumors from multiple heterogeneous models coalesced into the murine claudin-low group. As an experimental solution to this heterogeneous GEMM complication, the T11 orthotopic, transplantable syngeneic model was derived from a Claudin-lowEx BALB/c Trp53
                -/-
                 tumor (753R), which maintains its claudin-low expression features even after multiple transplant passages [32]. This transplantable model has been used for extensive therapeutic testing [48], thus suggesting that one method of ‘capturing’ a heterogeneous model in a single state can be accomplished via the serial transplantation of a phenotypically characterized individual tumor. As in the human claudin-low subtype, Trp53 mutation/loss was a common genetic event in mouse Claudin-lowEx tumors. Similarly, both species highly express epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition related genes and inflammatory gene signatures, and have low expression of many epithelial cell adhesion genes, including E-cadherin [34]., Discovered here was the Erbb2-likeEx murine class, which associated with human HER2-enriched tumors even without highly expressing the Erbb2 gene; no mouse model from our previous studies mimicked this aggressive human tumor subtype. One homogeneous model was found within this class, namely TgWAPCre-Etv6. This model expresses the Etv6-Ntrk3 fusion gene product, a protein that has been associated with secretory breast cancers [50]. Consistent with this, we observed that murine Erbb2-likeEx tumors highly express a gene signature in common with lactating normal mammary tissue., For the human luminal breast cancer subtypes, our previous study identified that the TgMMTV-Neu model represents the luminal subtypes more than it resembles HER2-enriched tumors [31]. We provide further evidence here that the murine NeuEx class specifically associates with human luminal A tumors. Conserved with humans, murine NeuEx tumors highly express several tyrosine kinase pathway-related gene-signatures, namely EGFR and HER2, which would be expected based upon the nature of the Neu/ERBB2 transgene. It has been shown that TgMMTV-Neu tumors regress with lapatinib treatment [48], giving credence to our approach for identifying drug targetable driver/maintenance pathways in these tumors using a computational pathway-based approach. Interestingly, only the murine MycEx class was shown to consistently associate with luminal B tumors. Since the MycEx class was also identified as a basal-like model, aberrant Myc activation may be a common hallmark of these two aggressive subtypes., While our main focus was to identify human-to-mouse disease counterparts, about half of the mouse classes did not statistically associate with specific human subtypes by our broad analysis. Several of these mouse-specific classes, however, had clear basal-like tumor expression features, including WapINT3Ex, Wnt1-LateEx, Wnt1-EarlyEx, and Squamous-likeEx. Unlike the other three, the Squamous-likeEx class consisted of a variety of models (for example, Pik3ca-H1047R, Brg1
                +/-, and DMBA-induced) and trended toward an association with human claudin-low tumors. Similarly, several classes had luminal expression features, highlighted by PyMTEx and Stat1Ex. Although the PyMTEx class had a relatively small number of samples, these tumors trended toward an association with the luminal B subtype. The Stat1Ex class also had several strong luminal features, consistent with prior characterization of this model [11]. Given the expression of ERα in these STAT1-defecient tumors [11], the lack of an association with either the luminal A or luminal B human subtypes was unexpected., An unanswered question concerning these human-to-mouse associations is the finding that murine classes like Erbb2-likeEx, and NeuEx, associate with specific human subtypes despite the fact that they apparently do not show expression of one of these human subtype-defining genes (HER2/ERBB2 in the case of Erbb2-likeEx and ESR1 in the case of NeuEx). Three hypotheses that could explain this finding are: 1) the cell type of origin of the tumor (but not a genetic driver) is the same across species and this is the major linking phenotype; 2) additional unknown genetic driver(s) are responsible for the common phenotype across species; or 3) some combination of hypothesis 1 and 2. We favor the common cell type of origin hypothesis, but additional experiments like lineage tracing will be required to unequivocally determine this., Related to this, there are at least two confounding features within our dataset that should also be considered when interpreting these results. First, most of the oncogene-driven mouse models analyzed here used either the MMTV or WAP promoter in their design. If the activity of these promoters varies as a function of specific mammary cell types, such as luminal versus myoepithelial cells, then only those cells that naturally use these promoters would ever give rise to a tumor in these models; we note that most of the MMTV or WAP driven tumors were luminal. Second, similar complications potentially exist with regards to mouse strain. Varying the background genetics in which a model is designed can influence tumor phenotype, and thus classification. Unfortunately, our dataset is underpowered to adequately address these two confounding features, but future experiments/models could be designed to address these questions., While some of the mouse classes were identified as good counterparts for specific human subtypes, many were not. There are several possibilities to explain this lack of association. The first is that these classes are specific to murine mammary carcinomas and do not have a matching counterpart in humans. The second might be that these murine classes model rare phenotypes that exist in only a small subset of human breast cancer patients, and that these rare human subtypes were not present in the datasets used here. Similarly, more mouse tumors for classes with small numbers may be required to increase statistical power to detect an association; for example, we hypothesize this to be the case for the PyMTEx class. The third possibility is that these novel murine classes share phenotypes with multiple human subtypes, and thus may never be classified as being similar to a single human subtype. Some murine tumor features were shared across multiple human subtypes (for example, MycEx with human basal-like and luminal B), which our presented analysis is more likely to undervalue. While this study provides a framework for identifying GEMMs that could be useful for preclinical drug testing, the simultaneous analysis of 27 mouse models restricted our trans-species comparisons to only expression-based analyses. The scope of our future work will focus on using models selected based upon these data for preclinical therapeutic testing to better determine the translational utility of these GEMMs. These experiments are already underway and producing promising results using the TgMMTV-Neu, TgC3(1)-Tag, and claudin-low T11 models [48, 51–53]. For example, in Roberts et al.[51], we showed that the CyclinD1 dependent TgMMTV-Neu tumors are sensitive to a CDK4/6 inhibitor, while the basal-like TgC3(1)-Tag tumors were not; these studies are consistent with findings coming from human clinical trials of luminal/ER + breast cancers, which were generally noted to be sensitive to a CDK4/6 inhibitor [54]. Similarly, a trans-species genetic screen by Bennett et al.[53] identified two ribonucleotide reductase genes (RRM1 and RRM2) and a checkpoint kinase (CHK1) as potential targets for triple-negative breast cancer patients, which they validated in both species with drug treatment experiments using TgC3(1)-Tag and human xenograft tumors., Lastly, the data presented in this study may provide an explanation for a recent paper that concluded that murine models are not helpful for studying acute human inflammatory disease [55]. Their conclusion was drawn from a comparison using a single mouse strain/model (that is, C57BL6) versus a large number of humans. Based on the data presented here, we predict that multiple mouse strains/models would need to be tested before such a conclusion could be made. To improve preclinical study designs using mouse models for any disease, it is our recommendation that the following steps be used as guidelines: 1) select/create multiple mouse models for comparative analysis to humans; 2) classify the phenotype(s) of each model with a specific focus on the degree of intramodel ‘heterogeneity’; and 3) objectively compare each model to the human disease state to identify the possible trans-species counterparts. With this approach, it is likely that some strains/models might be rejected as not mimicking the human disease state, while others may, and it is those that do that are the most valuable for preclinical testing. We suggest that the use of this approach will increase the predictive nature of preclinical studies in mice., We consolidate 27 murine models of breast carcinoma into the largest comprehensive genomic dataset to date, and we provide a detailed characterization of each to better understand how these GEMMs recapitulate phenotypes of the human subtypes. The data presented here provide insight into the molecular pathways involved in specific breast cancer subtypes and should serve as a useful resource when designing preclinical studies and interpreting their results."

I was honored to have the opportunity to present a novel template-strand sequencing technique (Strand-seq) for finding genomic instability events such as sister chromatid exchanges, translocations and aneuploidy, adding to the genomic profiling possibilities in single cells. I was fortunate that this meeting also presented the opportunity to discover how plant genomics is at the forefront of epigenomics, and is pushing sequencing technologies and bioinformatics to catch up with the complex genomes of crops. Equally interesting were the innovative bioinformatics and IT tools that help translate the A, T, C and G into a narrative of where we came from as a species, and to where we are headed in clinical research., It is very revealing that many of the speakers in the single-cell genomics session prefaced their talks by remarking that they no longer have to convince an audience of the advantages of single-cell genomic analysis. The intersection of lower sequencing costs and validated techniques has shifted single-cell genomics from concept to mainstream. However, there is plenty of room for improving these techniques. Keynote speaker Stephen Quake (Stanford University, USA) showed that integrating a microfluidics platform allows precise control over the fluid dynamics, to maximize precision, reproducibility and efficiency of reactions. Session chair Nicholas Navin (MD Anderson Cancer Center, USA) reminded us that we are still at the beginnings of single-cell genomics, and predicted that there will be further complexity as epigenomic and spatial organization maps will fulfill complete single-cell genomic profiles in the future., As pointed out by Sunney Xie (Harvard University, USA), each cell has a unique genome. Thus, one major focus of this session was to profile these unique genomes in individual primary tumor cells, metastases and circulating tumor cells to identify potentially targetable features responsible for the evolution of a cancer to acquire mobility, adaptability, resistance and response to therapy. A recurring idea was that copy number variation (CNV) may be a more accurate signature to follow cancer evolution than the accumulation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Xie reported that in individual lung cancer patients, while SNVs vary between individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs), CNV signatures are more consistent and match those from metastatic but not primary tumor cells. In addition, CNV signatures of CTCs between different patients can accurately cluster patients into lung cancer subtypes, matching their disease progression state. These data argue for CNVs as an important diagnostic tool, a hypothesis seconded by James Hicks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, USA), who also argued that CNV breakpoints reveal a cancer cell’s history and lineage. However, he reported CNV heterogeneity between CTCs of different prostate cancer patients as well as within individual patients, arguing for a more dynamic evolution and adaptability of cancer cells. Devon Lawson (University of California, San Francisco, USA) also demonstrated heterogeneity between individual cells isolated from metastatic breast cancer xenografts, using gene expression profiling., The idea of having many genomes within one individual was demonstrated by a high proportion of de novo translocations and aneuploidy during early zygotic cell divisions in pre-implantation human embryos (Thierry Voet, Sanger Institute, UK). Finding structural variations as well as SNV signatures for pre-implantation genetic screening of in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos was also shown by Fei Gao (BGI-Shenzhen, China) and Fuchou Tang (Peking University, China). Tang showed that a complete genomic profile of polar bodies (which are byproducts of meiosis and do not contribute to embryonic or extra-embryonic tissues) can be used to infer the CNV profile, chromosomal abnormalities, and potentially SNVs and haplotypes of oocytes and pre-implantation embryo cells, allowing the healthiest oocytes and embryos to be selected for IVF and implantation., The favored plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana is diploid, has a relatively small genome with little repetitive DNA, and several decades of genetic studies to link DNA sequence to epigenetic inheritance and phenotype. Not surprisingly, Arabidopsis was well represented in the plant genomics session. Rob Martienssen (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, USA) and Ryan Lister (University of Western Australia, Australia) both detailed the extraordinary small RNA-dependent pathways that lead to methylation and silencing of repetitive transposable elements (TEs). Lister presented evidence that TE silencing via these small RNA silencing pathways is upregulated in stem cell niches such as the meristem and columella, to protect the development and differentiation programs in stem and progenitor cells from being disrupted by TE de-repression. The role of companion cells that upregulate and transport small RNAs to stem cells in the root tip or to germ cells in pollen illustrated the complex pathways that can be decoded in plants., Another major focus was the contribution of the epigenome and epigenetic inheritance to the genotype-phenotype equation. Robert Schmitz (Salk Institute, USA) uncovered spontaneous epialleles via methylome sequencing of multiple generations, which are not due to structural variations. However, Magnus Nordborg (Gregor Mendel Institute of Molecular Plant Biology, Austria) argued in his keynote address that 'genetics rules!’, meaning that the effects of genetics far outweigh the effects of environmental and epigenetic variation. His study of Arabidopsis from natural populations found that associations between the flowering time phenotype and differential methylation patterns could also be explained by SNVs. He proposed that many of the epigenetic variations in these populations are the outcome of sequence variation., But plant genomics is often not afforded the luxury of having an ideal diploid model organism such as Arabidopsis. The extremely complex polyploid, repetitive and heterozygous genomes of many crop plants led wheat to be lightheartedly labeled as the 'bad guy’ of plant genomics by session chair Mario Caccamo (The Genome Analysis Centre, UK). However, Jorge Dubcovsky (University of California, Davis, USA) argued that the potential to knock out every gene in wheat makes it ideal for functional genomics, and therefore, a 'good guy.’ He outlined efforts to sequence genomes of 1,000 wheat mutants and make sequence and seeds publicly available to researchers, with no intellectual property restrictions. It was very clear, however, that the large 'beast’-like genomes of crop plants are pushing the limits of sequencing and bioinformatics technology. The current approach of building a high quality assembly from short sequencing reads is confounded by the reality of these complex genomes. As Caccamo stated, there must be an integrated effort to combine whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, RNA sequencing, long mate pairs and single molecule reads with genetic maps to achieve a high-quality genome assembly for wheat and other complex crops. The continual advancement of sequencing and bioinformatics technologies will undoubtedly boost this effort., Session chair Michael Schatz (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, USA) proposed that the formula for a good genome assembly is long reads, good coverage and high quality. Achieving this from the degraded DNA from fossils is a major challenge, as Janet Kelso (Max Planck Institute, Germany) discussed. She presented a novel technique to obtain high-quality, high-coverage assemblies from ancient genomes, and showed that the genomic recipe for what makes modern humans differ from Neanderthals is surprisingly small. Assembling a quality transcriptome from short RNA-seq reads is equally challenging, but Alicia Oshlack (Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Australia) presented a clever algorithm called CORSET that clusters RNA-seq read fragments based on overlapping sequence and expression level, helping distinguish paralogs and alternatively spliced genes., There is also urgency for clever bioinformatics tools to wade through the mountains of data that both the average lab and large sequencing centers can generate from genomics studies. Jeremy Goecks (Emory University, USA) outlined the features of the intuitive and user-friendly Galaxy platform for high-throughput analysis. This web-based approach to computing nicely demonstrated the power of bringing the computing to the data, and not vice versa. But bioinformatic challenges of genomic studies go far beyond needing clever software. As Geoffrey Noer (Panasas, USA) and Chris Dagdigian (BioTeam, USA) both pointed out, the science of sequencing is generating data faster than most underlying IT infrastructures can handle. Data storage and file retrieval, even for the average lab, will continue to be major issues as datasets become larger and need to be more integrated. There will need to be more forethought put into IT policy, infrastructure setup and administration, integrating physical and cloud-based resources prior to undertaking projects., The final keynote of the meeting, delivered by David Haussler, was a powerful reminder that the current reality of 'silos’ of genomic data isolated by outdated confidentiality policies is preventing the true potential of these rich genomic datasets, and is threatening to become a lost opportunity to learn from available data. He argued that we should act now to establish an open and shared genomic database resource that can be easily accessed by all researchers to increase the power of clinical diagnosis and treatment. The goal of precision medicine for each individual will only be possible if we learn from the collective data of a large population., It was evident from this meeting that there is no such thing as a single genome. There is seemingly infinite genomic diversity between individual cells, and we are only now starting to connect this diversity to cell function and disease. Technological advancements will add more complexity, integrating epigenomics, spatial organization and genomic evolution into the complete profiles of cells. It is up to researchers and bioinformaticians to realize that these data will only be useful if they are interpretable, accessible and open. The right tools to analyze, store and access data will need to evolve in parallel with forward-looking policies and data management systems to realize the full potential of the post-genomic era."

It is a heterogeneous disease with distinct histological and clinical outcomes and classifies into three basic therapeutic groups: (1) estrogen receptor (ER) positive, (2) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified and (3) triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs, which are negative for ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2). This gave rise to the notion of tailoring patient treatment plans based on the patient’s genomic characteristics, making breast cancer the poster child for precision medicine. In this issue of Genome Biology, Joe Gray and colleagues develop this concept of precision medicine for breast cancer using a machine learning approach to computer modeling [1]., Seminal work in techniques for gene expression profiling analysis has led to the classification of breast cancer into six different subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, basal-like, claudin-low and normal-like) [2, 3]. Multi-gene supervised class-predictors based on the six subtypes were subsequently developed for prognostic classification [2, 3]. The predictors are now clinically available (examples include PAM50®, Oncotype DX®, MammaPrint®, MapQuantDx®, Theros® and Endopredict®). These first-generation gene signatures can also be partially used as predictive gene signatures and have been instrumental in sparing a subgroup of ER-positive breast cancer patients from adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy [4, 5]. However, there has been less success in the development of gene signatures to predict response to specific therapeutic agents, and as such no commercially available tests are currently available., Other genomic technologies, such as genome copy number, next-generation sequencing, DNA methylation arrays, RNA-seq and protein expression, add higher resolution and additional layers of information. The integration of these datasets has further refined breast cancer classification into additional distinct subtypes. Large-scale genomic efforts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [6] and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) [7] have comprehensively characterized key genomic changes in a large dataset of breast cancers but did not relate these omic characteristics to drug response., Application of integrated molecular datasets to develop clinically useful predictive gene signatures to guide precision medicine is currently under way [5]. However, there are three noteworthy studies that generated predictive multigene signatures. One study used a multifactorial approach to identify a multi-gene classifier as predictive for response to anthracyclines. The resulting anthracycline-based score (A-score) could serve as a valuable tool for sparing a subset of breast cancer patients from chemotherapy [4, 5, 8]. Similarly, the amplification of chromosome 8q22 and/or overexpression of YWHAZ/LAPTM4B can be used as predictive biomarkers to anthracycline response [5]. A 165-gene signature (termed the SET index) has also been developed to predict response to endocrine therapy [4, 5]., Cancer cell lines that have molecular characteristics that closely mirror their tumor counterparts have proved useful as preclinical models for therapeutic response and predictive biomarker development for experimental drugs [9, 10]. Sometimes, cancer cell lines are the only possible model to investigate experimental therapeutics. Two recent studies performed large-scale unbiased drug screens in collections of cancer cell lines across many types of cancer [9, 10] and have substantially expanded the annotation of these cell line collections and our understanding of the predictive usefulness of gene signatures., It is unclear whether the recently available molecular data types are essential and which combinations of these data types would provide the best predictors for breast cancer. In this issue of Genome Biology, Gray and colleagues address this question by developing disease-specific predictive signatures of response for a collection of breast cancer cell lines [1]. Their study expands the number of breast cancer-specific cell lines and therapeutic agents used as well as collecting comprehensive molecular data types: genomic data were obtained from 70 breast cancer cell lines in response to 90 experimental or approved therapeutic agents. The molecular profiling datasets included mutation status of selected genes of interest, copy number aberrations, gene expression (including splice variants), promoter DNA methylation and protein expression. In addition to identifying predictive markers of response and testing their performance in TCGA samples, the authors also examined the importance of specific and integrated datasets for response predictor development., Gray and colleagues used two machine-learning approaches, the weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machine and Random Forests, to develop response signatures [1]. Cell lines were classified as sensitive or resistant based on the mean GI50 value for that compound (that is, the concentration at which growth is inhibited by 50%). Regardless of classification method, the signatures predicted response with high estimated accuracy (area under curve (AUC) >0.70) for 57% of the compounds tested. The two classification methods showed high correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.85; P-value, <0.001), especially for compounds that had strong biomarkers or no biomarkers of response. However, this did not hold for compounds that showed a weaker signal of drug response - for these compounds, selection of alternative response variables might improve performance in the future., Cell line-derived response signatures were validated in vivo for tamoxifen and valproic acid, where the -omic signatures accurately predicted the chemotherapy response. For the compounds where in vivo data were not available, the presence of the signature was tested for in 536 breast TCGA tumors instead. Tumors and their respective cell lines shared similar gene expression patterns, suggesting that the signatures might be effective in predicting response in patient samples. Many of these compounds are FDA approved or in clinical trials and hence could be validated in the near future., Another important finding was that there was no single molecular dataset that always outperformed the rest. However, in general, RNA-seq performed better than the other data-types across all the compounds, and copy number array data performed worse. The basis for RNA-seq’s superior performance in most cases was its improved sensitivity and dynamic range, and not its detection of splice sites. Splice-site awareness was only beneficial for prediction of response to ERBB2-targeting compounds., The transcriptional dataset alone was sufficient to predict responses (AUC >0.70) in 25% of compounds. This is currently being done for ER+ and HER2+ breast cancers when guiding the selective use of chemotherapy, as described previously. Addition of other molecular datasets was able to significantly increase prediction for 65% of compounds. The mutation status of genes encoding TP53, PIK3CA, MLL3, CDH1, MAP2K4, PTEN and NCOR1 was primarily useful for predicting response to tamoxifen and the polyamine analog CGC-11144. This suggests that, for the majority of compounds, a combinatorial approach involving multiple molecular datasets (although not all) would prove beneficial. Validation studies in clinical trials will help clarify which combinations of data-types are most useful and whether there are similarities in response to certain classes of compounds. For example, the authors found that RNA-seq performed better for polyamine analogs and mitotic inhibitors, copy number array was better for inhibitors of ERBB2/EGFR, and DNA methylation profiling was best for inhibitors of CDK1., There are a few caveats to this study. Although cell lines are good models for developing predictive drug signatures, they have certain drawbacks that limit their ability to recapitulate the primary tumors. Specifically, they disregard the molecular heterogeneity inherent to breast cancer and any associated influences of the microenvironment [4, 5]. Most of the cell lines are epithelial in origin, and do not include stromal and immune components that are known to be important contributors to malignant progression [4, 5]. Variations in oxygen content that are known to affect therapeutic responses are also not addressed by cell line models. Performing similar experiments in three-dimensional model systems or in mouse xenografts would help address some of these caveats and further refine the signatures. Furthermore, the clonal-evolutionary dynamics of the tumor are also largely unaddressed. Patient-specific molecular biomarker signatures could be developed by serial molecular monitoring of disease progression in response to therapeutic agents. This could be especially useful in patients that fail to respond to the physician’s first choice of drug., The holy grail of precision medicine is matching the right drug to the patient. For new drugs in development, the inverse of finding patients most likely to respond to an experimental compound is also equally important for those clinical trials driven by -omics data. While both of these are momentous tasks, compounds can be ranked based on their predicted efficacies in individual patients and validated in prospective clinical trials. By creating a publicly available software tool that can predict drug response in individual tumors, the authors have taken us one step closer to the promise of precision medicine [1]. They applied this tool to 306 TCGA samples for which expression, copy number and DNA methylation data were available. Almost all patients (99.3%) had received at least one compound that they were predicted to respond to, and each patient was predicted to respond to an average of approximately six treatments. A future application of this tool could be to assign approved or experimental agents to individual patients in the clinic or biomarker-guided clinical trials, respectively., Accurate predictors of response can be developed for compounds that have a strong associated molecular signature. For these compounds, combinatorial approaches involving multiple platforms are not necessary. These compounds are also the best candidates for transition to a single-platform lab diagnostic. For compounds with a weaker signal of drug response, adding additional platforms or identifying alternative response variables might improve efficacy., As many of the compounds tested by Gray and colleagues are in clinical trials, further validation of their identified molecular signatures is likely to be imminent. A logical way forward for validating these signatures for approved therapeutic agents is a direct comparison of patient outcome when the drug selected is the physician’s first treatment choice versus the top drug from the in vitro predictor tool. Validation of predictive biomarkers requires large multi-center randomized trials that are logistically challenging and expensive. This study is a good basis for such a multi-arm trial, where the simultaneous testing of a panel of compounds could accelerate the validation of the in vitro signatures. Optimizing the molecular features of the signature as well as the thresholds for tumor classification would also be possible in such a clinical trial setting. By developing the next generation of predictive biomarkers, Gray and colleagues’ study, together with other research like it, gets us one step closer to precision medicine."

The ‘sequencing boom’ has driven the creation of an assortment of new companies, as well as heavy investment from existing companies, to provide sequencing solutions, library preparation reagents and bioinformatics support. This was evidenced by the 20 or so companies represented at the meeting., Scott Brouilette (Illumina) introduced a clever genome phasing solution based on work from Stephen Quake’s lab (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, USA) that relies on sequencing of large DNA fragments (6 to 8 kb) aliquoted at limiting dilution. This allows for segregation of haplotypes and resolution of cases of compound heterozygosity, as well as improved assembly of repetitive regions., Clive Brown (Oxford Nanopore, UK) provided a much-anticipated update that highlighted the technical hurdles that Oxford Nanopore has had to overcome to produce nanopore arrays that not only work but are also shippable. Oxford Nanopore has now put more emphasis on the release of the portable MinION, for which field-testing is ongoing, while it continues to develop the modular GridION system. The technology can deliver multi-kilobase reads, and can process 50 kb reads with consistent data quality throughout. Much of the interest in nanopores goes beyond their potential as DNA sequencers and, according to Brown, any given nanopore type can distinguish about one-third of all known DNA modifications, such that a combination of pores could potentially resolve them all. The future may also see RNA and protein sequencing through nanopores, but for now we await the arrival of the first commercial nanopore DNA sequencer., One technology that can already deliver robust detection of DNA modifications, including 6-methyladenine (6mA), is the PacBio system - Paul Coupland (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) shared his experience in using it in a variety of contexts. The system has undergone significant upgrades at several levels and Coupland reported sequencing, on average, 2 to 3 kb library inserts (although the polymerase can deliver longer reads). Apart from 6mA detection, some of the most interesting applications of the technology that were touched on were the sequencing of single-cell cDNA, where whole transcripts are visible and isoforms resolved easily, and the direct sequencing of viral and bacterial genomes without the need for library preparation., As genomics research moves into diagnostics, targeted technologies that can deliver in-the-field results quickly and cheaply are necessary. Jonathan O’Halloran (QuantuMDx Group, UK) presented an impressive hand-held device (Q-POC) that performs accurate multiple diagnostics in less than 20 minutes from the point of sample collection (and aiming to get under 10 minutes). The device incorporates a microfluidics chamber for rapid DNA amplification and a nanowire-based hybridization system for multiplexed detection of up to 100 pathogens or genetic variants. The company is hoping the technology will change medical diagnostics in developing countries where the current need for expensive lab-based analyses is hampering efficient treatment., While generating sequencing data is now a routine undertaking, extracting meaningful results often remains a challenge. Bioinformatic analyses are not only vital for dissecting out key results but can also feedback useful information for experimental planning. Indeed, Geoff Barton (University of Dundee, UK) and his team (talks also by Marek Gierlinski and Nick Schurch, University of Dundee, UK) performed careful analysis of RNA-seq data to answer a basic question in differential expression experiments: how many replicates are enough? In collaboration with Mark Blaxter (University of Edinburgh, UK), the same RNA-seq experiment was performed 48 times and several commonly used algorithms for differential expression analysis were tested to gauge how variability affects the calling of differentially expressed genes. While variability is bound to be different between experimental set-ups, the study nonetheless establishes a baseline of expected performance from replicate data (for example, using edgeR and a twofold change cut-off yielded an 80% true positive rate). Gierlinski pointed out that badly correlated (or outlier) replicates are present even in such a technically uniform experiment as this one, and that inclusion of these outliers invalidates the basic assumptions of differential expression algorithms. It was estimated that with three replicates there is a 24% chance of having one badly correlated replicate. One way that technically poor replicates can be detected is by using spike-in control RNAs, as was highlighted by Schurch. These can also be used as powerful data normalization controls, especially in cases where a significant portion of genes is differentially expressed in one preferred direction., If variability in a standard RNA-seq experiment already requires substantial attention, managing it in single-cell transcriptomes is crucial. John Marioni (EMBL-EBI, UK) and Xiuwei Zhang (EMBL-EBI and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK) presented their solutions to the problem, which again are based on the inclusion of spike-in RNA controls. Marioni described how such spike-in data can be used to model technical variability, and therefore ensure that true inter-cellular variability is being detected. Zhang demonstrated how the carefully designed External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) sequences can impart information not only on inter-cellular technical variability, but also on intra-cellular technical variability, allowing one to get a firm handle on the main problem of single-cell RNA-seq and serving as a metric for the evaluation of potential protocol developments., Genomics research has amply demonstrated its invaluable use in translational research, mainly by identifying variants associated with phenotypic traits and genes implicated in rare diseases. Ultimately, genome sequencing aims to provide personalized treatment solutions that are most effective for a given individual. Zamin Iqbal (Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, UK) showed how sequencing of regional Plasmodium falciparum strains can help to design more effective drug treatments. In a striking example, Iqbal explained why a particular vaccine had failed in Africa - whilst the allele targeted by the drug was present in the reference strain, its frequency in African strains was only 16%. Prostate cancer treatment may also benefit from sequencing approaches, as Ian Sudbery (University of Oxford, UK) explained that patients that acquire resistance to androgen deprivation treatment (ADT) commonly show upregulation of genes involved in Wnt signaling. Using cell line models, Sudbery showed that inhibition of Wnt signaling may be a useful strategy for reversal of ADT resistance., If these encouraging studies are representative examples of how genomics research may improve patient care, then the ambitious plans outlined by Mark Caulfield (Genomics England, UK) are going to constitute a landmark transformation in our approach to clinical diagnostics and treatment. Genomics England is a company that was recently set up by the Department of Health to sequence 100,000 genomes of rare diseases, common cancers and pathogens in NHS patients. Among common cancers, expert panels have carefully chosen to focus on childhood cancers and lung cancer; similarly, HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis will be the primarily targeted pathogens. Caulfield described the plans of the company for patient sample collection, sequencing and data management, a well thought-through process that has established solid ground from which the project will develop. The first pilot study, planned for 2014, will aim to sequence 2,000 genomes from patients with rare disease at 30× coverage. Beyond the primary objectives of encouraging new drug discovery and providing faster diagnostics, Genomics England hopes to drive down the cost of sequencing, and intends to train the wider healthcare community to use the technology, enabling the NHS to embrace genomic medicine at an unparalleled scale. Caulfield is under no illusion that this monumental effort may be seen as trying to walk before you can crawl in the minds of many, but remains confident that such leaps in human endeavor have proven in the long term to be world-changing., I would like to thank Tamir Chandra and Helen Zenner for comments on the manuscript."

The A and B boxes serve as principal binding sites for the multisubunit transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC), which recruits TATA binding protein (TBP) and other TFIIIB subunits to a region just upstream of the Pol III transcription start site (TSS) [2]. For tRNAs, the A and B box sequence elements are incorporated into the transcript and are recognized by processing (and other) factors. For example, RNase Z - the endonuclease that removes the 3â² trailer from precursor-tRNA - recognizes the pseudouridine stem loop (Î¨ loop) that is derived from the B box (Figure 1a, b).

Note that the internal A and B box promoter elements of the gene are represented in the tRNA as the dihydrouridine loop (D loop) and pseudouridine (Î¨ loop). The latter comprises a structural element recognized by RNase Z. Right: a speculative potential structure of a Pol III-dependent pre-snoRNA.
                    , Recent studies in yeast have shown that tRNA genes also play roles in chromatin and higher order genome organization [3]. TFIIIC binds to condensin and leads to clustering of tRNA genes in the nucleolus [4]. We understand a bit about gene clustering, but apart from that our general understanding of genome organization is poor - for all metazoans, mammals included, and for all Pol III-transcribed genes, tRNA included [5]., In some species, variable fractions of the numerous genes that encode snoRNAs are under the control of Pol III, utilizing A and B box promoters [6]. The snoRNAs can be classified into two major classes: ones that direct pseudouridylation and others that direct 2â²-O-ribose methylation of rRNAs. In yeast, only one of the 75 snoRNA genes is transcribed by Pol III while the rest rely on Pol II, and all of the approximately 450 human snoRNAs are transcribed by Pol II, either independently or as parts of introns of larger transcripts [6]. It is important to note that Caenorhabditis elegans is exceptional in this regard since almost half of its approximately 140 annotated snoRNA genes contain typical Pol III A and B box promoters downstream of the TSS, followed by the snoRNA sequence. Accordingly, the A and B box sequences are transcribed as part of a 5â² leader RNA that must be removed to liberate the snoRNA [6]. In the case of plant snoRNAs that are transcribed by Pol III, this pathway is reminiscent of the 3â² processing pathway for precursor-tRNAs that contain long 3â² trailers [7]., Upon activation in yeast, several inducible genes have been shown to be relocated to the nuclear pore and this is required for their activation [8]. This relocation also helps with transcriptional memory, a property by which the kinetics of a second round of activation occurs more quickly than the first. In mammalian cells, silent chromatin associates with the nuclear periphery, although whether nuclear pores play a role in transcriptional regulation is unknown., In their recent article, Ikegami and Lieb [1] report that knocking down NPP-13 (homolog of vertebrate nucleoporin 93 (Nup93)), an integral component of the C. elegans nuclear pore, as well as other pore components, leads to a defect in the maturation of 51 of the 59 snoRNAs transcribed by Pol III. RNA-seq and other genomics approaches indicate that these snoRNAs retain the 5â² leader sequence, suggesting the processing activity that removes the 5â² leader is compromised. A knee-jerk reaction to these findings would be to query whether this effect is indirect, perhaps due to disrupted transport of a key Pol III transcription or RNA processing factor. However, attempts to address this by examining mRNA levels of known RNA processing factors did not support this hypothesis., Examination of global RNA-seq data also revealed that two tRNA genes with weak Pol III terminators retained their 3â² trailers. Although the extent of these 3â² trailer retentions was not as robust as for the snoRNAs, this alerted the authors to examine tRNA genes more closely., Only a subset of snoRNA and tRNA genes show evidence of association with the nuclear pore complex (124 of the 609 tRNA genes and 51 of the 59 Pol III snoRNA genes). ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data showed that three nuclear pore proteins, NPP-13, NPP-3 and importin-Î² protein (IMB-1), produced nearly identical patterns of Pol III gene loci - strong evidence that the subsets selected were not random. It is known that NPP-13 and NPP-3 interact directly with each other, while IMB-1 connects via other channel proteins, arguing that the Pol III loci interact with the nuclear pore rather than the free proteins. Knockdown of the gene encoding IMB-1 did not affect snoRNA maturation, suggesting an indirect connection to the Pol III genes, with NPP-13 involved in more functional interactions., An outstanding question is how only a subset of Pol III genes differentially associates with the pore proteins. While the sequences of the A and B boxes of the pore-targeted genes were analyzed, these were not compared with the non-targeted genes and so we do not know if A and/or B box sequence composition may be a factor. In this regard, it is interesting that TFIIIC occupancy was significantly less correlated with the nuclear pore proteins compared with stronger occupancy by TFIIIB and Pol III on the Pol III snoRNA genes [1]. While upstream TATA boxes are found in a variable number of tRNA genes in different species, this was not addressed for the tRNA and snoRNA genes here. Not all mammalian Pol III genes are active at a given time, suggesting gene subset-specific activation pathways, yet the mechanisms involved are largely unknown., About 30 tRNA genes in C. elegans contain introns that must be removed by dedicated tRNA splicing enzymes, which in other metazoa are believed to localize to the nuclear membrane. In addition, tRNA modification enzymes have been localized to the nuclear inner membrane [9]. Presumably, tRNA intron retention was not a feature of the NPP-13 knockdown., Another question that arises is whether the snoRNA genes transcribed by Pol III are predominantly of the pseudouridylation or ribose methylation class. In either case, it would also be interesting to know if the snoRNA-associated proteins, comprising the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs; pseudouridylation) and the C/D snoRNPs (methylation), are required for efficient processing in this system, or if the nascent pre-assembled snoRNA is the substrate for processing., One of the most interesting ChIP-seq findings reported by Ikegami and Lieb [1] is that Pol III was found at two peaks on the snoRNA genes in normal embryos: one near the TSS and the other further downstream, toward the snoRNA processing site. However, in NPP-13-depleted embryos, the TSS peak was significantly reduced, while the downstream peak increased. Although these observations might suggest decreased Pol III initiation in the mutants, steady state RNA levels were increased upon NPP-13 depletion. Nonetheless, as the difference in Pol III position is the only difference observed in the transcriptional machinery itself, it may be argued that it is mechanistically related to the RNA processing defect. One can envision two scenarios, both involving kinetic coupling. The authors suggest that the increased downstream Pol III peak may reflect a pause due to lack of processing. An explanation for the markedly reduced peak at the TSS in the NPP-13 mutants may reflect faster promoter escape by Pol III. Thus, NPP-13 may somehow increase the dwell time of Pol III in pre-initiation mode, providing more of a kinetic window to recruit RNA processing factors. For vertebrate U1 and U2 snRNAs, it is known that proper RNA 3â² processing depends on the promoter element [10]. In any case, it will be interesting to know the mechanisms by which NPP-13 affects Pol III transcription and/or RNA processing., Nuclear pores have a core that contains the NPP-13 protein, for which both physical and functional effects on snoRNA biogenesis were shown. Their cumulative observations led the authors to suggest the likely interpretation that the affected Pol III genes may be actively transcribed within nuclear pores. However, cross linking followed by immunoprecipitation does not necessarily reflect direct interaction or sub cellular localization. It is an exciting possibility that the transcription and/or maturation of these RNAs occurs within the nuclear pores themselves. As with other thought-provoking studies, further investigations are required to advance these results. Direct visualization and other approaches will be necessary to determine whether Pol III transcription and/or nascent transcript processing occurs in the nuclear pores."

Building upon our recently described splicing code, we developed AVISPA, a Galaxy-based web tool for splicing prediction and analysis. Given an exon and its proximal sequence, the tool predicts whether the exon is alternatively spliced, displays tissue-dependent splicing patterns, and whether it has associated regulatory elements. We assess AVISPA's accuracy on an independent dataset of tissue-dependent exons, and illustrate how the tool can be applied to analyze a gene of interest. AVISPA is available at http://​avispa.​biociphers.​org., The new two-stage prediction paradigm, combined with the expanded dataset, yields a significant improvement in detecting alternative cassette exons (Figure 2a). For example, using only tissue-dependent splicing predictors achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 64% for distinguishing between alternative and constitutive exons, compared to 86% by the first stage classifier. The improved accuracy of 94% AUC achieved for detecting tissue-dependent exons is to be expected, as many regulatory features and higher intronic conservation are associated with such exons. Notably, AVISPA’s sequence-based predictions offer a significant improvement compared to a similar classifier that directly uses normalized exon expression measurements from 33 experiments [12]. The latter achieves an overall lower accuracy of 71% AUC, with a significantly 2.5-fold lower sensitivity (54% versus 21%) for high-confidence events at a false positive rate of 2%. These results illustrate the usefulness of the new tool, which generalizes over experimental conditions and is not limited by technical factors such as microarray noise or read coverage. We note that these accuracy estimates can be considered as lower bounds, as some of the events labeled as constitutive in our database may be alternative.

Detecting which exons are alternative (green) is significantly improved compared to a classifier that uses exon expression measurements from 33 experiments (cyan), and compared to the original classifier trained to detect only tissue-dependent cassette exons (red). Detection of exons that exhibit tissue-dependent splicing changes (blue, n = 659) is much more accurate. Numbers within each legend represent the area under the curve (AUC) (b) Identifying tissue-dependent splicing. Detecting tissue-dependent splicing changes (n = 865) from a random set of non-tissue-dependent exons (n = 4,000) achieves an overall accuracy of 89% AUC (black). Accuracy varies considerably between tissues and for detecting increased inclusion (solid line) or exclusion (dashed) in a tissue (c) Detection accuracy for an independent set of Mbnl1/2-dependent exons [14] (n = 461). Differentiating between Mbnl1/2-dependent exons and constitutive exons achieves 97% AUC. Accuracy in detecting Mbnl1/2-dependent exons from a random set of non-tissue-dependent exons (n = 2,000) is approximately 94% AUC for both brain (blue) and muscle (red).
                    , The new tool also achieves significant improvement in detecting tissue-dependent exons (Figure 2b). The overall accuracy in discriminating between tissue-dependent and non-tissue-dependent exons is 89% AUC, but varies considerably between tissues and between differential inclusion and exclusion in the same tissue type. For example, the highest accuracy was achieved for detecting increased inclusion of exons in CNS (94% AUC) and muscle tissues (91% AUC), while the lowest accuracy was for detecting increased exclusion in CNS (85% AUC) and increased inclusion in embryonic tissues (82% AUC)., In order to test AVISPA on an independent dataset, we computed predictions for a set of cassette exons recently shown to be regulated by the Muscleblind-like proteins Mbnl1/2 in mouse brain, muscle, and heart [14]. Figure 2c shows AVISPA easily distinguished these exons from constitutive exons (97% AUC), similar to its performance in detecting tissue-dependent alternative exons in the original test set. In discriminating the Mbnl1/2-regulated exons from non-CNS- and non-muscle-dependent exons, AVISPA achieves an AUC of 93% and 94%, respectively, while in silico removal of Mbnl1/2 caused, on average, an almost two-fold larger effect for Mbnl1/2-regulated exons compared to the effect for non-muscle- and non-heart-dependent exons. The improved accuracy in detecting Mbnl1/2-regulated exons compared to the detection of tissue-dependent exons in the original test data is likely due to a lower false detection rate from the RNA-Seq and CLIP-Seq experiments in [14]., Finally, we also tested whether the regulatory features added in the web tool were useful for splicing prediction. As expected, many of the sequence motifs implicated in general splicing regulation were included in the code, especially for differentiating between alternative and constitutive exons. By contrast, the relation between nucleosome occupancy and alternative splicing is less well understood, and has garnered much research attention [15, 16]. We found that the model selected features representing nucleosome occupancy around the alternative exon, but training the model without these features resulted in similar prediction accuracy (data not shown). This result indicates that other features in our model, such as di- and tri-nucleotide frequencies, already captured the 'predictive power' of computationally derived nucleosome position features."

The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance., I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.","","An increasing body of evidence suggests that many manifestations of aging are epigenetic [1, 2]. This article focuses on one particular type of epigenetic control: cytosine-5 methylation within CpG dinucleotides (also known as DNA methylation). Age-related DNA hypomethylation has long been observed in a variety of species, including salmon [3], rats [4], and mice [5]. More recent studies have shown that many CpGs are subject to age-related hypermethylation. A vast literature characterizes genes or genomic regions that either get hypermethylated or hypomethylated with age [6–14]. Previous studies have shown that age-related hypermethylation occurs preferentially at CpG islands [8], at bivalent chromatin domain promoters that are associated with key developmental genes [15], and at Polycomb-group protein targets [10]. The epigenomic landscape varies markedly across tissue types [16–18] and many age-related changes depend on tissue type [8, 19]. But several recent studies have shown that age-dependent CpG signatures can be defined independently of sex, tissue type, disease state and array platform [10, 13–15, 20–22]. While several recent articles describe age predictors based on DNAm levels in specific tissues (for example, saliva or blood [23, 24]), it is not yet known whether age can be predicted irrespective of tissue type using a single predictor. Here I use an unprecedented collection of publicly available DNA methylation data sets for defining and evaluating an age predictor. Its astonishing accuracy across most tissues and cell types justifies its designation as a multi-tissue age predictor. Its age prediction, referred to as DNAm age, can be used as a biomarker for addressing a host of questions arising in aging research and related fields. For example, I show that premature aging diseases (such as progeria) do not resemble healthy normal aging according to DNAm age and that interventions used for creating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells reset the epigenetic clock to zero. I also describe what can be learnt from applying DNAm age to cancer tissues and cancer cell lines., Through the generosity of hundreds of researchers, I was able to analyze an unprecedented collection of DNA methylation data from healthy tissues, cancer tissues, and cancer cell lines. The healthy tissue data allowed me to develop a multi-tissue predictor of age (mathematical details are provided in Additional file 2). An R software tutorial can be found in Additional file 20 (which requires Additional files 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27 as input). The basic approach is to form a weighted average of the 353 clock CpGs, which is then transformed to DNAm age using a calibration function. The calibration function reveals that the epigenetic clock has a high tick rate until adulthood, after which it slows to a constant tick rate., I propose that DNAm age measures the cumulative work done by an epigenetic maintenance system. This EMS model of DNAm age leads to several testable model predictions that I validate using cancer data. But irrespective of the validity of the EMS model, the findings in cancer are interesting in their own right. While all cancer tissues exhibit signs of severe age acceleration, this is not necessarily the case for individual cancer cell lines. Overall, high age acceleration is associated with fewer somatic mutations in cancer tissue. Mutations in TP53 are associated with lower DNAm age. To provide a glimpse of how DNAm age can inform cancer research, I relate it to several widely used genomic aberrations in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, GBM, and AML., DNAm age is arguably a promising marker for studying human development, aging, and cancer. It may become a useful surrogate marker for evaluating rejuvenation therapies. The most salient feature of DNAm age is its applicability to a broad spectrum of tissues and cell types. Since it allows one to contrast the ages of different tissues from the same subject, it can be used to identify tissues that show evidence of accelerated age due to disease (for example, cancer). It remains to be seen whether the DNAm age of easily accessible fluids/tissues (for example, saliva, buccal cells, blood, skin) can serve as a surrogate marker for inaccessible tissues (for example, brain, kidney, liver). It is noteworthy that DNAm age is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Given the high heritability of age acceleration in young subjects, I expect that age acceleration will mainly be a relevant measure in older subjects. Using a relatively small data set, I did not find any evidence that a premature aging disease (progeria) is associated with accelerated DNAm age (Figure 2T). In Additional file 2, I discuss whether DNAm age fulfils the biomarker criteria developed by the American Federation for Aging Research., Future research will need to clarify whether DNAm age is only a marker of aging or relates to an effector of aging. In conclusion, the epigenetic clock described here is likely to become a valuable addition to the telomere clock."
"32","Cell-cycle regulated transcription associates with DNA replication timing in yeast and human","Hunter B Fraser","Department of Biology, Stanford University","Hunter B Fraser","hbfraser@stanford.edu","7 October 2013","Eukaryotic DNA replication follows a specific temporal program, with some genomic regions consistently replicating earlier than others, yet what determines this program is largely unknown. Highly transcribed regions have been observed to replicate in early S-phase in all plant and animal species studied to date, but this relationship is thought to be absent from both budding yeast and fission yeast. No association between cell-cycle regulated transcription and replication timing has been reported for any species., Here I show that in budding yeast, fission yeast, and human, the genes most highly transcribed during S-phase replicate early, whereas those repressed in S-phase replicate late. Transcription during other cell-cycle phases shows either the opposite correlation with replication timing, or no relation. The relationship is strongest near late-firing origins of replication, which is not consistent with a previously proposed model—that replication timing may affect transcription—and instead suggests a potential mechanism involving the recruitment of limiting replication initiation factors during S-phase., These results suggest that S-phase transcription may be an important determinant of DNA replication timing across eukaryotes, which may explain the well-established association between transcription and replication timing.","","The timing of DNA replication during S-phase of the cell cycle plays an important role in genome integrity, the mutational spectrum, and a wide range of human diseases 
[1]. Despite many recent advances in our ability to measure the time of replication (Trep) across entire genomes 
[2–7], our understanding of what regulates this timing remains far from complete 
[1, 8–11]. The time at which origins of replication (ORIs) fire is thought to be determined in M-phase 
[12] or G1 
[13, 14], at which point factors such as Cdc45 and Sld3 bind to ORIs that will fire early in the following S-phase 
[15, 16]. These and several other proteins critical for replication initiation are present at copy-numbers lower than the number of ORIs 
[17–19], and their over-expression advances Trep for many late-firing ORIs in both budding and fission yeast 
[12, 17–20], suggesting that their re-use may be a key step in regulating ORI firing time. However, what determines the relative affinities of different ORIs for these limiting factors - and hence their temporal order of initiation - is largely unknown 
[19]., Among the strongest correlates (and potential determinants) of Trep in metazoans are transcriptional activity and chromatin state. Although transcriptionally active euchromatin has been known to replicate earlier than repressive heterochromatin for over 50 years 
[11, 21], the reason - and even the direction of causation - has remained elusive. The two major models 
[8, 11], not mutually exclusive, are that 1) the euchromatic chromatin structure is more permissive both to transcription and to DNA replication initiation, or 2) Trep itself affects chromatin structure and transcription as a result of changes in the nuclear milieu during S-phase. The former is most directly supported by experiments altering ORI firing time via manipulation of histone modifications 
[8–10, 18, 22–24], whereas the latter is supported by differences in chromatin and transcription of DNA templates injected into cells during either early or late S-phase 
[8, 9, 25, 26]., Measuring Trep genome-wide in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), Raghuraman et al. 
[2] reported a surprising lack of association between transcription and Trep (with the exception of the eight histone genes, which are highly transcribed in S phase and are replicated early). However, this analysis only involved clusters of co-expressed genes, and did not actually compare the highest- versus lowest-expressed genes. Nevertheless, it has been widely interpreted in the literature as indicating the absence of any association, and many authors have speculated as to why budding yeast lacks this relationship 
[5, 8–11]. Similarly, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) is thought to lack any association between transcription and replication timing 
[8], though again no systematic comparison has been reported., Because DNA replication is confined to a specific period during the cell cycle, I reasoned that the relationship between Trep and transcription may depend on when in the cell cycle transcription is occurring. The transcription of most genes does not vary greatly throughout the cell cycle, so cannot be used to determine phase-dependent effects. However, several hundred genes have been identified in both Sc and Sp for which transcription does vary consistently during the cell cycle 
[27, 28]. I compared the expression levels of these cell cycle-regulated genes measured in synchronized cells 
[27, 28] with the Trep for each gene to determine if any relationship exists. For both Sc and Sp expression levels measured in G2 phase, higher expression associated with earlier Trep (Figure 
1A). However, at other points in the cell cycle the relationship was quite different; mostly notably in M/G1 (Sc) or G1 (Sp), the relationship reversed, such that highly expressed genes were replicated late (Figure 
1A).

                        association varies by cell-cycle stage. (A) Comparing mean Trep of the top decile (10%) of most-induced versus most-repressed cell cycle-regulated genes reveals that genes highly expressed in G2 replicate early in both Sc and Sp, whereas those highly expressed in M/G1 (Sc) or G1 (Sp) replicate late (error bars represent the standard error). (B) The correlation between Trep and expression levels of known cell cycle-regulated genes was calculated separately for expression levels from each time point of cell cycle-synchronized time courses 
[27, 28]. An oscillation of the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) was observed for both budding yeast (all |r| > 0.107 are significant at P < 0.0025) and fission yeast (all |r| > 0.177 are at P < 0.0025). The approximate cell-cycle phase of each time point is shown 
[27, 28]. Similar oscillations are observed for other methods of synchronization as well (Additional file 
1: Figures S1 and S2). (C) A moving average of Trep is shown for all cell cycle-regulated genes, arranged in order of their time of maximal expression, beginning immediately following mitosis. A similar pattern is observed for both yeast species, with the latest Trep for genes with maximal transcript levels in G1, and the earliest Trep for genes with maximal transcript levels in G2.
                    , To more systematically visualize these patterns, I calculated the correlation between the expression levels of all cell cycle-regulated genes measured in synchronized cultures 
[27, 28] with their Trep, separately for each expression data time-point (see Materials and methods). Plotting these correlation coefficients as a function of the time at which the expression data were sampled, I found a striking relationship: both the strength and direction of the correlation oscillate as a function of cell-cycle stage (Figure 
1B). In these plots, positive r values represent time-points at which up-regulated genes tend to be replicated late in S phase; negative r values indicate times when up-regulated genes are replicated early. Consistent with the results in Figure 
1A, in both species of yeast, genes highly expressed in G2 phase are replicated early, while those expressed in late M/G1 are replicated late. The oscillation is observed regardless of the method used to achieve cell-cycle synchronization (Additional file 
1: Figures S1 and S2)., To further characterize this relationship, I plotted a moving average of Trep for the cell cycle-regulated genes in each species, ordered by their time of maximal expression. If expression in certain cell-cycle phases correlates with early or late replication, this should be reflected by troughs or peaks in such a plot. Again in both species a similar trend emerged: Trep reaches a maximum for genes expressed in G1, and a minimum for those expressed in G2 (Figure 
1C; Additional file 
1: Figure S3), consistent with the correlation analysis (Figure 
1B). The strong conservation of this pattern was surprising, considering how much the regulation of DNA replication has diverged in the hundreds of millions of years separating these two yeast lineages 
[29]., Although the strongest association between high mRNA levels and early replication was observed for G2-phase expression levels, it is important to note that this does not imply these genes are maximally transcribed in G2. Rather, one would expect maximal transcription to occur in the time leading up to the maximal transcript level, that is, in S phase. Indeed, plotting mRNA levels for G2-upregulated genes (those with early Trep in Figure 
1C), it is clear that their transcript levels show the greatest increase - likely reflecting active transcription - in S phase (Additional file 
1: Figure S4A). Likewise, genes with late Trep show the opposite pattern: maximal decrease in mRNA levels during S phase (Additional file 
1: Figure S4B)., The oscillating relationships shown in Figure 
1 do not establish whether Trep is more directly associated with transcription in S phase or in M phase. For example, if M-phase repression led to early Trep, S-phase induction could be associated with early Trep simply as an indirect consequence, because genes repressed in M phase are typically induced in S phase (Additional file 
1: Figure S4A). To disentangle the effects of S and M phases, I examined the Trep of genes that are expressed at similar levels throughout the cell cycle. If M-phase repression leads to early Trep, then genes repressed throughout the cell cycle would be expected to have early Trep, as a result of their repression in M phase (in this scenario, their S-phase expression levels are not relevant). However, if the association is instead due to S-phase induction, genes with constitutive high expression would have earlier Trep because of their active transcription in S phase (in which case M-phase expression levels would be irrelevant). This analysis showed a clear trend: highly expressed genes replicate 5.9 minutes earlier in Sc and 3.0 minutes earlier in Sp (Figure 
2). Therefore, the results shown in Figure 
1 can be entirely, and most parsimoniously, explained by the association of Trep with S-phase transcription; the M-phase relationship is likely to be an indirect side effect of this. This result also suggests a more general association between transcription and Trep in yeast that extends beyond cell cycle-regulated genes.

                        in budding and fission yeast. Comparison of the 100 highest-expressed genes with the 100 lowest-expressed shows that highly expressed genes are replicated earlier in both budding yeast and fission yeast. Error bars represent the standard error.
                    , To further investigate the connection between S-phase transcription and Trep, I tested whether the relationship differed for genes replicated during early versus late S phase. In this analysis I separated all cell cycle-regulated genes into 10 bins (that is, deciles) by their Trep, and plotted the median G2-phase transcript level (the time-point most closely reflecting S-phase transcription; Additional file 
1: Figure S4A) for each. Across all 10 Trep bins, I observed the expected relationship: decreasing expression of bins with increasing Trep (Figure 
3A). However, closer examination revealed that, for both yeast species, this pattern was almost entirely driven by late-replicating genes. In other words, there was no correlation between expression levels and Trep for genes in the first five bins (replicated in early S phase), while in late S phase the relationship was quite strong (Figure 
3A). Consistent with this, applying the correlation analysis from Figure 
1A to just early- or late-replicating genes revealed that the oscillation is entirely driven by replication in late S phase; genes with early Trep showed no oscillation, and only a weak correlation at nearly all time-points (Figure 
3B). These results parallel the finding in mouse that genes replicated in the second half of S phase show the strongest association between transcript levels and Trep[7].

                        association. (A) Median G2-phase transcript levels (representing S-phase transcription; Additional file 
1: Figure S4A) are shown for all cell cycle-regulated genes separated into 10 equally sized bins (deciles) by their Trep. For both yeast species, no correlation is observed for the first five bins, whereas a strong relationship is present for later Trep. (B) Consistent with the decile analysis, no oscillation is observed in the correlation between expression level and Trep for early Trep genes, while a strong oscillation is observed for late Trep genes. (C) Only weak oscillation is observed in the correlation between expression level and Trep for ORI-distal genes (>5 kb from the nearest ORI in budding yeast, or 10 kb in fission yeast), while a strong oscillation is observed for ORI-proximal genes.
                    , Another factor that may influence the relationship between S-phase transcription and replication timing is a gene’s distance from the nearest ORI. Under the model where chromatin affects both transcription and Trep, the strongest association would be expected for genes near ORIs, whereas if instead Trep affects a gene’s level of S-phase transcription, the relationship should be independent of distance to the nearest ORI 
[3]. Separating genes into two classes, ORI-proximal or ORI-distal, the ORI-proximal class showed far stronger oscillations (Figure 
3C; ORI distance cutoffs, chosen to result in approximately equal-sized lists, were 5 kb from the nearest ORI in Sc and 10 kb in Sp, due to the higher density of known ORIs in Sc; results from equal distance cutoffs are shown in Additional file 
1: Figure S5). Because ORI-proximal genes tend to be replicated earlier than ORI-distal genes, this result could not be an indirect effect of the stronger association for late Trep genes, as it acts in the opposite direction. This result suggests that the relationship is unlikely to be caused by an effect of Trep on S-phase transcription, which is one of the two major classes of models that have been proposed to explain the transcription/Trep association 
[8, 25, 26]., To test whether the relationship between S-phase transcription and replication timing is conserved outside of fungi, I applied the same correlation analysis to cell-cycle gene expression and Trep data from human HeLa cells 
[6, 30]. Analyzing all known HeLa cell-cycle regulated genes 
[30], I found no significant relationship of any kind (Figure 
4A). However, applying each of the two filters identified from yeast - late Trep and ORI proximity (within 10 kb) - resulted in clear and significant oscillations, of a magnitude similar to that observed for both yeast species (Figure 
4B,C). As observed for yeast, the minimum correlation (indicating early Trep of up-regulated genes) occurred in G2, and the maximum in late M/G1. The fact that the same oscillating relationship exists in human, and that its strength is influenced by the same two factors, suggests that it is likely to be caused by a mechanism conserved between fungi and metazoans.
                    Figure 4

                        in human. (A) No oscillation is observed when comparing the Trep versus expression levels of all cell cycle-regulated genes in HeLa cells (all |r| > 0.063 are significant at P < 0.05; the four time-points that exceed this are within the range expected by chance, given that 47 time-points were analyzed). (B) Significant oscillation is observed when comparing Trep versus expression levels of cell cycle-regulated genes with late Trep (red line; the final 50% of S phase; all |r| > 0.195 are significant), but not early Trep (blue line). (C) Significant oscillation is observed when comparing Trep versus expression levels of cell cycle-regulated genes within 10 kb of an ORI (blue line; all |r| > 0.197 are significant), but not further than 10 kb from an ORI (red line).
                    , To put into perspective the strength of the relationship between Trep and cell cycle-regulated gene expression in human, I compared it to the well-established association between Trep and average (asynchronous) gene expression. The latter provides a useful benchmark because it is regarded as a strong relationship that has been observed in numerous studies across diverse metazoans 
[5, 6, 8, 9]. To facilitate a direct comparison with the results in Figure 
4, I used the same Trep data 
[6] for the same genes, but replaced the cell cycle-synchronized gene expression data 
[30] with high-coverage RNA-seq data from asynchronous HeLa cells 
[31]. The correlation between asynchronous expression and Trep was r = -0.16 for late Trep genes (the genes represented by the red line in Figure 
4B) and r = -0.15 for ORI-proximal genes (represented by the blue line in Figure 
4C). In both cases, the asynchronous data explained less than a third of the variance in Trep that is explained by S-phase transcription (see Materials and methods). Differing quality of the two gene expression data sets 
[30, 31] could contribute to this difference; however, because RNA-seq is of far higher precision than spotted cDNA microarrays 
[32], any difference would likely underestimate the strength of the cell-cycle oscillations (Figure 
4). These results suggest that the relationship between Trep and S-phase transcription in human is substantially stronger than the well-established association with asynchronous expression., These results suggest that 1) S-phase transcription is associated with DNA replication timing in budding yeast, fission yeast, and human; 2) the association is strongest for genomic regions near ORIs, excluding the causal model in which Trep affects transcription 
[8, 9, 25, 26]; 3) it is also strongest for regions replicated in late S phase, implying that early-firing ORIs are not affected by this relationship; and 4) this association explains at least three times more of the variability in Trep than the well-known association with (asynchronous) gene expression in human., Although the replication of these patterns across three species (and across multiple data sets within species; Additional file 
1: Figures S1 and S2) lends confidence to their robustness, several caveats should be considered. First, gene expression was represented by transcript abundances, which is a function of both transcription and mRNA decay; therefore, the correlations reported here may underestimate the relationship between transcription and Trep. This prediction can be tested once rates of transcription have been measured throughout the cell cycle. Second, data quality is critical in any analysis; poor-quality data can reduce, or entirely mask, a real relationship. However, in most analyses reported here this is not a major concern, because it could only make the current results conservative (one exception to this is the ORI-proximal versus distal analyses (Figures 
3C and 
4C): if Trep was measured more accurately near ORIs, this would lead to stronger ORI-proximal correlations, although additional analysis suggests this is not the case (see Materials and methods)). Third, correlation does not imply causation. Although the evidence does not support a model where Trep affects transcription (Figures 
3C and 
4C), I cannot determine whether transcription itself is affecting Trep, or whether unobserved (latent) factors may be involved. With this caveat in mind, I believe there is still sufficient evidence to propose a testable model to account for these data., A plausible mechanism explaining these observations draws from the finding that the firing of ORIs in late S phase is governed by recruitment of limiting replication initiation factors 
[12, 17–20]. These factors are sequestered by early-firing ORIs from G1 until early S phase, and are reused at late-firing ORIs after their release from early-firing ORIs. I propose that the level of S-phase transcription near a late-firing ORI reflects local chromatin accessibility and/or subnuclear positioning, and in turn the ability of ORIs to recruit these limiting factors during S phase (Figure 
5). This model accounts for the relationship of Trep with S-phase transcription (and the differing relationships in other phases); for the relationship being strongest near late-firing ORIs; and for the inferred direction of causality (that is, Trep not being causal).
                    Figure 5
                      
                                    A model to explain these observations. Components: ORC and MCM2-7 are protein complexes comprising the pre-replicative complex. Blue cylinders represent nucleosomes, with dark blue indicating closed/repressive chromatin and light blue indicating open/accessible chromatin. Red proteins are limiting replication initiation factors (such as Cdc45 and Sld3). Txn = transcription. Sequence of events: in G1 (not depicted), the limiting replication initiation factors (red circles) associate with the earliest-firing ORIs (top row). When S phase begins, these early ORIs fire and release the factors, which are then free to associate with other ORIs (though note that Cdc45 is a component of the replication fork, so can only be recycled after fork termination). The relative affinities of the remaining ORIs for these factors - and thus their relative firing times - are determined by the chromatin state near the ORI during S-phase. ORIs near genes highly transcribed in S phase (middle row) have an accessible chromatin structure and thus high affinity, so will tend to fire earlier than those with little nearby S-phase transcription and thus less accessible chromatin (bottom row). Although not shown here, subnuclear positioning could help determine ORI accessibility, either by influencing chromatin structure or through other mechanisms. Figure adapted from 
[19].
                    , The proposed mechanism likely acts in concert with other factors determining Trep, and thus is not inconsistent with evidence supporting these other factors. For example, although the determination of early versus late-firing ORIs is completed during M/G1 
[12–14], S-phase transcription may still influence firing time specifically at late-firing ORIs (Figure 
5)., Future work integrating these results with other (non-mutually-exclusive) mechanisms affecting Trep - for example, Forkhead transcription factors 
[33] and subnuclear positioning 
[8, 29, 34, 35] - may lead to a unified framework for understanding the causes, and consequences, of the temporal program of DNA replication across eukaryotes."

However, significant biases introduced by RNA ligation in current protocols lead to inaccurate miRNA quantification by 1000-fold. Here we report an RNA cloning method that achieves over 95% efficiency for both 5′ and 3′ ligations. It achieves accurate quantification of synthetic miRNAs with less than two-fold deviation from the anticipated value and over a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude. Taken together, this high-efficiency RNA cloning method permits accurate genome-wide miRNA profiling from total RNAs., MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (approximately 20 to 22 nucleotides), non-coding RNA species that are broadly expressed in almost all eukaryotes. They regulate diverse biological processes by targeting a large number of protein-coding mRNA transcripts [1]. The widespread regulation of mRNAs by miRNAs is supported by the evidence obtained from computational analysis [2, 3], transcriptome analysis [4, 5] and proteome profiling [6, 7]. With recent developments in quantitative mRNA profiling, it is estimated that the median copy number of an mRNA is 17 molecules, and the dynamic range for mRNA copy number is approximately 104 in a single mammalian cell [8, 9]. Because miRNAs regulate mRNA expression in a stoichiometric manner [10, 11] and a conserved miRNA is predicted to recognize approximately 400 target sites [1, 12], such broad variation in mRNA expression suggests miRNAs could differentially regulate highly or lowly expressed mRNAs. Indeed, it was recently demonstrated that miRNAs could function either as a switch or a fine-tuner, depending on the copy number of both miRNAs and their cognate mRNA targets [10]. Adding to the complexity of miRNA-mediated regulation, other RNA species, including competing endogenous mRNAs or circular RNAs, were recently shown to function as a molecular decoy by titrating miRNAs from their functional mRNA targets [13–16]. Collectively, these studies suggest that a highly expressed miRNA is capable of regulating many more mRNA targets and/or repressing mRNA targets more potently than a lowly expressed miRNA within a cell. Therefore, these findings highlight the importance of accurately determining the relative expression levels of different miRNAs in a given cellular context., Three major platforms, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), microarray and small RNA cloning followed by deep sequencing (miRNA-Seq), have been developed for genome-wide miRNA profiling. However, both qRT-PCR and microarray platforms are hybridization-based techniques suitable only for known miRNAs and are unable to provide single-nucleotide resolution for miRNA detection. Furthermore, due to the limitation of probe design for such a short sequence of miRNAs, absolute quantification of individual miRNAs requires extensive optimization and individual internal controls [17]. In contrast, with the rapid development of next-generation sequencing techniques, miRNA-Seq has the potential to provide single-nucleotide resolution of miRNA species, facilitate de novo miRNA discovery, and offer nearly unlimited dynamic range for miRNA quantification [18]. The enthusiasm towards miRNA-Seq, however, has been severely dampened by the identification of significant biases introduced during small RNA cDNA library preparation, often more than three orders of magnitude for individual miRNAs [19, 20]. Although the cloning biases are likely caused by many factors, the RNA ligation has been identified as one of the major sources [20]. Consistent with this view, recent studies with modifications to the ligation reactions have shown some promise to reduce the cloning bias [21–23]. However, a highly effective method for genome-wide miRNA quantification by deep sequencing has yet to be successfully developed., In this study, we investigate the highly biased miRNA quantification by current miRNA-Seq methods with 29 representative miRNAs. We demonstrate that inefficient and biased RNA ligation for both 3′ and 5′ adapter ligation is the major contributing factor for the inaccurate quantification. To develop an unbiased RNA cloning protocol, we have performed extensive tests with multiple customized adapters, RNA ligases as well as ligation conditions. As a result, we have established an RNA cloning strategy that allows nearly 100% ligation efficiency for both 3′ and 5′ ligation steps. When applied to a pool of either equimolar or differentially mixed synthetic miRNAs, our method achieves less than two-fold deviation from the expected results for each miRNA. We further demonstrate that the unbiased cloning is applicable to complex RNA mixtures using Caenorhabditis elegans total RNA with the synthetic mix spiked in. Finally, we apply our method to biological samples isolated from multiple mouse tissues as well as HeLa cells. Our results provide a quantitative view of miRNA expression for each of these samples. These data also reveal that most cistronic miRNAs that are derived from a single transcript are expressed at similar levels, and that miRNAs repress their target expression in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, we have established a highly efficient miRNA-Seq method that accurately quantifies individual miRNAs whose expression levels are across four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the optimized RNA ligation can be readily applied to other RNA ligation-based RNA-Seq methods to provide quantitative insights for RNA transcripts., In this study, we have developed a highly efficient miRNA-Seq method to quantify individual miRNAs within a biological sample (Figure 7E). Although the RNA-ligase-introduced bias has been widely recognized [19–22], a systematic solution generally applicable for a broad spectrum of small RNA substrates has not previously been developed. Such a bias, often leading to more than 1,000-fold deviation, has significantly hindered the utilization of miRNA-Seq for quantitative miRNA profiling in a high-throughput manner. Although in some studies the sequencing depth has approached billions of reads [33], the power of accurate quantification of miRNAs based on the cloning frequency remains poor [20]. Because intermolecular RNA hybridization contributes to bias, the application of a thermostable RNA ligase or a 5′ splint adapter significantly reduces such bias. However, the ligation efficiency is low and the improvement by each strategy appears to vary for different RNA substrates. By examining individual steps during the small RNA cDNA library preparation, we have defined optimal conditions to achieve high ligation efficiency for both 3′ and 5′ ligation steps. We determined that the nucleotide composition of the linkers, the concentration of linkers, molecular crowding through the use of PEG8000, and ligation temperature are the primary determinants for highly efficient RNA ligation. We demonstrated with a wide spectrum of small RNA substrates that the ligation efficiency can approach 100%, a drastic improvement compared with the existing method. As a result, the high-efficiency RNA cloning leads to quantitative measurement of miRNAs by miRNA-Seq. To achieve such quantitative results for a pool of approximately 700 miRNAs for a single sample, we usually need approximately 4 to 5 million reads. With the data output routinely over 200 million reads from a single lane of a sequencer, in combination with the multiplexing capacity of the Illumina Hi-Seq platform, our miRNA-Seq method provides an extremely cost-effective and accurate approach for large scale miRNA analyses from numerous samples., The ability to measure relative expression levels of different miRNAs within a single sample also offers an important approach to identify functionally significant miRNAs. Conventional gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR and microarray usually characterizes differential expression levels of individual miRNAs and identifies miRNAs with the largest fold changes from two or more samples. With the detection sensitivity of qRT-PCR approaching single molecules, some very lowly expressed miRNAs could be identified as highly differentially expressed, though their biological importance may be limited due to low copy number. Since miRNAs function by guiding the RNA-induced silencing complex to their cognate mRNAs and sequestering the mRNAs from productive translation [51], the ratio between miRNAs and mRNA targets is a key factor in determining the potency of a miRNA [10]. In support of this, we demonstrate that the most highly expressed miRNA in HeLa cells, miR-21, has the highest capacity to repress the reporter expression, and the intermediately and lowly expressed ones (for example, miR-130a and miR-502) show much weaker repression. Thus, functionally important miRNAs could be identified as the most highly expressed miRNAs within a cellular context without the knowledge of differential expression patterns. Interestingly, in our analysis of miRNAs in both brain and heart, we observed that a small number (approximately 10) of miRNAs count for a major portion of the miRNA pool. This raises a possibility that the function of the miRNA pathway could be mediated by a handful of highly expressed miRNAs in each cell population., Finally, our approach to enhance RNA ligation efficiency offers a general guide to improve all RNA ligation-based RNA-Seq methods. The enhanced ligation not only reduces the required amount of RNA input but also, more importantly, improves the representation of different RNA species/fragments in the sequencing libraries. These improvements will allow quantitative analysis of gene expression by fully harnessing the power of deep sequencing."

Epidemiological studies indicate that adverse intrauterine and postnatal environments have a long-lasting role in chronic kidney disease development. Epigenetic information represents a plausible carrier for mediating this programming effect. Here we demonstrate that genome-wide cytosine methylation patterns of healthy and chronic kidney disease tubule samples obtained from patients show significant differences., We identify differentially methylated regions and validate these in a large replication dataset. The differentially methylated regions are rarely observed on promoters, but mostly overlap with putative enhancer regions, and they are enriched in consensus binding sequences for important renal transcription factors. This indicates their importance in gene expression regulation. A core set of genes that are known to be related to kidney fibrosis, including genes encoding collagens, show cytosine methylation changes correlating with downstream transcript levels., Our report raises the possibility that epigenetic dysregulation plays a role in chronic kidney disease development via influencing core pro-fibrotic pathways and can aid the development of novel biomarkers and future therapeutics.","","Clinical retrospective data indicate that altered nutrient availability during development could have a long lasting effect on the development of adult diseases, a phenomenon called 'programming'. Hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) show one of the highest sensitivities to intrauterine programming [1]. Epigenetic changes caused by altered intrauterine nutrient availability have been proposed as the mechanistic link for hypertension and CKD development [2]. Epigenetic modifications are inherited during cell division, thus solidifying 'the memory or programming' effects of the environment [3]. The epigenome, which includes the covalent modifications of DNA and its associated proteins and defines DNA accessibility to the transcriptional machinery, is the key determinant of outcome after transcription factor binding. At the root of the epigenetic modifications is the direct chemical modification of cytosines by methylation [4]. In different cancer types, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters has been observed [5]. Increased promoter methylation can interfere with transcription factor binding, causing loss of tumor suppressor expression, thereby contributing to the malignant transformation [6, 7]. Agents that reduce cytosine methylation (for example, azacytidine) are now in clinical use and are associated with improvements in clinical outcome, especially for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome [8]. In addition, mutations of different chromatin-modifying enzymes have been described in various cancer types, contributing to alterations in the cancer epigenome [9]., Not much is known about the epigenome of chronic human diseases other than cancer. Most previous studies have been performed on cultured cells, animal models, or surrogate cell types (mostly circulating mononuclear cells) [10]. As the epigenome is cell type-specific, little mechanistic information can be drawn from cultured cells and surrogate cell types [11]. To understand whether or not epigenetic changes occur and thereby potentially contribute to CKD development in patients, we performed genome-wide cytosine methylation profiling of tubule epithelial cells obtained from CKD and control kidneys. We found that core fibrosis-related genes show cytosine methylation changes in their gene regulatory regions. In vitro studies indicate that cytosine methylation differences play a role in regulating transcript expression. Examining the CKD epigenome can be an important first step in understanding the role of epigenetics outside the cancer field [12]., While epigenetic dysregulation has been suggested as a mechanism for the development of many diseases, little is known about the epigenome of normal and diseased human cells and organs. Here we describe cytosine methylation differences in tubule cells obtained from patients with CKD. We found that CKD DMRs have many special features. First, most loci showed consistent cytosine methylation differences in different forms of CKD. These changes were smaller compared with what has described in the cancer literature previously. While the absolute differences were modest, the identified loci showed highly consistent changes even across different datasets and platforms. Unexpectedly, we found that most methylation differences localized outside of promoter areas, with promoter regions markedly spared from cytosine methylation differences. Our results indicate that the differentially methylated regions were located mainly at candidate enhancers. We found that the DMRs contain consensus-binding motifs for key renal transcription factors (HNF, TCFAP, SIX2). Furthermore, cytosine methylation levels correlated with baseline gene expression changes. These epigenetically distinct but morphologically similar cells also showed differences in their cytokine response. We illustrated our findings in a model hypothesizing that enhancer DMRs might modify transcription factor binding and thereby downstream transcript levels., Based on our results, we propose that cytosine methylation changes are causally linked to transcript levels and phenotype development. As hypertensive and diabetic tubule samples showed similarities (both in cytosine methylation and gene expression changes), the observed changes are likely to be part of a common mechanism of progression. This may be expected, as phenotypically the tubulointerstitial fibrosis of DKD and hypertensive CKD is similar. In addition, we found that DMRs were enriched for genes related to development, many of them no longer expressed in the adult kidney. The DMR regions also contained binding sites for key kidney developmental factors (such as SIX2, HNF, and TCFAP). One possible interpretation of our findings is that the epigenetic differences are established during development. This is the time when the cell type-specific epigenome is established and when these genes and transcription factors play functional roles. Therefore they can possibly provide the mechanistic link between fetal programming and CKD development - the Brenner-Barker hypothesis put forward many decades ago [26, 27], proposing that nutrient availability during development has a long lasting programming role in hypertension and CKD development. In addition, reactivation of the developmental pathways is also needed during organ injury repair [28]. We can also speculate that the altered developmental wiring of these pathways could continue to play a role later on as alterations observed after repair. Indeed, control and CKD kidney epithelial cells showed not only cytosine methylation differences but also different responses to cytokine treatment., A limitation of our results remains that our samples were collected in a single center. Furthermore, base pair resolution results will likely help to refine the more precise location of DMRs and the methylation differences in the future. Furthermore, while microdissection is an excellent separation method to generate a homogenous tubular epithelial cell population from the kidney, the potential risk for increased cell type heterogeneity in CKD remains. As isolated and cultured cells continued to show many of the epigenetic and transcriptional differences, it is more likely that the observed differences are not related to cell type heterogeneity., In summary, while it has long been speculated that epigenetic dysregulation might occur in non-cancerous diseases, including CKD, here we provide experimental evidence for cytosine methylation changes in human kidney tissue samples, opening the possibility that they play a role in CKD development."

              , Analysis of the massive quantity of data generated by next-generation sequencing has given us a new appreciation of the complexity of the transcriptome, and has also shed light on the more than 90% of the genome that was previously thought not to have critical functions. Among these findings is the realization that a large number of noncoding RNAs map to extra- and intragenic regulatory elements known as enhancers, and that the expression of such noncoding transcripts has important functional consequences in transcriptional regulation [1–4]. However, non-enhancer classes of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) may fulfill other functions in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. These transcripts are predominantly polyadenylated and processed by the splicing machinery. Importantly, many of these lincRNAs are targeted by specific transcription factors responding to critical cellular signaling pathways., The prevailing theory regarding the mechanism of action of many nuclear lincRNAs stipulates their association with chromatin regulatory complexes, providing additional binding energy for their targeting to specific genomic loci; indeed, a number of lincRNAs have recently been shown to exhibit chromatin-binding behavior as a mechanism of gene regulation. In this issue of Genome Biology, Marín-Béjar et al.[5] identify a lincRNA termed tumor protein 53 (p53)-induced noncoding transcript (Pint) that associates with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and regulates transcription., p53 has been heralded as the gatekeeper of the genome in human cancers, owing to the large number of tumors that display mutations in this transcription factor. A significant effort has therefore been directed toward understanding the direct targets of p53 transcriptional regulation and elucidating the cellular pathways that such p53 targets control. Recent studies have uncovered long noncoding RNAs as novel targets of p53 tumor suppression [6, 7]. Marín-Béjar et al. used custom tiling microarrays in a mouse model system to identify lincRNAs that are regulated by p53. This analysis resulted in the identification of Pint, a lincRNA with multiple isoforms., Subsequent experiments focused on the longest Pint isoform containing four exons, which displayed a high level of expression in most tissues examined. Analysis of the genomic locus of Pint revealed three p53 binding sites: a promoter-proximal binding site and two distal binding sites a few hundred thousand base pairs from the transcriptional start site. Functional analysis revealed that p53 binds to these regulatory sites and mediates the activation of Pint following induction of p53., To assess Pint functions, Marin-Bejar et al. depleted Pint levels using antisense oligos, and measured cellular growth before and after induction of DNA damage. Pint depletion led to decreased cellular proliferation, which was more prominent following DNA damage induction. Remarkably, overexpression of Pint led to an increase in cellular growth, strongly suggesting a trans-mediated mechanism of action for Pint in controlling proliferation. An analysis of the consequences of Pint depletion, on the other hand, demonstrated that lowering Pint concentration causes an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in the fraction of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. As expected, overexpression of Pint had opposite effects on apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Importantly, manipulation of Pint levels had similar effects in multiple mouse cell types, suggesting a general mechanism of action for regulation of cellular growth., To gain further insight into the mechanism by which Pint regulates proliferation, Marín-Béjar et al. depleted Pint levels following the induction of DNA damage and analyzed gene expression changes using a microarray platform. Consistent with the role of mouse Pint in the regulation of proliferation, gene expression changes in pathways regulating cellular growth and survival were uncovered, including TGF-β and MAPK pathways. Changes in gene expression were also observed in transcripts regulated by the p53 pathway. Indeed, depletion of p53 resulted in changes in gene expression that partially overlapped that of Pint depletion. Marín-Béjar et al. surmised that such gene expression changes are mediated in trans, given that the neighboring genes did not display changes in their expression following depletion of Pint, although the gene expression changes following overexpression of Pint were not analyzed., It would be informative to know whether Pint overexpression induces opposing changes in gene expression to those seen following its depletion. Such overexpression experiments would also allow for detailed structure/function analysis of Pint with regard to gene expression and cellular proliferation., To gain insight into the molecular basis of Pint transcriptional regulatory function, Marín-Béjar et al. examined its association with PRC2. The current model for the targeting of PRC2 implicates noncoding RNAs in the recruitment of this complex to its genomic sites [8–10]. Pint was found to be highly enriched in the nucleus and to associate directly with the PRC2 complex. Moreover, depletion of Pint resulted in decreased chromatin residence of PRC2 at a subset of Pint-regulated genes displaying histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, a mark of transcriptional repression., To mechanistically link the PRC2 complex and changes in cellular proliferation by altering Pint levels, Marín-Béjar et al. examined the consequences of Pint manipulation in 3T3 cells in which the Ezh2 subunit of PRC2 was depleted. Whereas overexpression of Pint in control cells promoted growth, increased expression of Pint in the absence of PRC2 did not significantly affect cellular proliferation. These results point to a critical role for PRC2 in mediating the growth regulatory function of Pint. It is important to note that although Pint may cooperate with PRC2 at a subset of its targets, it is likely that other chromatin regulators may also associate with Pint and its scope of interaction with chromatin regulatory complexes may be much larger than PRC2 alone., Having established functional and molecular characteristics of Pint in a mouse model, Marín-Béjar et al. turned their attention to the analysis of a possible homolog of Pint in human cells (PINT), initially identified on the basis of synteny with the mouse genome. It has often been difficult to discern the evolutionary conservation of lincRNAs, given that the evolutionary pressures maintained through codon usage in protein-coding genes are not present. However, in most cases the overall genomic position and short stretches of sequence conservation are preserved among close mammalian species. Indeed, small patches of PINT 5′-end sequences have homology with the mouse Pint. Moreover, similar to mouse Pint, human PINT is regulated by p53 through proximal and distal genomic binding sites., But the functional conservation between human PINT and mouse Pint turned out to be only at a superficial level. Surprisingly, human PINT overexpression suppressed cellular proliferation, an opposite effect to that seen with mouse Pint. Indeed, analysis of a panel of human colorectal tumors revealed a significant downregulation in PINT, consistent with a role in tumor suppression. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that PINT may function as a critical target of p53 in cancer cells and may contribute to the tumor suppressive function of p53 in human cancers., We are at the very early stages of our functional understanding of lincRNAs and noncoding RNAs in general. There is much to learn about the biogenesis pathway of lincRNAs and their mechanism of action. Clearly, the current work on Pint has begun to shed light on the biological function of lincRNAs in cellular proliferation and DNA damage response through the p53 protein, in this case, intriguingly, as a mediator of p53 autoregulation. The next steps will entail the genetic dissection of Pint in model organisms and a greater insight into the sequence or structural requirements in Pint that govern interactions with PRC2 and other chromatin regulatory complexes. These are high times for the study of long noncoding RNAs as the new players in town regulating mammalian gene expression."

Kenji Murakami (Stanford University, USA) presented a cryo-EM structure of the yeast PIC with all GTFs bound. Predicted positions of GTFs were supported by cross-linking and mass spectrometry data computationally fit to a coarse-resolution model of the PIC. The human and yeast PIC structures showed a surprising number of differences, most centered around the location of Transcription factor II human (TFIIH) and positioning of downstream DNA. Steve Hahn (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, USA) presented a characterization of the enzymatic activities of TFIIH. Purified TFIIH was shown to lack the 3′-5′ helicase activity ascribed to its Ssl2 subunit (yeast XPB) - the ATPase subunit required for promoter opening. In contrast, TFIIH possessed an Ssl2-dependent DNA translocase activity, supporting a model where TFIIH pumps DNA into the Pol II active site. Since TFIIH and upstream DNA are constrained in the PIC, its translocase activity torsionally strains DNA, resulting in unwinding within the Pol II active site., Richard Ebright (Rutgers University, USA) addressed the basic enzymatic mechanism of initiation using Thermus thermophilus RNA polymerase (RNAP). In an amazing series of crystal structures, he revealed the first steps of transcript synthesis, including interactions of conserved RNAP residues with a pair of dNTP substrates prior to the first phosphodiester bond formation. Crystals containing several short RNA products also allowed direct observation of non-template DNA scrunching. Speaking of beautiful crystal structures, Patrick Cramer (Gene Center Munich, Germany) surprised the meeting participants with a new Pol I structure exhibiting a splayed DNA cleft that was too big for a double helix. This widening appeared to cause a change, compared with Pol II, which propagated to the active site that would prevent substrate binding. Conformational flexibility of this type has previously been observed for bacterial RNAPs but only now in a eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Cramer also presented a genomic analysis of how Nrd1/Nab3 non-coding RNA binding was likely embedded in sequence throughout the genome to terminate antisense transcription entering coding and non-coding regions, as well as divergent transcription from gene promoters., Regulation of elongation focused on identification of new players. Heeyoun Bunch (Harvard Medical School, USA) used an immobilized template with a paused gene, human HSPA1B, to pull down TRIM28, a factor with previously identified roles in chromatin remodeling. Knockdown of the factor affected the expression of several paused genes, and redistributed Pol II to the gene body genome-wide, pointing to a pausing stabilization role. Building on previous work, Qiang Zhou (UC Berkeley, USA) found that AFF1, a central scaffolding protein for the super elongation complex (SEC), promotes HIV transcriptional elongation, at least in part, by enhancing P-TEFb extraction from the 7SK snRNP by the viral encoded Tat protein., Consistent with multiple functions of the AFF family (AFF1–4), Ali Shilatifard (Stowers Institute for Medical Research, USA) described work showing that P-TEFb-containing complexes demonstrated higher levels of activity than P-TEFb alone towards the Pol II carboxy-terminal domain, identifying SECs as the most active versions of P-TEFb. In addition to these factors, Monsef Benkirane (Institut Genetique Humaine, France) was able to show that the Integrator complex, which is better known for processing snRNA 3′ ends, regulates NELF-mediated Pol II pausing at protein coding genes. ChIP analyses show that Integrator associates with the transcriptional start site (TSS) of its target genes together with NELF, DSIF and Pol II. Knockdown of the Integrator catalytic subunit results in pause release and enhanced elongation by Pol II. However, Integrator also appears to be required for proper termination by Pol II. Thus, pause release and elongation are control points regulated by a number of factors., Underscoring unexpected roles and mechanisms for known factors, work from David Price (University of Iowa, USA) and David Levens (National Cancer Institute, USA) examined the role of the oncogenic transcription factor Myc. David Levens demonstrated that Myc caused a global amplification of transcription in activated B cells with only a modest bonus at genes containing its cognate E-box binding site. David Price asserted that the genomic distribution of Myc suggested that the transcription machinery, rather than specific sequences, are the driving force for Myc occupancy. It remains to be seen how dispensable sequence-specific DNA binding is for Myc, and whether such promiscuity is widespread among other transcription factor families., Two elegant biochemical studies revealed how reading multiple nucleosomes affects chromatin. Bing Li (UT Southwestern, USA) and Geeta Narlikar (UC San Francisco, USA) each used di-nucleosome substrates to probe how the modification status of one nucleosome affects the modification of another. Bing Li presented an intriguing model in which recognition of a dinucleosome and its spacing contributes to control of the Rpd3 deacetylase in yeast. Narlikar presented an exquisite mechanism of how multiple chromodomain containing proteins collaborate to form, maintain, or expand repressive heterochromatin using different factors (HP1 and Suv39/Clr4). She showed that despite recognizing the same methylated residue on nucleosomes (histone 3 lysine 9; H3K9), differential preferences for di- as opposed to tri-methyl states allowed the factors to collaborate rather than compete. It is likely that more interactions between differently modified nucleosomes and accessory proteins will reveal a level of regulation of transcription bewildering in both its subtlety and complexity., Chromatin immunoprecipitation has become a standard tool in localizing transcription factors and chromatin modifications, with ChIP-seq allowing genome-wide analyses. Associations between co-localized factors have given great insight into functional relationships, while identifying new transcription factors. Colocalization of unexpected protein partners on target genes was evident in the discovery by Kathy Jones and colleagues (Salk Institute, USA) of α-catenin functioning in a complex interplay with β-catenin as a transcriptional regulator when found on Wnt-pathway transcriptional targets. In addition, Jerry Workman (Stowers Institute for Medical Research, USA) described his group’s identification of a Drosophila Hsc70 chaperone complex that localizes to specific genes and shows transcription factor-related effects. Both talks illustrated that the bounds of what factors might function in transcription need to be reconsidered., In a striking piece of work, Rick Young (Whitehead Institute, USA) also used ChIP-seq signals of an active enhancer mark, H3K27Ac, in large (more than 10 kb) domains to further identify their recently defined ‘super enhancers’ in a large panel of cell lines. Super enhancers contain high levels of numerous transcription factors and appear to be associated with master regulator genes required for cell-type identity. He also showed that these super enhancers in cancer lines are biomarkers for specific cancer types. Super enhancers appear to have bistable properties, and were significantly impaired by the inhibition of one cofactor, Brd4. How super enhancers are specified and evolve, and what relationships they have to cellular transformation remain to be elucidated., Despite the clear utility of ChIP-seq, several labs have pushed to enhance the technique. Frank Pugh (Penn State, USA) continued his work coupling traditional ChIP-seq with an exonuclease digestion step (ChIP-exo) to prune the 5′ ends of each DNA strand down to a site of crosslinking. This increases resolution, and enabled a detailed examination of GTF localization in human cells by Brian Venters from the Pugh lab (now at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, USA) to identify core promoters. He found signatures of TATA elements and associated BRE sequences at most TFIIB ChIP-exo peaks, with elements exhibiting a stereotypical pattern among genes with highly diverse regulation. In an exciting development, David Auble (University of Virginia School of Medicine, USA) demonstrated that by measuring the ChIP signal of a transcription factor over a time course of exposure to crosslinking agent (seconds to minutes), the dynamics of site-specific binding could be inferred. This technique, termed crosslinking kinetic analysis, will help to explore the relationship between DNA-bound transcription factor turnover and transcriptional potency, competition and cooperativity among transcription factors, and gene expression timing. Furthermore, he demonstrated that a large dynamic range of signal is lost during long crosslinking times and how observed occupancy by ChIP for factors might be highly misleading., An evolution of the Hi-C approach used in Bing Ren’s lab (UC San Diego, USA), employing ultra-deep sequencing and new analysis methods to identify interactions between distant sequences, showed a surprising level of stability within what he termed ‘topological domains’ in human embryonic stem cells, which remained largely intact through development. Interestingly, two proteins thought to shape these boundaries, Cohesin and CTCF, were found to have distinct effects., Two techniques illustrated subtleties of transcription only evident upon single-cell analyses. Single-cell RNA FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) experiments performed in Jane Mellor’s lab (Oxford University, UK) pointed to a mechanistic link between antisense transcription and the behavior of sense-strand gene transcription. Her data suggested that sense and antisense transcription did not occur simultaneously, and that antisense transcription ‘reset’ the chromatin for transcription in the sense direction. The resulting back and forth resulted in increased noise or ‘bursts’ of sense transcription. Bursting was also observed in the early Drosophila embryo. In beautiful movies of live embryos shown by Michael Levine (UC Berkeley, USA), flickering or bursting transcription was observed for the promoter of the thisbe gene, which only weakly supports Pol II pausing, thus driving reporter expression. Promoters with strongly paused Pol II suppressed bursting, showing more even rates of mRNA production in similar experiments. These experiments indicate additional differences between strongly Pol II-pausing promoters and weakly pausing ones, which already have shown differences in stochasticity of on versus off states between embryonic nuclei. The core promoter thus may specify important additional properties of gene expression., It is clear from these presentations, and many additional stories, that the CSHL Eukaryotic Transcription meeting occupies an important niche that draws from innovative genome scale experiments to study fundamental transcriptional mechanisms. We hope this focus continues and serves as a magnet to attract transcription researchers from all over the world."

              , Extensive control of eukaryotic gene expression is exerted at the elongation phase of transcription by Pol II [1]. Control of Pol II elongation is characterized by the default action of negative elongation factors, which include 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF), negative elongation factor (NELF), Gdown1, Gdown1 negative accessory factor (GNAF) and transcription factor IIS (TFIIS). The combined action of these factors generates promoter-proximal paused Pol II, which is found engaged in transcription - but held within the first 100 bp - of approximately one-half of mammalian genes. The transition into productive elongation requires the kinase activity of P-TEFb, which causes phosphorylation of DSIF and the loss of NELF. A new set of factors subsequently become associated with Pol II, which then displays a high elongation rate. At the same time, the site of phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of the large subunit of Pol II changes from predominately Ser5 to Ser2. Productive elongation complexes facilitate the efficient processing of nascent transcripts into mature mRNAs. Finally, once Pol II passes the polyadenylation site at the 3' end of the transcribed gene, it slows and then terminates, and Pol II and the polyadenylated mRNA are then released., Because of the prevalence of promoter-proximal paused Pol II and the ability of P-TEFb to cause the transition into productive elongation, metazoans have evolved a unique mechanism for the control of P-TEFb [1]. In rapidly growing cells, most of the P-TEFb population is held in an inactive state by an interaction with hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HEXIM) inducible proteins in the 7SK snRNP. Active P-TEFb is released from the snRNP when, and likely where, it is needed and can be returned to the snRNP as genes are shut down [3]. By means of an unknown mechanism, P-TEFb is globally released by actinomycin D, ultraviolet light, P-TEFb inhibitors or any treatment that inhibits Pol II elongation. This sudden release leads to a transient increase in transcription of many genes that were previously occupied with paused Pol II. Global release of P-TEFb can also be triggered by knockdown of the 7SK snRNA, as used by Castelo-Branco et al., or of factors that stabilize the 7SK snRNA [4]., To study the global effects of 7SK repression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Castelo-Branco et al.[2] collected very deep, strand-specific, RNA-seq datasets 6 hours after knockdown using two different small interfering RNAs against 7SK. Analysis of the data revealed an unusual pattern of RNA expression caused by knockdown of 7SK; however, because the pattern of RNA signals is dominated by exons found in stable mRNAs, the global differences between the two conditions were subtle. This can be seen in the UCSC Genome Browser tracks of the forward reads before and after knockdown displayed in the top two rows of Figure 1a (compare ‘Control for’ with ‘7SK KD for’; the data displayed are for a small interfering RNA targeting the 3' region of 7SK).

                        RNA. (a) UCSC Genome Browser tracks of a representative 6 million bp region showing the original control and 7SK knockdown RNA-Seq datasets from Castelo-Branco et al.[2]. The top two tracks show only the forward direction, with transcription proceeding toward the right. As described in the text, these two tracks were fed into a bioinformatics pipeline that included a subtraction of the control data from the 7SK knockdown data; the difference track is displayed as the third track (KD - control for), and then again as the fourth track (KD - control for), but in this case with an adjustment to cut-off values below −0.01. A difference track with a −0.01 cut-off was also generated from the reverse reads (KD - control rev, bottom track). Arrows indicate regions of runaway transcription. All tracks in the figure, together with other related datasets, have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE50860). (b) UCSC Genome Browser tracks of a multi-gene region, including a gene encoding a ribosomal protein. The top two tracks display the original data for control and 7SK knockdown cells (Control for and 7SK KD for, respectively). The bottom row displays the difference track with a −0.01 cut-off. (c) Same display as for (b), but for the multi-gene region surrounding a different ribosomal protein gene. Only the difference track is shown.
                    , To demonstrate the effect of 7SK knockdown more clearly, we also include in Figure 1 tracks generated from Castelo-Branco et al. datasets following a bioinformatics processing pipeline that included normalization and a simple subtraction of the control dataset from the knockdown dataset (Figure 1a, third track)., In the difference track (Figure 1a, third track), the sum of the signals over the entire genome is equal to zero. Positive values indicate transcripts that were induced by 7SK knockdown. These positive values are mathematically compensated by negative values primarily over exons of pre-existing mRNAs. Negative changes in exon reads should not be thought of as actual decreases in mRNAs. In fact, it is likely that most mRNAs do not change significantly. Therefore, to enhance further the ability to see the 7SK knockdown-induced transcripts, the difference tracks elsewhere in Figure 1 are presented with a scale that cuts off most of the negative values (Figure 1a, fourth track; Figure 1b, third track; Figure 1c)., A representative 6 million bp region on chromosome 4, with a large number of genes, visually demonstrates the basic finding of the Castelo-Branco et al. study (Figure 1a). New transcripts, indicated by arrows, are found spanning several hundred thousand base pairs downstream of expressed genes. Castelo-Branco et al. conclude that 7SK is required for normal transcription termination downstream of polyadenylation sites., The difference tracks demonstrate that the new regions transcribed after knockdown of 7SK do not have discrete stop-points, but instead the density of transcripts tends to trail off after several hundred thousand base pairs. Strikingly, in many of these regions, the same pattern is mirrored by transcription in the opposite direction (Figure 1a, fifth track). We suggest that, perhaps, after knockdown of 7SK, Pol II enters a ‘runaway’ transcription mode and, like a runaway train, is doomed to have a head-on collision, derailing transcription in both directions. According to this hypothesis, we would expect long distances to be covered only when significant opposing transcription is not encountered., Although Castelo-Branco et al. suggested that 7SK possesses a direct role in repressing gene expression as well as transcription downstream of polyadenylation sites, an alternative explanation is that the increase of active P-TEFb caused by the knockdown could be responsible for the effects observed. In support of this idea, Castelo-Branco et al. noted that HEXIM1 expression was upregulated, and this occurs whenever cells are confronted with extra P-TEFb [1]. In this way, P-TEFb would be ‘driving that train’, as described in the Grateful Dead song commemorating a famous train wreck in 1900 caused by an out-of-control engineer, Casey Jones. Castelo-Branco et al. also found ‘trouble ahead, trouble behind’, in that knockdown of 7SK led to an increase in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) derived from antisense transcription upstream of some active genes. Such lncRNAs are frequently coordinately regulated with their sense partners [5], and their transcription has been shown to require P-TEFb [6]., Normally, RNA processing is coupled to transcription, with introns being removed as the gene is being transcribed and 3'-end processing being coupled to termination [7, 8]. One of the most striking results extracted from Castelo-Branco et al. data is that, after 7SK knockdown, Pol II appears to ignore polyadenylation signals and does not terminate downstream of active genes. For example, transcription downstream of two ribosomal protein genes is increased after 7SK knockdown, and the runaway transcription proceeds through downstream genes, again ignoring their polyadenylation signals (Figure 1b,c)., It appears that, after 7SK knockdown, splicing is also disallowed as the accumulated RNAs in the downstream genes are uniform throughout both introns and exons (Figure 1b,c). In a related study, disruption of the 7SK snRNP in zebrafish has been demonstrated to affect alternative splicing [9]., The results described by Castelo-Branco et al., together with our analysis of their data, suggest that knockdown of 7SK causes runaway transcription that is disconnected from RNA processing. This surprising finding provides a window through which the mechanisms of coupling RNA processing to transcription and the consequences of uncoupling might be viewed. The runaway transcription uncovered by Castelo-Branco et al. could also be the explanation for pervasive transcription in which large parts of mammalian genomes are transcribed [10]., Currently, it is unclear how knockdown of 7SK and the resulting increased levels of P-TEFb caused the observed phenotype, but there are several possibilities. If the normal mechanisms regulating recruitment of P-TEFb were bypassed by global release of the factor from the 7SK snRNP, as a result of the knockdown, the resulting elongation complexes or the transcripts themselves might not be appropriately modified. It will be interesting to determine whether the runaway elongation complexes acquire carboxy-terminal domain phosphorylation at Ser2, which is associated with productive elongation. A second intriguing possibility is that 5' capping of the transcript might not be complete. If transcripts were uncapped, they would likely be unstable. However, if they were capped, but not methylated on the 7 position (m7G), they would be stable, but unable to be processed efficiently., If P-TEFb is the engineer ‘driving that train’, then the 7SK snRNP should be considered to be the conductor whose responsibility it is to ensure that the train leaves the station at the right time. This new study suggests that uncontrolled P-TEFb might lead to runaway transcription and that the warning from the 7SK snRNP is: ‘Casey Jones, you’d better watch your speed!’"

We discuss how intelligent algorithms might provide support, leading to faster throughput., The systematic description of variation has gained increasing importance since the discovery of the causal relationship between a genotype placed in a certain environment and a phenotype [1]. The triumvirate connection of a phenotype, the underlying genotype and the environment in which the genotype is placed plays an important role to enhance our knowledge. Phenotypes can be applied to clinical questions, for example, the genetic origins of diseases [2–4], as well as biological problems, such as the evolution of species over time [5]. For example, PhenomeNET [6] compares phenotypes recorded in mutagenesis experiments in eight different species with the signs and symptoms of human diseases and uses orthology to determine viable gene candidates. Another example for the application of phenotypes is the PhenoScape knowledge base [7], which records phenotypes to answer questions such as ‘How were limbs formed from fins?’ Effective use of phenotype information and an eventual facilitation of translational research [8] requires researchers to achieve a common mindset and build a shared conceptual view on the definition, representation and interoperability of phenotypes. While this need has been previously recognized, it has, however, proven to be a challenging process, even for biological data corresponding to one species [9]. The intrinsic complexity of phenotypes is the most important obstacle in the process of reaching consensus and a common understanding. In general, phenotypes are considered to be observable characteristics, spanning from a molecular to an environmental level [8]., From a conceptual perspective, the comprehensive description of phenotypes covers three dimensions: (1) representation - defining phenotypes in a format that enables machine processing; (2) acquisition - capturing and storing phenotypes to enable large-scale analysis; and (3) processing - devising techniques with specific analytical goals. To these, we can add a fourth orthogonal dimension - interoperability (that is, aligning intraspecies and cross-species representations) - which emerges as a result of the intrinsic interdisciplinarity of the domain. Figure 1 depicts these dimensions together with existing solutions, discussed later in this review, and can be used as a map of the current phenotype technology ecosystem. Representation aims to structure and formalize the knowledge encoded in phenotypes by defining them in a particular context (for example, as part of a taxonomy) and by relating them to other domain-specific concepts (for example, anatomical models). Over the course of the years, ontologies have proven to be the most appropriate framework to unlock the potential contained in phenotype data, with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) [10] and the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) [11] pioneering the community efforts. Once specific representations have been defined, numerous projects embarked on the challenging acquisition goal. Examples include the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), aiming to catalogue the entire mouse phenome through systematic gene knockouts [12], or the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study [13], unraveling the origins of rarely occurring human genetic diseases by gathering copy number variations (CNVs) as well as point mutations and associated phenotypes from individual patients and their ancestors. Most of these projects follow a traditional manual curation approach. However, with advances in biomedical natural language processing, researchers have also started to look into automating the acquisition process [14, 15].

                        Overview of the four perspectives of phenotype information together with existing corresponding solutions. From a generic perspective, the phenome ecosystem can be described according to three main dimensions, in addition to a fourth orthogonal one: (i) representation - providing the mechanisms required to capture phenotype knowledge; (ii) acquisition - providing the tools for acquiring and storing phenotype data and knowledge; (iii) processing - dealing with the use and application of the phenotype knowledge in diverse contexts; and (iv) interoperability - aiming to bridge the different representations and formalisms describing phenotype knowledge. The figure depicts a map of the current solutions corresponding to each of the four dimensions. Two major strands emerge when targeting the representation and acquisition of phenotypes - that is, focusing on pre-composed or post-composed phenotypes. Also, some approaches deal with multiple dimensions at the same time.

                    , Finally, with the increasing amount of available phenotype data, initial steps have been taken to process and achieve interoperability of data from a range of resources using semantic layers [3, 4, 16, 17]. Interoperability through semantic layers means that ontologies are aligned to each other, for example, through lexical or ontological features, and the aligned ontologies enable the comparison of data being annotated with different ontologies. The integrated data can then be processed and facilitate biological discoveries. For example, PhenoDigm [18] aligns phenotypes from mutagenesis experiments in several species with the signs and symptoms of human diseases through ontological as well as lexical features. Once the phenotypes are aligned, the mutated genes are ranked according to their phenotype similarity with the disease, and the mutated genes exhibiting the highest similarity with the disease constitute candidate genes for this disease. However, interoperability and processing of data cover only a very small subset of all available data and further projects are required to address these aspects., In this review, we assess the current status of phenotype information technologies, with a focus on the perception of phenotypes in different domains and the influence of this perception on the above-mentioned four dimensions. We highlight the progress made towards extant goals as well as provide a visionary perspective on the next steps required to bridge the existing solutions to facilitate seamless cross-domain research., Given the variety of phenotype descriptions [34] and resources [19, 35, 36], and the diversity of domains phenotypes are relevant to, existing tools fulfill versatile purposes. In the area of medicine, phenotypes are applied to: (i) screening, predicting or prioritizing genes that are potentially relevant to human genetic disorders [3, 4, 16] (for example, PhenomeNET showed a potential connection between Tetralogy of Fallot (OMIM:187500) and the mouse gene Adam19 (MGI:3028702) that is supported by other published studies); (ii) analyzing patients with unidentified medical conditions [37] (the authors suggested 431 potential causes, all novel, for 27 CNV disorders); or (iii) finding new ways of treating diseases with existing drugs [17] (for example, PhenomeDrug [38] suggests that tretinoin could be used as therapy for cystic fibrosis (OMIM:219700); this is also reported in the scientific literature). However, all these tools rely on the public availability of phenotype data represented with semantic annotations and diverse semantic similarity metrics [39] to derive associations between phenotypes and genes, diseases or drugs., PhenomeNET [3] and MouseFinder [16] are two examples of tools that use animal models from Mouse Genome Database (MGD) [35] to identify potential novel gene candidates for heritable diseases contained in OMIM. Both MGD and OMIM use a different ontological phenotype representation [34]; however, interoperability is achieved via logical axioms built on EQ statements (see Unraveling phenotype structures). Figure 3 depicts an example of such cross-species interoperability using EQ statements. Unfortunately, these are available for only a subset of the contained phenotypes and are mostly manually generated [40] in order to ensure correctness. Another difference between the two approaches can be found in the way they process phenotypes. PhenomeNET aims to acquire the entire phenome for a mouse model or a disorder, while MouseFinder focuses on identifying meaningful pairs of phenotypes.

                        Example of cross-species phenotype interoperability using the entity/quality (EQ) formalism. This example depicts a mapping between two species-oriented concepts (HP:0001600 (Abnormality of the larynx) in human and MP:0002249 (Abnormal larynx morphology) in mouse) denoting the same conceptual phenotype. As opposed to classic mapping mechanisms, where a direct relation would be created between the two concepts, here the mapping is realized by transforming each phenotype in a post-composed format (that is, EQ statements), followed by the alignment of the corresponding elementary items. The quality is captured by a single common entity (PATO:000460 - Abnormal), while the anatomical terms are bridged via a term defined by an overarching anatomical ontology.

                    , Phenotypes have also been used to support clinical diagnosis. Phenomizer [41], for example, uses a semantic scoring mechanism that calculates the similarity of a phenotype with the signs and symptoms of a disease. This procedure is particularly helpful in cases of patients where a diagnosis is difficult due to controversial phenotype information, for example, patients contained in the Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype (DECIPHER) [36]. A similar approach has also been followed by Paul et al. [42] with a focus on skeletal dysplasias. Finally, the same mechanism has been applied to study to what extent existing disorder classifications (for example, Orphanet [43]) are grounded in the publicly available phenotype-disorder associations [44]. Koehler et al. [44] have shown that by combining OMIM and Orphanet phenotype data it is possible to re-create to a large extent human-made classifications, thus demonstrating the validity of the classifications as well as the value provided by existing disorder characterizations., Based on the assumption that species possess orthologous genes and that these genes exhibit identical phenotypes, the systematic assessment of phenotypes and their corresponding genes may reveal new functions when assessed across species. PhenomicDB [45] is a database not only holding textual phenotype descriptions for a number of species but also enabling the comparison of phenotypes across species through text mining, thus enabling the discovery of novel gene functions. PhenoGO [46] also applies text mining but instead of directly identifying gene-phenotype associations, it lists connections between phenotypes and GO annotations. As long as a gene is phenotypically described, a GO profile can be derived based on the assigned phenotypes., Most of the content in existing biological databases is populated through manual curation of the scientific literature; for example, MGD, OMIM or Zebrafish Information Network [47]. The process of manual curation is, however, time-consuming and labor intense, resulting in huge costs for creating and maintaining the databases. To reduce time, labor and costs, semi-automated solutions gain more and more importance in supporting biocuration. PharmGKB [48], for example, is a database holding information about entities relevant to pharmacogenetics that have been automatically extracted from published literature with text mining. Only parts of the PharmGKB data have been validated through curation efforts., PharmsPresso [49], another database generated from scientific literature, focuses on the extraction of relations between entities relevant to pharmacogenetics. When assessing phenotypes mentioned in OMIM records, van Driel and colleagues could derive meaningful phenotype clusters, resembling consistent GO annotations and protein-protein interactions [50]. Obtained phenotype information from this study was made available via the MimMiner web interface [51]. PhenoHM [52] allows, similar to PhenomicDB, comparison of phenotype information on a textual level across species and to access orthologous genes via their phenotypes., In conclusion, even though initial steps have been made in the direction of the integration of phenotype data and text mining phenotype information, no exhaustive solutions have been developed yet to address the arising challenges from the analysis of phenotype data in medical, biological and translational contexts. Challenges include the differences in understanding of what a phenotype constitutes in different domains [53] (for example, the synonymous use of disease, syndrome, trait and phenotype), gaps in the terminologies, vocabularies and ontologies to represent phenotypes (for example, HPO with its 10,000 concepts has a lot of information about skeletal phenotypes but is sparse in other areas), missing annotations in databases (for example, diseases in OMIM are under annotated [54]), and jargon for individual domains (for example, automatically generating clusters from phenotypes from different species leads to mostly a cluster for certain species instead of a mixed cluster that would result from a shared terminology [55]). Most likely, similar to the generic Web environment, there will never be a ‘one size fits all’ solution; however, clearly defining biological and medical solutions will help to identify potential domain-specific breakthroughs, as well as highlight where improvements are required in order to keep pace with all the ongoing phenotype efforts., Despite the fact that the existing text mining systems still need improvements, systems based on text mining from news articles are now being used to support analysts in detecting infectious disease outbreaks such as pandemic influenza [56]. In experimental biology, groups of researchers have come together to propose shared tasks such as the Natural Language Processing of Biology Text (BioNLP) [57] and BioCreative challenges [58] that support database curators and accelerate the flow of results from the literature back to the scientific community. BioCreative, for example, has led to developments in gene normalization, chemical and drug name recognition, as well as assigning evidence codes to gene function. In the clinical domain, initiatives such as the i2b2 challenge [59] are aimed at helping translate the findings from genomics research into the design of targeted therapies for heritable diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension and multiple sclerosis. One common factor linking all of these fields together is the heterogeneous conceptual class of phenotypes., Two necessary research objectives for intelligent tools are (a) recognizing in text the phrases that form phenotypes and (b) linking them to established pre-composed or post-composed concepts in ontologies. As an example, consider the pre-composed term ‘Abnormal Purkinje cell dendrite morphology’ from Figure 2. This might appear in various forms in free text such as ‘The mice have abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic tree resulting in abnormal morphology’ and ‘Abnormal morphology of dendrites in Purkinje cells’. Success is likely to require a fusion of technologies: prior domain knowledge, natural language processing algorithms and reasoning. We approach this section by briefly surveying the technical issues surrounding these goals and ask if there is a robust technical solution on the near horizon., Constructing full phenotype vocabularies manually is a daunting task. Despite the success of dedicated phenotype ontologies such as HPO, MP, FYPO and others, the situation regarding pre-composed terminological resources - those in which the term appears without a division into its constituents - is still far from ideal. Such resources have been designed with a focus on classical centralized model databases, such as OMIM or MGD, and specific user communities in mind. However, as Thorisson et al. [60] argue, the centralized database structure sometimes has difficulty in handling complex relationships. In the case of phenotypes, both the concepts and the disciplines that use them are heterogeneous. This makes standards of scope, granularity and compositionality difficult to establish. Moreover, the generation of one pre-composed ontology covering an entire domain (for example, all phenotypes within one particular species) would not be maintainable due to the sheer amount of existing phenotypes., In time, algorithmic techniques may be developed to fill the gap between pre-composed ontologies and free text variations. One approach to bridging (also called linking [61], normalization [62] and grounding [63]) from text to ontology is to develop automated mapping algorithms. Examples of such applications, currently used on a large scale by the biomedical community, are MetaMap [64], which bridges text and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [65], or the NCBO Annotator [66], which maps textual entries to entities defined by ontologies stored in the NCBO BioPortal. In general, these applications identify term candidates using shallow parsing, generate plausible alternative forms (synonyms) and then match them to the entities forming the knowledge base (for example, the UMLS). Many options and configurations exist, including the ability to include/exclude particular ontologies or semantic groups, or to detect the degree to which variant candidates differ from the original textual form. However, from a user perspective, it is not apparent what weighting to attach to different forms of evidence. Furthermore, one of the major shortfalls of these algorithms is that they match only single constituent phrases, missing coverage in more complex grammatical structures such as striking upslanting of the palpebral fissures, small nose with broad root or short neck with loose skin noted by Schofield et al. [53] in (OMIM:211750). They may also fail in finding associations between closely related but superficially different surface forms such as high blood pressure and hypertension. Finally, a related challenge is in identifying semantic equivalence across ontologies: for example, in cross-species analysis where equivalent phenotypes need to be identified in model organisms; for example, enlarged hind paws in mouse and enlarged feet in human [16]. Specific, phenotype and/or domain-oriented approaches have also been proposed based on data-driven learning, that is, machine learning, from labeled collections of texts and dictionaries (for example, [14, 15, 67]). In these examples, a software program learns from a small manually annotated data set whether a text span represents a phenotype or not, and can, after learning, be applied to more text to identify phenotype mentions. However, these represent mere pioneering efforts and require additional work in order to become reliable., Another requirement of intelligent tools is the support of extensions and generation of mappings between ontological resources. As discussed earlier, phenotypes can be considered broadly as being compositional entities. For example, HP:0000365 - High frequency hearing loss consists of an anatomical process, GO:0007605 - Sensory perception of sound, and a quality, PATO:0002018 - Decreased magnitude, indicating an abnormality of the entity. Given the diverse nature of phenotypes, several researchers have suggested providing post-composed terms [27] in which the constituent parts are provided in a federated fashion by reference to external vocabulary systems. So far, production of post-composed terms has been mainly carried out by manual curation [28, 68]. Lately, however, several automated approaches have been proposed, each of which relies on natural language processing techniques to convert terms from the pre-composed to the post-composed form [26, 29, 69]., Current studies for free-text phenotype recognition and normalization appear hampered by a lack of gold standard data used for training and evaluation and there is a danger that inferences about the best methods may be impaired. Developing accurate systems depends crucially on both an open communication across domains, so that a common understanding about phenotypes and the research needs surrounding them can be achieved, as well as on the development of annotation standards. Furthermore, high-quality large-scale data sets are needed for both trainable systems and benchmark evaluation. The process of collecting and publishing such datasets is time-consuming and costly. However, several projects, such as the IMPC, aim to deal with this challenge yet require time until they reach a certain level of maturity. The lack of open data is also apparent in the clinical domain where the desire to develop new patient treatments has to be balanced against ethical concerns about patient privacy. Steady progress is being made alongside the development of de-identification algorithms [70], as well as collaborative initiatives, such as i2b2, which bring together patient data providers and technologists., Even though initial work has been done in phenotype representation, acquisition and application, further steps are required in order to unlock the full potential of phenotype information, which in turn will drive the knowledge discovery process. Phenotype representations have to be harmonized across different species and a balance has to be found between terminologies used in communities and benefits across research domains. The complexity of phenotype information still hinders the development of a consistent formalization and prevents seamless integration of and data mining across diverse resources. The ongoing Linked Open Data efforts (for example, Bio2RDF [71]) provides access to increasing amounts of phenotype data that require a unified representation, which would then facilitate the creation of a broader picture surrounding hypotheses derivation from the data., On a different note, promising first steps have been achieved in the domain of cross-species hypotheses generation. However, the benefits are impacted by both representation and acquisition. With the ever-growing amount of data, manual assessments are at this point infeasible and automated methods to analyze the data are urgently required. Due to a lack of a uniform representation of phenotypes across different domains, integration and consequently knowledge propagation are interrupted. The best benefits can be achieved with a complete and consistent coverage of the up-to-date knowledge about phenotypes and their influencing factors that enable hypotheses generation and derivation of novel findings. From a different perspective, the acquisition of phenotype data could also be tremendously improved through solving mismatched expectations. While a small subset of specific and a large set of generalized solutions exist, cross-community and cross-domain efforts are required to enable a better fit of generalized solutions to existing problems, and specific solutions to be repurposed to other problems. A clear and common understanding about existing problems and possible solutions is required that can only be achieved through open communication. Open communication will allow us to advance research in the field and to derive future solutions that target well-specified, real issues., Furthermore, automated and supported acquisition of data is only possible with reliable methods. In recent years significant and welcome progress has been made in systematic evaluation of data-driven techniques through shared tasks like BioCreative and BioNLP. On the other hand, text mining progress has sometimes been behind the expectation of user communities due to inaccuracies in system output. This is largely because the language being processed is inherently ambiguous and requires new techniques and resources; for example, cross-domain event extraction, grounding, term decomposition, and harmonized understanding at a document-wide level. Phenotype concept recognition in text is a key non-trivial task that now needs to be addressed. Complex event extraction and normalization involving phenotypes are foundation tasks that need attention from the technical community to deliver working solutions into the hands of users., Common representation formats for mark-up in text is also important, in particular for phenotype data, and the efforts made over the years by BioCreative and BioNLP should be closely followed. This should be aided by closer dialogue between the text mining, curator and biology communities. Developments in community dialogue on gold standards and system critiques could follow the encouraging model of the User Advisor Group in BioCreative 2011, leading to new approaches for enhancing the user experience., In conclusion, we believe that improved communication would enable a common understanding across the different research domains and speed-up the development of solutions for most of the existing technical issues. Additional workshops are needed to allow researchers to gather and exchange phenotype resources, including their interpretation, representation, mining and integration. Once a shared mindset has been achieved, all four steps mentioned in this paper will reach a streamlining phase and will hence support translational research attain its real potential."

In mammals, each neurexin gene encodes an α-neurexin in which the extracellular portion is long, and a β-neurexin in which the extracellular portion is short. As a result of alternative splicing, both major isoforms can be transcribed in many variants, contributing to distinct structural domains and variability. Neurexins act predominantly at the presynaptic terminal in neurons and play essential roles in neurotransmission and differentiation of synapses. Some of these functions require the formation of trans-synaptic complexes with postsynaptic proteins such as neuroligins, LRRTM proteins or cerebellin. In addition, rare mutations and copy-number variations of human neurexin genes have been linked to autism and schizophrenia, indicating that impairments of synaptic function sustained by neurexins and their binding partners may be relevant to the pathomechanism of these debilitating diseases., Neurexins are transmembrane proteins that function primarily at the cell surface of neurons [1–3]. Neurexin variants are essential for Ca2+-dependent transmission at diverse types of excitatory and inhibitory synapses from the central and peripheral nervous system [4–8], and play additional roles in their formation and differentiation [9–14]. One of the most intensely studied features of neurexins is their ability to bind extracellularly to proteins of other synaptically connected neurons. The first and prototypical interaction partner discovered was postsynaptic neuroligin [15, 16]. However, a number of additional molecules associated with the synaptic cleft have been identified as binding partners, including neurexophilin [17–19], dystroglycan [20], LRRTM proteins [21, 22] and cerebellin [23, 24]. Neurexin isoforms bound to neuroligins, for example, can form trans-synaptic complexes at excitatory and inhibitory synapses that are involved in synapse specification, establishment, maturation and plasticity. Important from a medical point of view, impairments caused by mutations in the neurexin-neuroligin complex [25] lead to an imbalance of excitatory to inhibitory activity in neuronal circuits, which has been implicated in the pathomechanisms of autism spectrum disorders [26] and schizophrenia [27]., There are three neurexin genes in the mammalian genome [2, 3, 28]. In addition, a member of the Caspr/paranodin/CTNAP family is named ‘neurexin 4’ for historical reasons but in fact contains a domain structure that is only more distantly related [29, 30], and is thus not included in our discussion here. Each neurexin gene encodes two major protein isoforms: the extracellularly long α-neurexin and a short β-neurexin (Figure 1). They are transcribed from independent promoters [1] but share most sequences (Figure 1). β-Neurexins differ by using specific first exons (exon 17 or 18, depending on the nrxn gene; Figure 2a) to encode an atypically long signal peptide and some unique amino-terminal residues, while the carboxy-terminal part is identical to α-neurexins [2]. The genes for neurexin 1 (nrxn1) and 3 (nrxn3) are among the largest in the mammalian genome (Table 1), stretching more than 1 Mbp in mice and humans [30, 31]. They cover nearly 0.1% of the entire human genome [31], and human nrxn3 extends over about 2% of chromosome 14 [30]. It has been suggested that the size of mammalian nrxn genes limits their expression to postmitotic cells such as neurons, or slowly dividing cells such as β-islet cells, because their transcription in rapidly dividing cells would take too long to be completed [31]. A single α-neurexin locus is also present in invertebrates, as has been shown for Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera and Caenorhabditis elegans[30, 32], but the shorter β-isoform has only been confirmed for C. elegans[33]. Consistent with a rapid mitotic cycle, invertebrate neurexins are transcribed from shorter genes with smaller introns and without extensive alternative splicing (Figure 2b).

                        Domain organization of α-neurexins and β-neurexins. Neurexins are type I transmembrane proteins with a single path transmembrane helix (TM) that separates amino-terminal extracellular from cytosolic intracellular domains. The hallmark of neurexins is a cassette of LNS(green)-EGF(orange)-LNS(green) that is repeated three times in α-neurexin (Nrxn1α), albeit with low sequence conservation (16% identity and 27% homology). β-Neurexin (Nrxn1β) starts with its own exon that encodes a signal peptide (SP) and unique 37 histidine-rich residues (blue). The remainder is identical to the corresponding α-neurexin starting from the last LNS domain. Red symbols indicate positions of up to five canonically conserved splice sites (SS#1 to SS#5), and hexamers point to N-glycosylation sites and O-glycosylation sites. EGF, epidermal growth factor-like domain; LNS, laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin.

                        Genomic organization of neurexin genes. (a) Gene organization of mouse neurexins (nrxn) with exons (vertical lines) segregating introns (horizontal lines). The nrxn2 gene is 10 times smaller than nrxn1 or nrxn3 due to shorter introns but the relative positions of transcription starts for α-variants and β-variants (kinked arrows) are similar in all cases. Red numbers indicate alternatively spliced exons, while β-specific exons are in black. The first splice site (SS#1) accepts different inserts derived from combinations of two to four mini exons, whereas others such as SS#2 can also use parts of an insert sequence from one exon. (b) Vertebrate nrxn genes are up to 100 times longer than the single nrxn from invertebrates. The length ratio of Drosophila (dm nrxn) to mouse neurexins (ms nrxn) 2 and 3 is 1:10:100, respectively.
                    , In addition to the two major α-neurexin and β-neurexin variants, vertebrate neurexin genes contain five conserved alternative splice sites in the α-neurexin coding sequence (SS#1 to SS#5) and two in β-neurexin (SS#4 and SS#5) that by permutation allow for about 3,908 possible neurexin variants. For example, the SS#1 of neurexin 1 consists of four mini-exons (2, 3, 4 and 5; Figure 2a) that can be inserted in 24 permutations [30]. In addition, some of the splice events may lead to soluble isoforms lacking the membrane-bound carboxy-terminal part of the protein [28]. Alternative splicing is a hallmark of all neurexin genes [1, 30–32, 34, 35], and has received considerable attention because binding to postsynaptic partners was found to depend on splicing events, at least partially. Some alternatively spliced exons in neurexins are more conserved than exons that are constitutively expressed [30], supporting the idea that long introns with weak splice sites and rare splice events result in higher conservation of the entire inserted DNA, often indicating functionally important protein sequences [36]. In particular, the inserted protein sequences at SS#2 and SS#4 are highly conserved and all known α-neurexin interacting proteins bind to the domains where SS#2 and SS#4 are located (see below)., A phylogenetic tree of the protein family demonstrates that neurexin 1, neurexin 2 and neurexin 3 of the same genome differ more than the same isoform between species (Figure 3). Because of that and since neurexin 1 and 3 are more closely related than either is to neurexin 2, a gene duplication has likely taken place before vertebrates evolved, and each of the three paralogous isoforms has continued to change independently. Other paralogous genes in the vicinity of the genome localization of neurexins in fact indicate an ancient large-scale segmental duplication, but a functional inter-relationship of the genes involved is not obvious [31]. Although nrxn genes differ mostly within a genome, no functional differentiation of neurexin 1, 2 and 3 has been determined so far, consistent with the observation that α-neurexins are able to replace each other in a rescue experiment [37].

The tree was generated using neurexin amino acid sequences from several vertebrate species and invertebrate homologs, and a gap-free sequence alignment with GeneBee [132]. The neurexin 1 (Nrxn1) family is shown in red, neurexin 2 (Nrxn2) in blue, and neurexin 3 (Nrxn3) in green. The invertebrate sequences are shown in black. Species names and GenBank accession numbers [133] are given for each branch. Cluster distance values indicated at branches represent the amino acid differences for the particular group of sequences. Note that the more distantly related Caspr/paranodin/CTNAP family member ‘neurexin 4’ contains a different domain structure and is not included in the analysis.
                    , α-Neurexins contain six LNS (laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin) domains with three epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains interspersed (Figure 1, upper panel). The shorter β-neurexins are identical to the carboxyl terminus of α-neurexins starting from αLNS6 but have a unique amino-terminal stretch of 37 histidine-rich residues (Figure 1, lower panel). All neurexins are N-glycosylated and the sequence between αLNS6 and the transmembrane region is characterized by O-glycosylation [2]. The cytosolic domains have a potential endoplasmatic retention signal, a cytoskeleton integrating protein 4.1, and a PDZ-binding motif that is required for trafficking of neurexins [38]., LNS domains in neurexins are characterized by a β-sheet sandwich built by strands β3, β8, β9 and β10, β4, β5, β6 and β7, and an adjacent two-stranded sheet of β2 and β11 (Figure 4). This core fold contains more than 50% of the domain and is structurally similar to the concanavalin A (ConA) fold family [39], although the primary protein sequences vary considerably [40–43]. Due to the family classification, LNS domains are thought to behave like glycan-binding lectins. For example, dystroglycan requires a specific glycosylation to bind to laminin LNS4-5 [44, 45], but a general function of LNS domains as lectins has not been demonstrated so far. All ConA family members bind divalent cations like Ca2+ or Zn2+, and the LNS domains of neurexin, laminin and agrin have similar Ca2+ sites at the rim of the LNS domain (Figure 4). Unlike other Ca2+-binding proteins, this Ca2+ coordination site is rigid and undergoes no conformational change upon calcium binding. Neurexin αLNS2 and αLNS6/βLNS are further distinguished by the presence of hydrophobic residues, and Ca2+ binding to this last LNS domain neutralizes the negatively charged pocket, allowing neuroligin to make mainly hydrophobic contacts with neurexin [46, 47]. Currently, binding partners are known for only αLNS2 and αLNS6/βLNS (Table 2). Interestingly, neuroligin and LRRTM, albeit having non-homologous structures, compete for the same Ca2+-binding epitope on αLNS6 [40–42, 48], while dystroglycan binds Ca2+-dependently to αLNS2 and αLNS6, which have no similar surfaces [46]. Ca2+-dependent binding apparently tolerates shape and sequence variations, while Ca2+-independent binding of neurexophilin and cerebellin requires exclusive features on αLNS2 [17] and αLNS6 + SS#4 [23, 24], respectively.

The diagram shows a ribbon structure of αLNS6 (PDB ID: 2R1D) representing the lowest common denominator of the six neurexin LNS folds; it is used here to highlight specific features among the individual domains. The fold is formed by 14 β-strands (β1 to 14), which are generally tightly connected. In αLNS6/βLNS, β10 (blue) can be displaced by an alternatively spliced insert at SS#4 (red). The synopsis also shows that positions of splice sites SS#2 (green) from αLNS2, SS#3 (orange) from αLNS4, and SS#4 from αLNS6 are all in vicinity of the corresponding Ca2+-binding site. The splice insert in SS#4 participates in Ca2+ coordination, while an insert in the SS#3 domain might prevent Ca2+ association in adjacent αLNS3. In the αLNS3 domain, the β4/β5 loop (magenta) is prolonged and can be interpreted as a permanent splice insert that interacts with the insert in SS#3. These β-loop variations individually shape each LNS domain around the Ca2+-binding site suitable to mediate specific LNS-protein or LNS-glycan interactions. LNS, laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin.
                    , The binding of some of these proteins to αLNS2 or αLNS6 can be modified by alternative splicing that occurs in a hypervariable region in the vicinity of the Ca2+-binding site (Figure 4). While neurexophilin binds αLNS2 independently of alternative splicing [17], dystroglycan and LRRTM require a splice insert-free LNS domain [20, 48] and cerebellin binds presumably directly to the insert in SS#4 of αLNS6/βLNS [23, 24]. Splice insert dependency of neurexin/neuroligin complex formation is more complicated because neuroligins also have two splice sites, termed A and B. While all neurexins share the five splice sites, the neuroligins differ: neuroligin 1 contains splice sites A and B [16], neuroligin 2 and neuroligin 3 have only splice site A [49] and neuroligin 4 is not alternatively spliced [50]. Co-crystal data exist for the binding interface of neurexin 1αLNS6/βLNS without insert in SS#4 to neuroligin 1 and 4 [40–42], and neuroligin 3 is predicted to form similar complexes [40–42]. In contrast, the proposed binding interface of neuroligin 2 to αLNS6 differs structurally with a G500Q change from neuroligin 1 to 2, which raises the possibility that neuroligin 2 uses an alternative binding epitope [42, 51]., Affinity purification of neuroligin with the extracellular domain of β-neurexin originally suggested that only β-neurexin without an insert in SS#4 (−SS#4) binds neuroligin 1 [16]. This apparent splice insert dependency of neurexin binding to neuroligin then led to the generalized idea of a splice code that classifies specific pairings in the neurexin/neuroligin complex (for neurexins: ±SS#4; for neuroligins: ±A, ±B) according to specific roles at excitatory and inhibitory synapses [13, 15, 16, 52, 53]. Subsequently, it has been shown that also α-neurexins, even with insert in SS#4, bind to neuroligin 1(−B) [15] and neuroligins 2 and 3, albeit with lower affinity than β-neurexins [54, 55]. Biochemical experiments have now established that, with one exception discussed below, any neurexin can bind any neuroligin [54, 56] and that neurexins + SS#4 yield considerable amounts of protein complexes with neuroligins if only the incubation time is long enough [46]. This behavior can be explained by recent crystal structures of β-neurexin + SS#4 that show a remarkable displacement of the inserts at SS#4 [54, 57]., Surface plasmon resonance binding and crystal structures of the β-neurexin/neuroligin complex [40–42, 54] now suggest a dynamic rather than a static splice code, in which β-neurexin + SS#4 assumes an equilibrium between a neuroligin-inactive (non-binding; PDB ID: 2R1B) and an active form (PDB ID: 3 MW2) (Figure 5). In short-term binding studies the amount of active form may be too low for sufficient complex formation, while in overnight incubations all neurexins are transferred into the active form that binds to neuroligin [46, 53]. While all β-neurexins and all α-neurexins-SS#4 bind to all neuroligin variants [15, 46, 54–56, 58, 59], the splice code still restricts α-neurexin + SS#4 binding to neuroligin 1 + B [15], forming the exception mentioned above. Recent crystal structures of α-neurexin extracellular sequences containing the αLNS2-to-αLNS6 [55, 60] and αLNS5-to-LNS6 domains [59] eventually provided an explanation for this restriction by suggesting that the molecular switch of the insert in SS#4, necessary especially for binding of β-neurexin + SS#4 variants to neuroligin 1 + B [54], is sterically inhibited by the spatial orientation of αLNS5 and αEGF3. The fact that α-neurexins + SS#4 still bind to neuroligins without insert B suggests the presence of distorted intermediate conformations of αLNS6 + SS#4 similar to those in βLNS + SS#4/neuroligin 1 + A determined by NMR [61].
                    Figure 5
                      
                        Splice insert in SS#4 causes a molecular switch. Splice insert-free βLNS-SS#4 (PDB ID: 3B3Q; left panel) can bind efficiently to neuroligin (Nlgn) and leucine-rich repeat proteins (LRRTM), which have overlapping binding epitopes. The prolonged conformation caused by an insert in SS#4 (orange/red; from PDB ID: 2R1B) blocks binding to Nlgn and LRRTM, and instead allows the binding of cerebellin (Cbln, middle panel). This structure of βLNS + SS#4 is in equilibrium with an additional conformation (PDB ID: 3 MW2), in which β10 (cyan) is replaced by part of the SS#4 insert (orange, right panel). In the latter, Nlgn and LRRTM binding is restored, while interaction with Cbln should be abolished. The diagrams were made using the actual structural coordinates and PyMOL software (Schrödinger, Mannheim, Germany).
                    , The crystal structures of α-neurexin extracellular domains and electron microscopy studies also highlight important additional features of these molecules (Figure 6). (i) The core structure of αLNS2-to-αLNS5 is relatively rigid and does not change in the presence of Ca2+ or with an insert in SS#3 [55, 60]. Similarly, the splice insert at SS#2 is expected to prolong loop β8/β9 and should also not impact the remaining structure. In contrast, inserts at SS#1 and SS#5 are located in structurally distorted regions. While this permits inserts at SS#1 to increase the distance between αLNS1 and αLNS2 as observed [62], the putative role of a few inserted residues at SS#5 remains unclear at present. (ii) A conformational hinge between αLNS5 and αEGF3 allows a rotation of about 180°, which orients the αLNS2-to-αLNS5 core from a U-form to an elongated, active form parallel to presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes that allows binding to neuroligin [63]. (iii) The smaller β-neurexin assembles in a dense layer in a tetrameric 2:2 complex with neuroligin, while α-neurexin is highly variable in shape due to the hinges and the extended extracellular domain, which requires larger distances between complexes [64]. This scenario provides the first difference between the otherwise identical cytosolic carboxyl termini of α-neurexins and β-neurexins, as they could possibly be distinguished by their intermolecular distances. As a consequence, the spatial organization of proteins interacting with, for example, the identical PDZ-binding motif at the carboxyl terminus could be different for the two isoforms.

                        Structural models of α-neurexin. The diagram visualizes conformations that the extracellular domain of α-neurexin can assume. In the U-form (modeled from PDB ID: 3R05; left) only cerebellin (Cbln), neurexophilin (Nxph) and dystroglycan (DAG) might bind to LNS6 and LNS2, respectively. After rotation of about 180° in the αLNS5-αLNS6 hinge (modeled using PDB ID: 3ASI and 3R05; right), the core structure and αLNS6 become elongated and accessible to additional ligands, including neuroligins (Nlgn) and leucine-rich repeat molecules (LRRTM). The parentheses indicate the required presence (+) or absence (−) of the splice inserts in αLNS6 (SS#4) or αLNS2 (SS#2). Coordinates for αLNS1 have been modeled by sequence homology to other LNS domains because its electron density map was not resolved in the crystal structure [60]. Intracellularly, cytosolic proteins such as synaptotagmin (Syt), protein 4.1 from brain (4.1 m), CASK, Mint and Veli bind to the disordered carboxy-terminal domain of neurexins. LNS domains, green (numbered 1 to 6); EGF-like domains, yellow; splice inserts at splice sites #1 to #5, red. EGF, epidermal growth factor-like; LNS, laminin-neurexin-sex hormone binding globulin.
                    , Finally, the conservation of the splice insert sequence in SS#4 is in accordance with the conformational switch [54] that (i) increases affinity for Ca2+ binding by positioning an additional Ca2+ coordinating residue [57], and (ii) requires a match to the sequence of β10 that is replaced by the SS#4 insert. However, the reason for the conservation may be different: since the insert sequence at SS#4 itself binds exclusively to cerebellin [23, 24] and cerebellin constitutes an ancestral protein, it can be hypothesized that the interaction of neurexins + SS#4 with cerebellin may be responsible for the evolutionary pressure on the splice insert conservation, rather than the interaction of neurexin with neuroligins that is reduced by the alternative splicing at SS#4., The discovery of neurexins as a receptor for α-latrotoxin [3], a neurotoxin that causes massive neurotransmitter vesicle release from terminals, has argued in favor of a presynaptic localization. This location has been confirmed by the finding of a prominent presynaptic release phenotype in α-neurexin knockout (KO) mice [6, 65]. Nevertheless, additional postsynaptic defects and localization of transgenically expressed variants may indicate that a small population of postsynaptic neurexins exists [5, 66]. Due to the lack of isoform-specific antibodies for high-resolution morphology, endogenous neurexin proteins have not been mapped systematically to subpopulations of neurons and/or synapses by immunolabeling. Localization patterns have been obtained mostly from mRNA studies [1, 67–69] and by subcellular fractionation [65, 69]. In situ hybridization data reveal that neurexins 1/2 and neurexin 3 may be expressed initially in distinct cell populations [67], whereas in the mature central nervous system the α-neurexin and β-neurexin isoforms are distributed in a partially overlapping, partially differential pattern [1, 67]. In particular, the three β-isoforms show a more unique distribution, in which, for example, neurexin 1β is restricted to cortical layers 2 and 3, thalamus and parts of the hippocampus [1, 67]. Using the regulation by alternative splicing, juvenile neurons in chicken express insert-negative neurexin variants [68]. With progressing neuronal and synaptic development, the number of insert-positive variants increases [68]. Since insert-negative neurexins have the highest potential to bind to known interaction partners (Table 2), these data suggest that maturation is accompanied by reduced binding capacities for neuroligins, LRRTM and dystroglycan. Instead, insert-positive variants at SS#4 favor the binding to cerebellin [24, 70]. Interestingly, in the cerebellum where the cerebellin/GluRδ2 complex is abundantly expressed [24], much higher levels of neurexins lacking all inserts have been found compared with the rest of the brain [1]. These results are consistent with an activity-controlled expression of neurexin + SS#4 and, thereby, a regulated interaction with cerebellin/GluRδ2. Supporting this idea of an activity-dependent ‘splice-code’ that changes the profile of neurexins for binding partners, the generation of different splice variants was shown to be coupled to synaptic activity via the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase pathway and involves RNA-binding protein SAM68 [71, 72]. For example, it has been shown that the inclusion of a splice insert at SS#3 in neurexin 2 depends on depolarization and Ca2+ influx [73]. Furthermore, the expression of + SS#3/+SS#4-containing variants follows closely the activity rhythm in autonomous oscillating cells of the suprachiasmatic nucleus [71], and + SS#4 expression is reduced in α-neurexin isoforms after applying a learning and memory paradigm [74]. Unfortunately, expression results from different species and different experimental paradigms are sometimes contradictory [68, 75], suggesting that more research is needed to establish the regulated variability of splice variants and to determine which variants are actually realized under which conditions., KO studies in mice established the importance of α-neurexins as essential because they are required for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis at neuronal synapses [4–7, 11, 37]. For β-neurexins, in contrast, no results from KO studies have been published yet., The deletion of two or three α-neurexin isoforms resulted in severely impaired spontaneous and evoked neurotransmitter release at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in brainstem and neocortex [5, 6]. Even the deletion of a single isoform, neurexin 1α, resulted in a reduction of spontaneous release from excitatory synapses in hippocampal pyramidal neurons [4], emphasizing the importance of every neurexin for synaptic homeostasis [52]. In addition, the loss of one or more α-neurexin isoforms reduced Ca2+ currents and caused unresponsiveness to specific blockers [6], suggesting that an impaired Ca2+-channel function is part of the process. It remains unclear, however, how the deletion of α-neurexins uncouples N-type and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels from the neurotransmitter release machinery [37, 76]. A direct interaction of the extracellular domains of α-neurexins and the pore-forming subunits of the Ca2+ channels appears unlikely as neurexins are not required for normal Ca2+ currents per se[76], and the surface expression and number of Ca2+ channels were also unchanged in KO neurons [6]., Any mechanistic explanation of the effect of α-neurexins on Ca2+ channels also needs to consider the observation that the carboxyl terminus binds to PDZ-domain proteins such as CASK [77] and Mints [78]. Both, CASK and Mints interact with the β-subunit of N-type Ca2+ channels, while Mints also interact with P/Q-type Ca2+ channels [79]. This complex, in turn, could be coupled to synaptic vesicles by the interaction of α-neurexin with synaptotagmin [80] and/or Mints to Munc18 [78]. Although this molecular pathway provides a possible link between neurexins, Ca2+ channels and the release machinery, the comparatively moderate effect of genetic deletion of CASK and Mint on synaptic transmission [81, 82] does not support a crucial contribution of these molecules. More work needs to be done to integrate α-neurexins into the current view of Ca2+-channel tethering or positioning by synaptotagmins, RIMs, liprins and CAST/ERC/ELKS, which also appears independent of Mint or CASK [83]. In addition, recent advances on the function of Ca2+-channel α2δ subunits as important modulators of synaptic transmission [84] suggest alternative routes to influence Ca2+-channel activity and mobility [85]. This includes the possibility, albeit speculative, of direct or indirect interference with extracellular domains of α-neurexins that could explain why β-neurexins do not rescue the α-neurexin KO phenotype [37]., Studies using co-cultures between primary neurons and non-neuronal cells transfected with neurexins or neuroligins have uncovered their ability to stimulate the de novo formation of functional synapses by clustering presynaptic or postsynaptic proteins [12, 14]. Surface expression of neurexins induces clusters of PSD95 and gephyrin at excitatory and inhibitory postsynapses of contacting dendrites [10, 13]. Expression of neuroligins, in turn, induces clustering of presynaptic marker proteins on contacting axons [10] and different neuroligin isoforms appear to trigger differentiation of excitatory versus inhibitory terminals [9, 53, 86]. Interestingly, this strong synaptogenic effect of overexpressed neurexins and neuroligins observed in these cell culture assays has not been matched by prominently reduced numbers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in loss-of-function mouse models [6, 11, 87, 88]. For example, the multiple KO of α-neurexins leads to a moderate reduction of symmetric, presumably inhibitory, synapses and leaves excitatory synapse density unscathed that at the same time displays a severely impaired neurotransmitter release [5, 6, 11]. For neuroligins that have served as the prototypical synaptogenic molecule in vitro[14], there are no visible effects on synapse numbers in multiple or single KO mice [87, 88]. Overexpression versus deletion strategies cannot be the sole reason for these differences because lentiviral-mediated expression of neurexins has failed to elevate synapse numbers [8] and transgenic overexpression of neurexin in mice does not increase mini frequencies above wild-type levels [37]. Since RNAi-mediated knock-down of neurexins, in turn, can lower the numbers of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in cultured neurons [86], it is clear that more research is needed to define the role of the neurexin/neuroligin complex in synapse formation., Synapse formation assays have also been used to decipher the putative splice code for preferred binding between neurexins and neuroligins, and to other partners. Most studies using neurexins have been performed with overexpressed β-neurexin variants that represent the best binding partner for all neuroligin isoforms regardless of alternative splice inserts in either protein [15, 46, 54, 89], as also discussed above (Structural features and the splice-code hypothesis). Accordingly, β-neurexin instantly reaches the maximal synaptogenetic effect [90], and optimizing binding to neuroligin by deglycosylation or removal of the B insert does not significantly increase clustering of synaptic proteins [89]. In contrast, only a few cell culture studies have been performed with α-neurexins [12, 75, 89]. These were limited to α-neurexin + SS#4 variants that bind reliably only to neuroligins without insert B [15] but do not reach the complex forming capacity of β-neurexin + SS#4 to neuroligin 1-B [89]. Since neuroligin 1-B was shown to cluster and bind α-neurexins, it is not surprising that most synaptogenic effects of overexpressed α-neurexins have been observed at inhibitory synapses [12, 75]. This is because inhibitory synapses contain mostly neuroligin 2 [12, 91], which has similar biochemical binding properties to neuroligin 1-B [54]. As α-neurexins look more diffusibly distributed on the axonal surface [92] but are clustered by neuroligin 2/neuroligin 1-B [89], it can be hypothesized that α-neurexins are the more potent variants for dynamic adaptations that may be particularly relevant for inhibitory synapses., The observation that neuroligin 1 is more abundant at excitatory and neuroligin 2 at inhibitory synapses has led to the hypothesis that β-neurexin/neuroligin 1 + B and α-neurexin/neuroligin 2 are molecular determinants of the excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic input, respectively (Figure 7). While the role of α-neurexins is not restricted to inhibitory synapses [5, 6] and β-neurexins may also affect inhibitory transmission [8], it appears that GABAergic transmission plays a particularly important role in the so-called excitatory/inhibitory balance (E/I balance) at synapses (for example, [52, 93, 94]). It has become widely accepted that impairments in neurexins and neuroligins caused by mutations may disturb the balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity that is thought to be critical for the pathomechanisms in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia [25, 26, 95].

                        Trans-synaptic neurexin-neuroligin complexes shape excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Presynaptic α-neurexins or β-neurexins (red) can interact with dimeric neuroligins (green) across the synaptic cleft to regulate important aspects of establishment, differentiation and maturation of synapses. Isoforms and splice variants of both molecules have been proposed to be differentially distributed at excitatory or inhibitory synapses to establish specificity. Note that presence of β-neurexins (β-Nrxn) at inhibitory terminals is unclear, while for neuroligins (Nlgn), Nlgn2 and Nlgn4 show quite specific localization and roles at inhibitory synapses. Intracellularly, the cytosolic domains of Nrxn and Nlgn are able to cluster components of the presynaptic release machinery and of postsynaptic signaling pathways and transmitter receptors (R). The clustering ability of Nrxn and Nlgn variants at excitatory or inhibitory synapses is mostly derived from cell culture assays.

                    , The outcome of the autism genome-wide association study projects surprisingly revealed only weak correlations for ASD to common genetic variants, but identified genes with rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or copy number variations that have a considerable impact [96]. Such rare mutations have been found in the α-neurexin coding region of nrxn1[97–99], nrxn3[100] and the signal peptide of β-neurexins [101]. An excess of mutations in these genes is found in patients with ASD [27, 102], schizophrenia [103, 104] and substance abuse and impulsive behavior [105]. Historically, the neuroligin 3 single mutation R451C has been the first SNP of a protein gene associated with ASD [106] but other molecules such as nrxn1, nrxn3, nlgn3, nlgn4, shank2, shank3 and genomic regions at 1q21.1 and 16p11.2 are now accepted as bona fide ASD risk loci [100]. Some of the single site mutations found in patients have been introduced in mouse models, such as neuroligin 3 R451C [93, 107] and neuroligin 4 R704C [108]. Interestingly, analysis of mutations in mice also demonstrates converging phenotypes of different risk loci [109]. As might be expected, the mouse models recapitulate some but not all aspects of the diseases: for example, repetitive grooming as stereotype behavior in neurexin 1α KO, but not the social disabilities [4]. When tested in cell culture or biochemical assays, most mutations cause a complete loss of expression or largely reduced trafficking of the defective protein to synapses [109–111]. These observations highlight the central role of neurexins and neuroligins at the synapse and have prompted new research into the protein interaction network across the synaptic cleft that may provide insights into higher cognitive functions at the molecular level., Invertebrate models have already proven excellent systems to study multiple mutations in neurexin and neuroligin genes that are impossible to obtain in mice [112] or to follow effects on synaptic cell adhesion by imaging in live animals [113]. Due to the sequence conservation of neurexin and neuroligin throughout the animal kingdom, identification of mutations and binding partners in one species facilitates the finding of orthologs, and allows the description of a canonical protein network. For example, binding to neuroligin is blocked in all species investigated by a synthetic aspartate to alanine mutation in the neurexin αLNS6 domain that corresponds to the essential Ca2+-binding residue D137 of β-neurexin [41, 46, 114]. In addition, mutations Y189H, L319SSM and L849Q, which inhibit neuroligin function in Drosophila[115], can be readily localized on the mammalian neuroligin crystal structure [41] and are likely to destabilize the fold of the extracellular (Y85, L235) or the transmembrane domain (L712). This could explain the reduced level of neuroligin reaching the postsynapse [115], similar to other ASD mutations in mammals [97–101]. Finally, the fact that a synthetic D356R mutation in Drosophila neuroligin 1 rescues the KO phenotype [115] suggests neurexin-independent functions of neuroligin, as the corresponding mutation D271R in rat neuroligin 1 was found to inhibit neurexin binding [46]., Unlike these structural similarities, any functional comparisons need to keep in mind that mostly presynaptic α-neurexins interact with postsynaptic neuroligin in vertebrates, as discussed above. In C. elegans, in contrast, neurexin and also neuroligin are expressed presynaptically and postsynaptically [33, 113] and retrograde trans-synaptic signaling from the postsynapse to the presynapse in the worm is modulated by an interaction in trans and cis simultaneously [116]. It is also important to realize that while C. elegans expresses a β-neurexin with a yet unresolved function [113], flies rely on a single α-neurexin alone [35, 117]. It is therefore not surprising that the functional phenotypes in vertebrate and invertebrate neurexin mutant animals share similarities but can also differ considerably (reviewed in detail in [118]). For example, analyses of Drosophila loss-of-function mutants of α-neurexins have described effects on synapse ultrastructure [35, 117] that are absent from the mouse KOs [6, 11], whereas both model systems suffer from impaired neurotransmission. These limitations notwithstanding, the recent finding of a triple complex of α-neurexin/syd-1/liprin-α at the active zone of neuromuscular junctions in flies [119], for another example, will encourage the search for a similar complex in mammals that might help to solve the question why and how α-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to release sites., In addition to synapses of the central nervous system, neurexin isoforms have been reported to act in smooth muscle cells [116, 120, 121], pancreatic β-islet cells [122–124], melanotrophs of the hypophysis [76] and endothelial cells [125]. For example, α-neurexins and neuroligins modulate Ca2+-triggered exocytosis from melanotrophs in the hypophysis [76] and from insulin-secreting β cells in the endocrine pancreas’s islets of Langerhans [124]. In β cells, the cytosolic domain of α-neurexins is essential for insulin granule docking through an indirect interaction with granuphilin, which lines vesicles to the cell surface membrane that are ready for fusion [122]. In this process, the number of release-ready vesicles is homeostatically regulated by neurexin or granuphilin, while the reduction of either protein increases glucose-sensitive fusion. Interestingly, granuphilin is selectively expressed in β cells and melanotrophs, which might explain why α-neurexins function in both cell types. Since the granuphilin homolog Rab3A plays a similar role in the docking of synaptic vesicles in neurons, canonical protein complexes consisting of α-neurexins-CASK-Mint1/2-Rab3a/Granuphilin-Munc18 have been suggested [122]., The neurexin/neuroligin pair most likely represents one of the best characterized protein complexes at the neuronal synapse. Its modulation due to alternative splicing and isoform pairings is remarkable and its roles in synaptic function and differentiation are essential. However, important issues remain to be addressed., First, it is incompletely understood if α-neurexins and β-neurexins have overlapping [126] or different functions at the synapse. Rescue experiments have suggested that their functions are non-redundant [37], but analysis of multiple β-neurexin KOs and comparative knock-down studies will be necessary to address this issue directly., Second, the apparent preference of α-neurexins for GABAergic synapses as observed in some assays [10, 12, 13, 75] needs to be reconciled with the KO mouse phenotype that is characterized by a dramatic release impairment that affects both excitatory and inhibitory synapses [4, 6]., Third, neurexins act at the synapse but only little is known about how they are transported to the presynaptic terminal during intracellular trafficking. It has been shown that neurexin targeting requires a PDZ-binding motif interaction in mouse neurons [38] and a Syd-1/RhoGAP100F-dependent delivery in Drosophila[119]. However, the characteristics of the vesicular pathways responsible and the dynamics of the transport are unclear., Fourth, most known interacting proteins of neurexins bind to the last LNS domain of α-neurexin/the single LNS domain of β-neurexin, and only neurexophilin and dystroglycan are known to bind to αLNS2 (Table 2). It needs to be studied if the additional domains in α-neurexin simply act as spacers or if they provide additional sites for binding partners that have yet to be discovered., Fifth, the early expression and the preference of juvenile neurons for neurexins without splice inserts [67, 68] suggest an additional role of some neurexin variants in developmental processes such as neurite growth [11, 127] that needs to be explored in more detail., Finally, human genetic work and mouse models have linked the neurexin/neuroligin complex to synapse-related neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia [25]. It will be one of the most challenging tasks ahead of us to unravel the underlying cellular mechanisms that explain, for example, why mutations in the same molecules lead to diverse symptoms, a prerequisite to develop more causative therapeutic strategies."

Only recently it has become clear that p53 regulates the expression of several long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). However, relatively little is known about the role that lincRNAs play in this pathway., Here we characterize a lincRNA named Pint (p53 induced noncoding transcript). We show that Pint is a ubiquitously expressed lincRNA that is finely regulated by p53. In mouse cells, Pint promotes cell proliferation and survival by regulating the expression of genes of the TGF-β, MAPK and p53 pathways. Pint is a nuclear lincRNA that directly interacts with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and is required for PRC2 targeting of specific genes for H3K27 tri-methylation and repression. Furthermore, Pint functional activity is highly dependent on PRC2 expression. We have also identified Pint human ortholog (PINT), which presents suggestive analogies with the murine lincRNA. PINT is similarly regulated by p53, and its expression significantly correlates with the same cellular pathways as the mouse ortholog, including the p53 pathway. Interestingly, PINT is downregulated in colon primary tumors, while its overexpression inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells, suggesting a possible role as tumor suppressor., Our results reveal a p53 autoregulatory negative mechanism where a lincRNA connects p53 activation with epigenetic silencing by PRC2. Additionally, we show analogies and differences between the murine and human orthologs, identifying a novel tumor suppressor candidate lincRNA.","lincRNA, non-coding RNA, p53, gene regulation, Polycomb repressive complex 2","How cells coordinate and integrate information to produce adequate gene-expression output is still an unsolved question with important implications for biology and health. Even the slightest perturbation of cellular networks can affect homeostasis and lead to cell transformation. Of these cellular networks, the p53 pathway is possibly the most relevant for preservation of cellular homeostasis. The transcription factor p53 is located at the core of a complex wiring of signaling pathways, and it has been proposed as the master regulator of cell fate. The importance of the tumor suppressing functions of p53 is shown by its high mutation frequency in cancers and by the highly tumorigenic phenotype of p53 null mice [1]., We and others have shown that long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are part of the p53 transcriptional network [2–4]. LincRNAs are intergenic transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack functional open reading frames (ORFs). Although thousands of lincRNAs exist, only a relatively small number have been studied in some depth, indicating that lincRNAs have roles in numerous physiological processes that involve gene regulation [5, 6]. Many of these lincRNAs have been shown to act as molecular scaffolds that hold and guide chromatin complexes [7–9]. In particular, several lincRNAs have been found to be associated with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in a number of biological contexts, modulating PRC2-specific targeting of genes [8, 10, 11]. PRC2 is composed of three core components: Suppressor of zeste 12 (Suz12), Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED), and the H3K27 histone methyl transferase Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2). PRC2 represses gene expression by catalyzing H3K27 tri-methylation and modulating chromatin structure [12], and is closely linked with the aberrant proliferation of cancer cells. For instance, the Suz12 subunit is overexpressed in colon and breast cancers [13], and Ezh2 is upregulated in a number of tumors, including Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer [14, 15]. Moreover, Ezh2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, and is an indication of the metastatic potential of a tumor [15, 16]. Similarly, alterations in expression of lincRNAs in cancer have been reported, implicating lincRNAs as possible attractive therapeutic targets [17, 18]., In a previous work. we used mouse cell lines combined with custom microarrays to monitor the differential expression of lincRNAs, and found that p53 specifically activated several lincRNAs. We characterized one of them, lincRNA-p21, which was found to function as a transcriptional repressor [3]. However, the contribution of lincRNAs to p53 biology and to cancer still remains largely unexplored., Here, we expand this knowledge by characterizing Pint. We show that Pint is a ubiquitously expressed mouse lincRNA that is a direct p53 transcriptional target. Pint acts as a positive regulator of cell proliferation and survival, affecting the expression of hundreds of genes, including a fraction of the p53 transcriptional network. PINT interacts with PRC2 and is required for PRC2 targeting of specific genes for H3K27 tri-methylation and repression. We also show that the PINT human ortholog is similarly regulated by p53. Interestingly, whereas in normal tissue, PINT shows a significant inverse correlation with the p53 pathway, it is downregulated in colorectal cancer, and its enforced expression inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells. To our knowledge, the results presented here represent the first experimentally supported connection between the p53 pathway and Polycomb epigenetic regulation mediated by a lincRNA. Moreover, the data suggest that PINT may serve as a novel tumor suppressor., Although thousands of lincRNAs have been identified in mammalian cells, understanding of lincRNA biology and role in disease remains relatively poor. A common feature of lincRNAs is their fine transcriptional regulation [35, 36], which may be key to their specific regulatory roles. The transcription factor p53 has been subjected to thorough scrutiny over the years because of its relevance in cellular homeostasis, but only recently have researchers realized that lincRNAs are an active part of the p53 transcriptional network. Among them is lincRNA-p21, which functions as a transcriptional gene repressor in mouse cells [3], and PANDA, which regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in human fibroblasts [4]. Additionally, the lncRNAs linc-RoR [37] and loc285194 [38] have been reported to be post-transcriptional regulators in this pathway. In this study, we have expanded this knowledge by identifying and characterizing Pint, a bona fide p53 transcriptional target that acts as negative modulator of the p53 response., We identified three isoforms of Pint, transcribed from an intergenic region in the mouse chromosome 6. These transcripts are likely to be alternatively spliced variants, as they all share the 5' sequences and are regulated by p53. Indeed, Pint transcription is closely controlled by p53, which specifically binds to three functional p53REs contained inside the Pint genomic locus. While one of the three p53REs is located at the promoter, the other two are several kilobases downstream, and could function as transcriptional enhancers, contributing to the fine regulation of Pint levels upon p53 activation., 
                Pint levels are finely controlled by p53, but unlike many other known lincRNAs [36], Pint is ubiquitously expressed. Even in the absence of p53 activation, Pint is relatively robust (see Additional file 1: Figure S2C). This suggests that Pint plays a role independently of p53 activation by DNA damage. In fact, inhibition of Pint in the absence of DNA damage causes an arrest in cell proliferation, as opposed to the effect of Pint overexpression. Furthermore, even in the presence of DNA damage, most of the genes found to be regulated by Pint are involved in cellular pathways not directly related to p53. This suggests that Pint is necessary for regulation of normal cell growth and proliferation, and in the presence of DNA damage, Pint acts as a negative regulator of cell cycle arrest and as a pro-survival molecule, modulating the effect of p53 activation through a negative autoregulatory mechanism., 
                Pint binds directly to PRC2, and is required for the targeting of PRC2 to specific genes for H3K27 tri-methylation and repression. The association of PRC2 with the promoter of these genes is lost when Pint is depleted from the cells, resulting in their transcriptional induction. Moreover, the biological effect of Pint depletion is strongly enhanced by PRC2 downregulation, whereas Pint overexpression has no effect in a PRC2 knockdown background. These results suggest that Pint cooperates with PRC2 in the repression of genes required for survival and proliferation., We found that of the total number of genes affected by Pint inhibition, 39% were upregulated and 61% downregulated upon Pint knockdown, suggesting that many Pint-regulated genes are indirect targets of Pint-induced gene repression Interestingly, the top functional terms of the genes downregulated by Pint are related to transcription regulation (transcription regulator activity, transcription factor activity, and DNA binding). By contrast, Pint-upregulated genes are mostly involved in functions related to extranuclear components of signaling cascades such as pattern binding and polysaccharide binding (see Additional file 1: Figure S4F,G). These data are consistent with a model in which Pint modulates the targeting of PRC2 to specific transcription regulators, affecting the gene-expression cascade at its top, and resulting in broad downstream effects., The precise mechanism by which Pint contributes to PRC2 targeting to specific loci remains to be defined. One possibility is that Pint binds to genomic sequences, either by Crick-Watson base pairing or DNA-RNA-DNA triple helical structures. The latter has been shown for other non-coding RNAs, resulting in transcriptional repression in the case of the dihydrofolate reductase gene, DHFR [39], or in epigenetic silencing in the case of ribosomal genes [40]. Additionally, we cannot exclude the possibility that Pint interacts with protein complexes other than PRC2,, acting as an RNA scaffold that brings together additional factors that may determine target specificity. In fact, this has been shown for the lincRNA HOTAIR, which interacts with the PRC2 and Lysine-specific demethylase 1 complexes [41]., We have identified the human PINT ortholog, which, despite relatively low overall sequence homology, shows several analogies with mouse lincRNA. Human PINT is not only transcriptionally induced by p53, but it conserves all three fully functional p53REs present in mouse. PINT significantly correlates positively or negatively with the same KEGG pathways that are affected by Pint knockdown in mouse cells. Furthermore, similarly to the mouse Pint, human PINT presents nuclear localization, and has previously been reported to interact with PRC2 [10]. The similarities between murine and human lincRNAs suggest that their study could help infer the molecular principles underlying lincRNA functions with low sequence dependency. Intriguingly, PINT appears to be significantly downregulated in primary colon tumors, and its overexpression in human tumor cells inhibits their proliferation. These observations contradict what might be expected based on a simplistic interpretation of the mouse in vitro phenotype, and could reflect species-specific aspects of cellular pathways and/or the known intrinsic biological differences between mouse in vitro models and human tumor cells [42]., In summary, we have identified a lincRNA, Pint, which establishes a new connection between the tumor suppressor p53 and epigenetic regulation by PRC2. Furthermore, the human ortholog of Pint may represent a crucial component of the p53 barrier against cancer."

Studies that rely upon a limited number of genetic loci do not always reveal actual evolutionary history, and often confuse inferences related to phylogeny and speciation. Whole-genome data, however, can overcome this issue by providing a nearly unbiased window into the patterns and processes of speciation. In order to reveal the complexity of the speciation process, we sequenced and analyzed the genomes of 10 wild pigs, representing morphologically or geographically well-defined species and subspecies of the genus Sus from insular and mainland Southeast Asia, and one African common warthog., Our data highlight the importance of past cyclical climatic fluctuations in facilitating the dispersal and isolation of populations, thus leading to the diversification of suids in one of the most species-rich regions of the world. Moreover, admixture analyses revealed extensive, intra- and inter-specific gene-flow that explains previous conflicting results obtained from a limited number of loci. We show that these multiple episodes of gene-flow resulted from both natural and human-mediated dispersal., Our results demonstrate the importance of past climatic fluctuations and human mediated translocations in driving and complicating the process of speciation in island Southeast Asia. This case study demonstrates that genomics is a powerful tool to decipher the evolutionary history of a genus, and reveals the complexity of the process of speciation.","","The diversity of life on Earth owes its existence to the process of speciation. The emergence of genetic techniques has allowed the relationships amongst hundreds of species to be investigated, and DNA studies have been invaluable in resolving long-standing taxonomic and phylogenetic questions (for example, [1, 2]. The use of limited numbers of genomic markers, however, can result in misleading impressions of the phylogenetic relationships between organisms [3]. In addition, traditional bifurcating trees are constructed on the presumption that little or no gene-flow occurs following a split between two species, though gene-flow has been shown to occur during the splits between species [4, 5]. The recent advent of high-throughput sequencing allows inferences to be drawn from near-complete genomes, in turn offering an unprecedented understanding of organismal evolutionary history. The commensurate increase in resolving power has allowed numerous questions to be addressed, including those related to genomic structure, deep phylogenetic relationships, the genetic variation responsible for specific phenotypes, and hybridization patterns between ancient hominids [6, 7]. Few studies, however, have taken advantage of complete genomes to investigate the process of speciation., Wallace [8] first recognized that Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) is an ideal natural laboratory to study speciation. Over the past 50 million years (My) tectonic activity has considerably altered the geography of this region. In addition, large-scale climatic fluctuations beginning in the early Pliocene [9] affected the region's biogeography [10]. Successive glacial and interglacial periods lowered and raised sea levels, thus alternately separating and connecting large landmasses. During cold periods, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra and Java formed the contiguous landmass known as Sundaland (Figure 1A), while in warmer periods these islands were isolated from each other. These alternating climatic conditions required frequent adaptation and induced intermittent allopatric and parapatric speciation processes. The fluctuations also created an ideal environment for diversification that has resulted in a complex and species-rich assemblage [10]. The development of models that explain the process of speciation in ISEA has been further complicated by anthropogenic factors that have influenced the dispersal and distribution of numerous species in the region [11].

                    , The five biodiversity hotspots found in ISEA and Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) [12] are host to at least seven morphologically defined species of pig in the genus Sus [13]. Aside from Sus scrofa (Eurasian wild boar and domestic pigs), which is distributed across most of Eurasia and parts of northern Africa, all other species of the genus Sus are restricted to MSEA and ISEA (Figure 1A). Because these species are still capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring [14], the genus Sus presents an excellent model to study on-going speciation. Moreover, previous studies have found discrepancies between and among the phylogenies inferred from morphological and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers [13, 15, 16]. Thus, the phylogeny of these species remains controversial. These discrepancies could be explained by either gene-flow between sympatric populations of different species or a rapid radiation that would have left little power to resolve the phylogeny., The lack of a post-zygotic reproductive barrier in pigs is not an isolated case. Indeed, many vertebrate taxa, recognized as different species, can still interbreed and produce fertile offspring. For example, it has been claimed that approximately 6% of European mammalian species can interbreed with at least one other species [17]. Additionally, while most of these species are young, there are examples of interbreeding species of birds that diverged over 55 million years ago (Mya) [18]. Given the ease with which numerous closely related (and some distantly related) species can interbreed, it is important to develop and test methods that are not only robust to inter-specific gene-flow, but can also identify it. Speciation with gene-flow is expected to result in a richer phylogenetic history including periods of divergence (bifurcations) and periods of secondary contact (reticulations), and thus should leave genomic signatures., In order to investigate the speciation history of these suids, and to assess the usefulness of whole-genome sequences to infer complex evolutionary histories, we sequenced and analyzed the complete genomes of 11 individual pigs representing five Sus species and an African common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus; Table S1 in Additional file 1). Our analysis of these 11 genomes demonstrates the power afforded by genomics to resolve a complex and controversial evolutionary history involving multiple reticulation events., Our results reveal that, unlike alternative strategies including SNP genotypes (from SNP microarrays), ascertained in a single species or population, that possess inherent biases in between species or population studies [31], whole-genome sequencing (leading to the detection of millions of polymorphisms) allow for phylogenetic relationships and admixture patterns within the genus Sus to be confidently resolved. Indeed, when attempting to recapitulate the analysis using the porcine 60K SNP chip [32] (Additional file 8), substantial differences in branch length estimates were found. These discrepancies are due to ascertainment bias demonstrating that a simple SNP array genotyping method, even for multiple individuals, would not have allowed the resolution afforded by a single complete genome. In addition, we show that there is a high degree of phylogenetic discordance across the genome. Such discordance could potentially lead to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between these species if only a subset of these loci were sampled [16]. While phylogenetic incongruence can frustrate taxonomic inference, it has the potential to test for the presence of inter-specific gene-flow. Our data demonstrate that the wealth of information extracted from these genomes allows for a thorough analysis (Additional files 4 and 5) that permits for the temporal reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Sus discussed below., The resolution afforded by complete genomes allowed us to infer not only ancient admixture episodes, but also those that took place as a result of more recent human-aided dispersal. Together, these findings provide insights related to the possible response to future climate and anthropogenic disturbances of mammalian taxa within ISEA., Despite the challenges in building a single phylogeny from entire genome sequences, we were able to obtain a well-resolved tree. In fact, the complexity of whole-genome data allows for a deeper appreciation of the complexities involved in the speciation process. Moreover, the substantial volume of data allows for robust time estimation. These findings reveal the power of multiple complete genomes from closely related species to comprehensively infer their speciation and evolutionary history and to resolve discrepancies between discordant trees constructed using smaller marker sets., The complete genomes presented here provide compelling evidence that speciation in ISEA suids did not proceed according to a simple bifurcating model. Instead, our data indicate that the process involved numerous periods of both diversification and reticulation amongst several species and is on-going. Extensive inter-specific gene-flow has also been reported in fish [43, 44] and birds [45, 46]. The resolution afforded by complete genomes reveals that speciation is rarely as simple or linear as our traditional depictions, and that complex patterns of diversification and reticulation are likely the rule and not the exception., The origin of new species often includes significant time periods during which closely related taxa in the initial stages of diversifying from one another can (and do) produce fertile offspring. The resolution provided by the use of whole genomes allows not only for an assessment of the current and past integrity of species, but also the elucidation of taxa-specific speciation history. Genomics can thus reveal the molecular variability of life on earth, elucidate the process by which it emerged, and inform our attempts to preserve it."

However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the role of this group of genes in different cancer types., We have analyzed 4,623 tumor samples from thirteen anatomical sites to determine which chromatin regulatory factors are candidate drivers in these different sites. We identify 34 chromatin regulatory factors that are likely drivers in tumors from at least one site, all with relatively low mutational frequency. We also analyze the relative importance of mutations in this group of genes for the development of tumorigenesis in each site, and in different tumor types from the same site., We find that, although tumors from all thirteen sites show mutations in likely driver chromatin regulatory factors, these are more prevalent in tumors arising from certain tissues. With the exception of hematopoietic, liver and kidney tumors, as a median, the mutated factors are less than one fifth of all mutated drivers across all sites analyzed. We also show that mutations in two of these genes, MLL and EP300, correlate with broad expression changes across cancer cell lines, thus presenting at least one mechanism through which these mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis in cells of the corresponding tissues.","","Highly conserved molecular mechanisms are responsible for maintaining genome integrity and tightly regulated gene expression, which is essential for cell survival. Those include the fine regulation of chromatin structure, mainly maintained through three distinct processes: the post-translational modification of histone tails, the replacement of core histones by histone variants, and the direct structural remodeling by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes
[1]. The proteins that control this system, broadly referred to as chromatin regulatory factors (CRFs), contribute to the establishment of chromatin structures that modulate the expression of large gene sets, either by establishing more inaccessible regions or by placing histone marks that open the chromatin and allow the binding of other factors. These CRFs help to maintain cellular identity, and mutations in them (commonly called epimutations) often lead to a de-regulation of gene expression that may contribute to tumorigenesis
[2]. CRFs are broadly classified in three main groups: histone tail modifiers (including histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases (HDACs), histone methyltransferases and histone demethylases, that deposit or remove acetyl or methyl groups, respectively); DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and putative demethylases (that affect cytosines at CpG islands); and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (responsible for the repositioning of nucleosomes)., Until recently, DNMT proteins had not been found mutated in cancer
[3], but DNMT3A, and later DNMT1 and DNMT3B, were reported as altered in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and in acute monocytic leukemia, where their mutation status also predicted prognosis
[4, 5]. Mutations in ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes are recurrent in, amongst others, ovarian and clear cell renal cancers
[2]. The regulation of the trimethylation of histone H3 at K27 mark (H3K27me3) by the Polycomb complex, a key component to maintain stem cell identity, is also frequently compromised in a variety of cancer types, including those from breast, bladder, pancreas, prostate and lymphomas
[6]. Histone demethylases have also been implicated in the development of a wide variety of tumors. Moreover, recent whole exome sequencing studies in large cohorts of tumor samples have highlighted as main findings the inactivating mutations on proteins that regulate the epigenomic state of cells
[7]. Alterations in KAT6B
[8], SMARCC1
[9] and NSD1
[10] have been described in uterine, cervical and skin pre-malignant lesions, respectively. This presents these proteins as potential biomarkers, thus adding early cancer detection to the possible uses of CRFs in the clinic., This current accumulation of evidence for the role of CRFs in cancer has attracted the attention of the scientific community towards CRFs as novel targets for cancer treatment. In 2006, the first HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), Vorinostat, was approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration to treat a specific type of lymphoma, and more than 20 molecules of this type are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation
[11]. Some DNMT inhibitors have been recently approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, and their combination with HDACi is a subject of intense study in clinical trials
[12]. Some studies raise hopes for the possible use of HDACis to overcome drug resistance
[13]. Interestingly, an in-depth review by Patel et al. on 46 potentially druggable yet chemically unexplored proteins in the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) identified six CRFs: ATRX, KAT6A, KDM6A, NSD3, PBRM1 and SMARCA4
[14]., Even though CRFs are emerging as important players in cancer development
[15–20], to our knowledge no systematic analysis on the alterations of a comprehensive catalog of CRFs in different tumors has been performed to date. Moreover, most studies have focused their efforts in the in-depth characterization of specific genes that appear mutated at high frequencies, underestimating the impact of lowly recurrent drivers (those genes whose mutation is likely to be functional, but occurs in few samples) on tumorigenesis. For instance, a very recent report
[21] focused only on the SWI/SNF family took into account the frequency of mutations of their members rather than their likelihood of driving tumorigenesis., In this paper, we carry out a systematic exploration of the role of CRFs in tumorigenesis in different tissues. To that end, we first compiled and manually curated a comprehensive list of CRFs, for which we annotated any previously known implications in cancer. Secondly, we analyzed 4,623 tumor samples from 13 anatomical sites to identify which of the CRFs are driver candidates in these different sites, employing two approaches recently introduced by us
[22, 23]. Finally, we took advantage of the profiles of genomic and transcriptomic alterations revealed by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
[24] to explore the effects of mutations in two likely driver CRFs on the expression of broad gene modules across 905 cancer cell lines., In this study, we found that several CRFs are likely involved in tumorigenesis in cancers from 13 anatomical sites. We uncovered these genes as putative causes of the studied malignancies through the use of the FM bias and CLUST bias analyses, rather than the mere recurrence of mutations in genes across tumor samples. Moreover, by focusing on multiprotein complexes formed by several CRFs, we found evidence that suggest that these, rather than individual genes, are the subjects of positive selection during tumorigenesis. These two approaches constitute novelties with respect to the most recent and comprehensive analysis
[21], which found recurrent mutations in SWI/SNF proteins across more than 650 tumor samples of 10 anatomical sites. Another important methodological novelty of our work consists in the use of CF ratios to assess the relevance of mutations in CRFs in tumorigenesis in cancers from different sites. The employment of this ratio normalizes the number of CRFs with PAMs in the samples of a site by its intrinsic burden of mutations in driver genes. It is thus possible to observe that PAMs in CRFs, although highly prevalent in carcinomas of the uterus, probably play a relatively small role in their tumorigenesis because these tumors bear mutations in many other driver genes. However, mutations in CRFs appear to play a bigger role in tumorigenesis in hematopoietic malignancies than they do in tumors from other sites, although only few hematopoietic tumors bear PAMs in CRFs (Figure 
4)., A group of pediatric medulloblastomas also possess abnormally high CF ratios, which implies that a high proportion of their mutated drivers are actually CRFs. It has been suggested that both pediatric and hematopoietic malignancies have very low mutational rates and therefore fewer drivers take part in their emergence than in solid adult tumors
[111]. One could hypothesize from our results that alteration of either the transcriptional control or the chromatin maintenance of broad gene modules - as we observed in cell lines - via mutations in CRFs may be the crucial step of tumorigenesis in at least some of these tumors. This hypothesis, which could be experimentally tested, is another important contribution of the present work., A third important contribution is the list of putative driver CRFs, which is available at IntOGen
[112]. In particular, two of them were uncovered as putative drivers in more than one site (CHD4 and ATF7IP) and are not annotated in the CGC
[82]. They therefore constitute interesting candidates for novel epigenetic drivers (Figure 
1). These additions to the list of driver CRFs might contribute to the research for anticancer drugs that takes CRFs as suitable targets., We present the first systematic approach to characterize the repertoire of CRFs that could constitute mutational cancer drivers in tumors from 13 anatomical sites. We found that likely driver CRFs appear across tumor samples from most of these 13 sites, although the number of affected samples is in general low, except in the case of tumors from several sites, such as bladder, kidney and uterus. Mutations in CRFs appear to be in general only one of several contributing mechanisms towards tumorigenesis in most cancer samples. Finally, we have proved that mutations in two CRFs correlate with broad expression changes across cancer cell lines, thus presenting at least one mechanism through which these mutations could contribute to tumorigenesis in cells of the corresponding tissues. Our results expand the current knowledge on the involvement of CRFs in tumorigenesis in several malignancies. Furthermore, they can contribute to formulate hypotheses on the mechanistic basis for this association. All the results presented here are available for browsing through the IntOGen-mutations platform
[83, 112] and using Gitools interactive heat-maps

The relationship between DNA methylation, cytogenetic background, drug resistance and relapse in ALL is poorly understood., We surveyed the DNA methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites in samples from 764 children at diagnosis of ALL and from 27 children at relapse. This survey uncovered four characteristic methylation signatures. First, compared with control blood cells, the methylomes of ALL cells shared 9,406 predominantly hypermethylated CpG sites, independent of cytogenetic background. Second, each cytogenetic subtype of ALL displayed a unique set of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites. The CpG sites that constituted these two signatures differed in their functional genomic enrichment to regions with marks of active or repressed chromatin. Third, we identified subtype-specific differential methylation in promoter and enhancer regions that were strongly correlated with gene expression. Fourth, a set of 6,612 CpG sites was predominantly hypermethylated in ALL cells at relapse, compared with matched samples at diagnosis. Analysis of relapse-free survival identified CpG sites with subtype-specific differential methylation that divided the patients into different risk groups, depending on their methylation status., Our results suggest an important biological role for DNA methylation in the differences between ALL subtypes and in their clinical outcome after treatment.","","Methylation of cytosine (5 mC) residues in CpG dinucleotides across the genome is an epigenetic modification that plays a pivotal role in the establishment of cellular identity by influencing gene expression during development [1]. In somatic mammalian cells, the majority of CpG sites are methylated. However, CpG sites located in regions of increased CG density, known as CpG islands, generally have low levels of CpG methylation [2]. On the molecular level, it is well known that CpG methylation leads to X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and suppression of transposable elements. Disruption of DNA methylation patterns is associated with diseases, and particularly with cancer [3]. Key regulators that are essential for establishing and maintaining the epigenomic landscape are frequently mutated and can drive cancer development via alterations of DNA methylation and histone modifications [4]., Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) originates from the malignant transformation of lymphocyte progenitor cells into leukemic cells in the B-cell and T-cell lineages. ALL is a heterogeneous disease, in which patients are stratified into subtype groups based on their cellular immunophenotype and recurrent cytogenetic aberrations, such as aneuploidies and translocations, acquired by the leukemic cells [5, 6]. In the Nordic countries, the five-year survival rate for pediatric ALL patients exceeds 80%, but one-fifth of the patients relapse despite continued chemotherapy [5]. Although the cytogenetic aberrations are indicative of better or poorer relapse-free survival rates, relapses occur in all cytogenetic subtypes [6]., We and others have previously observed differential patterns of CpG site methylation in ALL cells compared to non-leukemic bone marrow [7, 8], in subtypes of ALL [9–12], and between diagnosis and relapse [13]. However, the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns have not yet been comprehensively described for all subtypes of ALL and the synergy between DNA methylation, leukemogenesis, drug resistance, and relapse in ALL is poorly understood. Increased understanding of the role of aberrant DNA methylation is of considerable interest, especially in lieu of the possible application of epigenetic treatment in combination chemotherapy [14, 15]. In the present study we provide a comprehensive, genome-wide map of de novo DNA methylation changes in ALL cells at diagnosis and relapse by interrogating the methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites distributed genome-wide in a large collection of pediatric ALL cells of diverse cytogenetic backgrounds., The 450k BeadChips for DNA methylation analysis are particularly suitable for analysis of large sample sets for which next generation bisulfite sequencing is not yet feasible. In the present study, we examined the methylation status of 435,941 CpG sites to determine the methylation patterns in a large set of samples from patients with childhood ALL at diagnosis (n = 764), relapse (n = 27), and in non-leukemic reference samples (n = 137). The quantitative methylation data from the 450k BeadChips in our large set of ALL samples at diagnosis revealed that the average absolute β-value difference between ALL cells and reference cells for the subtype-specific DMCs is approximately 0.50. Similarly, the β-value difference from pair-wise analysis of ALL cells at diagnosis and at relapse is close to 0.5. Based on these observations we speculate that differential methylation occurs in an allele-specific manner in ALL, analogously to what has been recently suggested by integrative analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms and methylation using next-generation sequencing in prostate cancer [27]. Our speculation on allele-specific DNA methylation is also substantiated by the quantitative correlation between DNA methylation and allele-specific gene expression that we observed in an earlier study of close to 200 of the diagnostic ALL samples analyzed here [28]., We analyzed multiple cytogenetic subtypes of ALL and found a core methylation signature shared by all the subtypes. This set of 'constitutive' DMCs, which comprised approximately 25% of all DMCs in each ALL subtype, were predominantly hypermethylated and associated with promoters repressed by the polycomb group proteins (PcG) in the context of bivalent chromatin. In stem cells, the repressive PcG complex cooperates with OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG to silence lineage-specific genes and to preserve the pluripotent state of the cells. Hypermethylation preferentially targets CpG islands of PcG-regulated genes in solid cancers [29–31] and in leukemias [13, 32, 33], which suggests a common signature of hypermethylation across cancer types by which cells lose their plasticity, giving them the ability to differentiate while retaining unlimited self-renewal capacity [31]. Although the expression of the majority of the PcG-regulated genes did not appear to be down-regulated in our data set, other studies [29, 31, 34] have shown that these genes are usually expressed at very low levels in normal cells, and become fully silenced upon aberrant DNA methylation in cancer cells. In our digital gene expression (DGE) data, the low expression levels of these genes (<0.5 transcripts per million) inhibited accurate quantification of differential expression., To our knowledge, our study is the first to observe a signature with higher DNA methylation levels of PcG target genes at relapse of ALL than at diagnosis. ALL cells at relapse are generally more resistant to chemotherapeutic treatment, which is consistent with the association between drug resistance and hypermethylation that is beginning to emerge in hematological neoplasms [13, 35–37]. Hypermethylation may be reversible by pretreatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (vorinostat) and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (decitabine) before standard chemotherapy [14]. In total, 74 of the genes in the constitutive and/or relapse DMC signatures that we identified in the current study have been experimentally shown to be targets for demethylation by decitabine (P < 3.96 × 10-9). As recent evidence suggests that cancer cells become dependent on DNA methylation acquired at specific positions [38], targeting the DNA methylation machinery may provide novel treatment options for cancers with hypermethylation phenotypes, especially for those patients who have relapsed [39]., In our study we established that additional hypermethylation in enhancers (marked by H3K4me3/H3K27ac) and in gene bodies are strongly associated with gene expression. Enhancers are distal elements that regulate gene expression and are influenced by aberrant DNA methylation in several cancer types [2, 40–42]. We show here that DNA methylation of enhancers is associated with differential gene expression in ALL. We also found that hypomethylation is prevalent outside CpG islands in gene bodies, and can be associated with either increased or decreased gene expression. This observation suggests a complex relationship between methylation in gene bodies in the regulation of gene expression, which may be acting via alternative promoter usage, splicing, and activity of other regulatory elements [40]. Because the regions with histone marks to which DMCs in ALL cells were enriched originated from normal fractionated blood cells [17], our results warrant an investigation of histone marks in primary ALL cells, which like DNA methylation are potentially altered in ALL., The DNA methylation status of individual candidate genes has been demonstrated to predict clinical outcome and allow refined subgrouping of ALL in a clinical setting [10, 43, 44]. We utilized the signatures of differentially methylated CpG sites identified in our study to screen for new markers of relapse in ALL, and found that subtype-specific DMCs may be useful as prognostic markers. We detected differential methylation of multiple CpG sites clustered in the ERHV-3, DMNBP, KCNA3, PAG1, and C11orf52 gene regions that were associated with increased risk of relapse in patients with the t(12;21) translocation treated according to standard risk (SR) therapy. In other patient subgroups we did not observe any significant association between DMCs and clinical outcome (P < 0.05). Patients with HeH and t(12;21) represent the two largest subgroups in pediatric BCP ALL (Table 1), and a majority of them are stratified to standard risk (SR) therapy. One possible explanation for the lack of DMCs with predictive power in patients with HeH is that this subtype group is less homogeneous than the t(12;21) group, and that various combinations of extra chromosomes in HeH cause differences in treatment response, something we will try to explore further. In all other BCP ALL subgroups, patient numbers were considerably smaller, which hinders analysis by repeated cross-validation. As in other contemporary ALL protocols, the current NOPHO ALL2008 protocol includes more intense treatment with asparaginase for all patients than the earlier treatment protocols that were used for the patients included in this study [45]. When follow-up times are long enough, it will be interesting to see if the same genes continue to have prognostic significance for patients treated on the most recent NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. Several studies have reported cancer-associated hypomethylation, expression, and a link to poor outcome for some of the human endogenous retrovirus families [46]. Although hypomethylation or expression of ERVH-3 has not previously been associated with outcome in t(12;21) BCP ALL, this gene was originally discovered in the REH ALL cell line bearing the t(12;21) translocation [24]. A recent study in acute myeloid leukemia showed that decitabine treatment of acute myeloid leukemia cells causes hypomethylation and up-regulation of ERVH-3 expression [47]. Our findings of hypomethylation in the ERVH-3 gene as a marker of relapse in t(12;21) warrant exploration of the side effects of decitabine treatment on abnormal hypomethylation of endogenous retroviral genes., We generated a comprehensive view of the methylation landscape in pediatric ALL compared to non-leukemic reference cells. The analysis identified prevalent hypermethylation of CpG sites at diagnosis and relapse in all subtypes of pediatric ALL. We also detected discrete differences in methylation that drives differential gene expression in a subtype-specific pattern. Moreover, hypomethylation of several genes appeared to be predictive of relapse in a subset of patients with the common t(12;21)ETV6/RUNX1 translocation. Whether the de novo methylation detected here contributes actively to ALL, or is a passenger in the malignant transformation of blood progenitor cells into ALL cells remains to be elucidated. Our study implies that aberrant DNA methylation is a signature of leukemic development and progression, and for the heterogeneity between patients of similar cytogenetic backgrounds that contributes to relapse."

Such genetic reassortment is exploited in breeding to combine favorable alleles, and in genetic research to identify genetic factors underlying traits of interest via linkage or association-based approaches. Crossover numbers and distributions along chromosomes vary between species, but little is known about their intraspecies variation., Here, we report on the variation of recombination rates between 22 European maize inbred lines that belong to the Dent and Flint gene pools. We genotype 23 doubled-haploid populations derived from crosses between these lines with a 50 k-SNP array and construct high-density genetic maps, showing good correspondence with the maize B73 genome sequence assembly. By aligning each genetic map to the B73 sequence, we obtain the recombination rates along chromosomes specific to each population. We identify significant differences in recombination rates at the genome-wide, chromosome, and intrachromosomal levels between populations, as well as significant variation for genome-wide recombination rates among maize lines. Crossover interference analysis using a two-pathway modeling framework reveals a negative association between recombination rate and interference strength., To our knowledge, the present work provides the most comprehensive study on intraspecific variation of recombination rates and crossover interference strength in eukaryotes. Differences found in recombination rates will allow for selection of high or low recombining lines in crossing programs. Our methodology should pave the way for precise identification of genes controlling recombination rates in maize and other organisms.","","In sexually reproducing organisms, crossovers (COs) stabilize the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis and ensure their correct segregation. By reciprocal exchange of parental genetic material, the COs also lead to new allelic combinations and thus play an important role in creating genetic diversity. Meiotic recombination occurs during prophase I of meiosis, when DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the topo-isomerase-related enzyme SPO11 [1] are repaired via reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. The final number of recombination events depends on (1) the number of DSBs, and (2) the proportion of DSBs that are repaired as COs. The remaining DSBs may be repaired via other pathways leading to small conversions called non-crossovers, or may even be repaired using the sister chromatid instead of the homologous chromosome [2]. In organisms such as mice, humans, or plants, the number of DSBs is at least 10 times higher than the number of COs [3–5]. The number of COs can vary under the control of genetic factors [5] that affect recombination rate, but there is also some homeostasis of the CO number that modulates the CO/DSB ratio [6]. CO interference is a phenomenon observed in almost all organisms, by which two successive COs on a chromosome are rarely very close to each other [7, 8]. The standard picture considers that close to a DSB that is repaired as a CO, other DSBs are preferentially repaired as non-crossovers [9–11], so interference may play a role in the regulation of CO numbers and distributions. Two distinct pathways of CO formation have been found to coexist in most species investigated, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae[12, 13], Solanum lycopersicum[14], Arabidopsis thaliana[15], and Mus musculus[16]. In plants, the majority of COs are formed via pathway 1, which depends on genes of the ZMM family (hereafter referred to as P1), and which are subject to interference [11, 14, 17]. The remaining COs are formed via pathway 2 (hereafter referred to as P2), which depends on the Mus81 gene, and in which there is little or no interference [18]., The meiotic recombination rate is known to vary among species [19, 20]. In mammals, some intraspecific variation of local recombination rate has been revealed by sperm typing and has been explained by cis and trans genetic factors. In particular, the allelic diversity in the zinc finger domain of PRDM9, a DNA-binding protein, has been shown to influence recombination hot-spot activity [21, 22]. In plants no PRDM9 homologs have been identified so far and little is known about the variation of the genome-wide recombination rates (GWRRs) within species. Most data come from chiasmata counts or linkage mapping experiments [20, 23]. However, to our knowledge, there are hardly any cases in plants where many crosses involving distantly related parents have been used to compare recombination rates and infer the patterns of recombination along chromosomes based on high-density linkage maps. The same holds for CO interference: even though it plays an important role in determining recombination rate, intraspecific variation of interference has rarely been investigated in plants. Understanding the landscape of recombination within a species is of intrinsic interest, and it is also important in the context of genome-based prediction [24] and genome-wide association studies [25], since recombination determines the extent of linkage disequilibrium in populations under study. The extent of linkage disequilibrium has an impact on the linkage phase between predictive markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) and on the marker densities required to find significant associations between markers and traits of interest., Maize (Zea mays L.) has been the subject of genetic studies for more than a hundred years [26]. It is a diploid species (n = 10) with ancient polyploid origin [27]. The first genetic linkage map in maize based on DNA markers was constructed using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers [28]. Since then, many more genetic maps have been published based on restriction fragment length polymorphism, amplified fragment length polymorphism, or simple sequence repeat markers [29, 30]. With increasing amounts of maize sequence information, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed and used for diversity analysis and genetic mapping in maize [31, 32]. Recently, the Illumina® MaizeSNP50 genotyping array comprising around 50,000 SNPs was developed and the first high-density genetic maps of maize were published using two intermated recombinant inbred line populations [33]. These maps comprised up to 21,000 SNP markers and were compared with the maize genome reference sequence generated from the US inbred line B73, which is the largest and most complex plant genome sequenced so far [34]. The B73 AGP v2 assembly covers 2.07 Gb of the approximately 2.5 Gb maize genome., For studying intraspecific variation of recombination rate in maize, we created two half-sib panels, one for Dent and one for Flint inbred lines. Dent and Flint are two maize gene pools that are important for hybrid breeding in Europe [35]. The two half-sib panels comprised a total of 24 full-sib families. The Dent panel comprises 10 crosses of a central Dent inbred line (F353) with diverse Dent founder inbreds of the European Dent gene pool that were developed in Europe and North America. In the Flint panel a central Flint inbred line (UH007) was crossed to 11 genetically diverse Flint founder inbreds of the European Flint breeding material. The Flint founder lines originate from early maize introductions to Spain as well as from so-called Northern Flints from France and Germany. In addition, two reciprocal crosses between the two central Dent and Flint lines were analyzed and in each panel one cross with the US Dent line B73 was included as a connection to the US nested association mapping (NAM) population [32]., Here, we report on the analysis of the variation of recombination rate in 23 populations of maize using SNPs from the MaizeSNP50 BeadChip [33]. All populations consist of doubled haploid (DH) lines obtained by in vivo haploid induction [36]. DH lines produced with this method reflect female meiosis. Unlike F2 or RILs, DH lines have the great advantage that the genetic information of each gamete is directly observed. Our objectives were to analyze intraspecific variation for (1) GWRR and chromosome-wide recombination rate, (2) recombination landscape along chromosomes, and (3) CO interference, using high-density genetic linkage maps. We found significant differences of GWRR between individual populations as well as between Dent × Dent versus Flint × Flint populations, but not between the Dent and Flint gene pools in general. GWRR was not correlated with the genetic structure of the lines as inferred from admixture analysis. We analyzed the recombination landscapes in all populations and found significant differences between individual populations and between pools. Finally, we characterized quantitatively the interfering and non-interfering CO formation pathways and found a negative correlation over all chromosomes between interference intensity of pathway P1 and GWRR., We constructed two half-sib panels comprising a total of 24 maize full-sib families of DH lines for the analysis of intraspecific variation of recombination rates. The full-sib families within the two panels represent the diversity of important founder lines of the European Dent and Flint germplasm, respectively (Table 1; Additional file 1). In the Dent panel (prefix CFD), all full-sib families have the same common parental line F353 which was crossed to diverse Dent founder lines. The common parent of the Flint full-sib families (prefix CFF) is line UH007, which was crossed to diverse Flint founder lines. In all crosses, the haploid inducer line was used as male parent when crossed with the F1 plants for in vivo haploid induction, so our maps reflect only female meioses. Details on the diversity analysis of the parental lines are given in Additional file 2.Table 1

                  , Recombination and reassortment of parental genomes lead to an increase of genetic variation. Understanding the mechanisms regulating recombination rate during meiosis would allow their manipulation to increase or decrease recombination rates according to specific requirements described in [39]. Although many genes controlling the basic process of CO formation have been identified, little is known about factors influencing CO numbers and distribution, and GWRR. To our knowledge the present work is the most comprehensive study comparing meiotic recombination rates and CO interference within one species and between gene pools of the same species. We used two panels of maize half-sib families comprising 23 full-sib populations with a total of 2,233 DH lines to analyze intraspecific variation of recombination rates and recombination landscapes. The parents of the two panels for Dent and Flint maize were chosen to represent the diversity present in European maize germplasm. We analyzed DH lines produced by in vivo haploid induction, which reflect a single female meiosis. As expected, the average number of crossovers per DH line in our study (15.1) was about half the number observed in maize RILs (28.9) [32]. This drawback of DH lines is counterbalanced by the faster development of the DH populations compared to RILs and by the complete homozygosity of DH lines, which are an immortal resource. Moreover, working on DH populations offers the unique possibility to analyze CO interference, while this is impossible in RILs because the successive independent meioses superpose the COs arising during each meiosis. The design of our connected half-sib panels comprising a large number of populations allowed for comparisons of GWRR, recombination landscape, and interference (1) across parents within each panel and (2) across panels via crosses of the central lines with line B73., As a prerequisite for our approach, we constructed high-density genetic maps for a large number of populations. Genetic map lengths of the 23 populations varied from 1,180 cM to 1,893 cM with a mean of 1,508 cM, which is in the range observed in other high-density genetic maps of maize [32, 33]. Due to IBD regions in some of our populations, gaps were observed in the genetic maps. However, since most of these gaps were in pericentromeric regions, where recombination rates are low, most of them were not larger than 15 cM, the most extreme gap (53.7 cM) being on chromosome 7 in CFF13. For 76 markers, we found chromosome assignments different from their annotation in the B73 AGPv2. We provided genetic coordinates for 118 markers where no annotation was available. These results may help to improve future B73 genome assemblies. In addition, genetic maps for several chromosomal regions were found non-colinear with the B73 sequence, as was previously detected from two other maize populations [33]. These discrepancies may be the consequence of mis-assemblies in the B73 genome, or due to lack of locus specificity for some SNP markers that would fall into duplicated genomic regions. The hypothesis of structural rearrangements between some of the parental lines and B73 cannot be excluded. However, given the design of the experiment, the possibility that both parents of a cross within one of the half-sib panels share a structural variation absent from both parents of another cross in the same panel is very limited., Meiosis and recombination fundamentally influence genome structure and evolution of species. Although key components of the meiotic pathway are known in plants, further research is needed to better understand the interplay of genetic factors controlling recombination, the role and mechanism of CO interference and the influence of chromatin features such as methylation and structural variation on recombination in plants. Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and next-generation sequencing offer new opportunities to analyze at a large scale the genome-wide distribution of COs and to characterize sequence motifs around CO hotspots. The present study revealed large intraspecific variation for GWRR and recombination landscapes in maize. Our findings pave the way for the selection of proper crossing parents to analyze genetic factors influencing GWRR and local recombination rates. Finally, using appropriate experimental designs, QTL or association studies will enable the identification of QTL for GWRR."

Recent evidence suggests that other mechanisms, such as RNA polymerase II pausing, might be operational in this process, but their regulation remains poorly understood., Here we identify the non-coding snRNA 7SK as a multifaceted regulator of transcription in embryonic stem cells. We find that 7SK represses a specific cohort of transcriptionally poised genes with bivalent or activating chromatin marks in these cells, suggesting a novel poising mechanism independent of Polycomb activity. Genome-wide analysis shows that 7SK also prevents transcription downstream of polyadenylation sites at several active genes, indicating that 7SK is required for normal transcriptional termination or control of 3′-UTR length. In addition, 7SK suppresses divergent upstream antisense transcription at more than 2,600 loci, including many that encode divergent long non-coding RNAs, a finding that implicates the 7SK snRNA in the control of transcriptional bidirectionality., Our study indicates that a single non-coding RNA, the snRNA 7SK, is a gatekeeper of transcriptional termination and bidirectional transcription in embryonic stem cells and mediates transcriptional poising through a mechanism independent of chromatin bivalency.","","Pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are able to generate all the cell types of the adult organism, and thus can acquire different cell fates upon appropriate stimuli. The majority (85%) of annotated genes in ESCs experience transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) [1]. Nevertheless, only a subset of these genes is expressed in a robust manner, and Pol II has been reported as being paused at 39% of the annotated genes [1]. Transcription start sites (TSSs) of many genes that are expressed at very low levels are bivalent for activatory (tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, H3K4me3) and inhibitory (tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27, H3K27me3) histone modifications [2], with transcription being repressed primarily by Polycomb complexes catalyzing tri-methylation of H3K27 [3, 4]. However, the chromatin structure of pluripotent cells is globally ‘open’ and more transcriptionally permissive [5, 6], and has been recently suggested to be refractory to repression by Polycomb, relative to differentiated cells [7]. Moreover, in an induced ground pluripotent state [8], lineage-specification genes exhibit even lower expression and, paradoxically, reduced H3K27me3 [9]. In these conditions increased Pol II pausing is seen at these loci, which may be an alternative mechanism for maintenance of the transcriptional poised state., Although recruitment of the Pol II machinery to the TSS is the most widely studied mode of transcriptional regulation, pausing of Pol II has recently emerged as a central step in this process [10]. The small nuclear non-coding RNA (ncRNA) Rn7SK/7SK has an important role in the regulation of transcriptional pausing [11–13], but its function in pluripotent cells has not been assessed. 7SK is an abundant RNA of around 330 nucleotides, which is transcribed by Pol III and is highly conserved across jawed vertebrates [14]. 7SK is present in a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex with proteins such as hexamethylene bis-acetamide inducible 1 mRNA (HEXIM) 1/2, La-related protein 7, and methylphosphate capping enzyme [12]. The 7SK snRNP has been shown to sequester positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a kinase complex that phosphorylates Pol II, thereby preventing elongation [11, 13, 15, 16]. Binding of the 7SK RNA to HEXIM leads to a conformational change of this protein, facilitating its binding to and inactivation of the kinase domain of P-TEFb [12, 17, 18]., In this study, we investigated the role of 7SK in mouse ESC transcription. We found that 7SK not only regulates the transcription of a specific subset of genes with bivalent marks, but also of genes solely with active chromatin marks. Furthermore, 7SK prevents widespread upstream divergent transcription and affects transcriptional termination of specific genes. Our study places the ncRNA 7SK in a central position in the control of transcription in ESCs., Several classes of regulatory RNAs are emerging as important regulators of gene expression, cell-fate determination, and development [24–31]. ncRNAs, including microRNAs [32] and lncRNAs [26], have been recently implicated in the control of pluripotency. Our study shows that a single ncRNA, 7SK, controls different aspects of transcription at specific loci in ESCs (Figure 7). 7SK represses a very specific cohort of genes, including several that are pivotal in lineage specification. A substantial proportion of the genes whose expression levels increased after 7SK knockdown do not have bivalent chromatin marks, but rather have H3K4me3, indicating that 7SK may inhibit transcription at a novel subset of gene loci where Polycomb repression is not operational. These results are consistent with recent findings that pluripotent chromatin in general is refractory to repression by Polycomb [7], and that H3K27me3 is reduced at genes whose expression is lower in an induced ground pluripotent state [9]. However, although elongation has been characterized as a major regulator of transcription of active genes in ESCs [9, 19], our data suggest that 7SK is not required for the fine-tuning of transcription of these genes.

                        has a central role in controlling transcription in embryonic stem cells.
                        7SK is required for the repression of genes that are silent or expressed at a low level. Widespread failed transcriptional termination was also seen after 7SK knockdown. 7SK is a major regulator of transcriptional directionality, by preventing the transcription of upstream divergent RNAs (udRNAs).
                    , P-TEFb has been shown to regulate transcription and cell fate during embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans[33], Drosophila[34] and zebrafish [35], and 7SK expression is increased upon ESC differentiation into neural (neuronal and glial) lineages [30]. Therefore, we extended our analysis to neural committed cell types: neural stem cells (NSCs) [36] and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) [37]. In contrast to ESCs, we did not observe effects on the expression of Olig2 total RNA, which is expressed in higher levels in these cells, after 7SK knockdown (see Additional file 13: Figure S7). Other genes expressed at higher levels in these cells, such as Sox9 (NSCs) and Sox2 (OPCs), were also not affected by 7SK. However, there was an increase in nascent transcript levels for specification genes such as Nr4a2, Hes1, and Irx2 after 7SK knockdown in NSCs (see Additional file 13: Figure S7). We found a similar increase in nascent transcription of Dll1 and of genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, such as the genes encoding for myelin basic protein (Mbp) and 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (Cnp) after 7SK knockdown in OPCs (see Additional file 13: Figure S7). These results indicate that the repression of lineage specification/differentiation genes by 7SK is maintained in neural lineage cell populations. In a manner analogous to Polycomb activity [38], 7SK repression appears to affect different cohorts of genes depending on the transcriptional and developmental state of the cell., These results indicate that 7SK plays an important role in the control of transcription of lineage specification/differentiation genes in stem/progenitor cells. It has been previously shown that disruption of the 7SK snRNP is rapidly compensated for by the increased expression of another component of the complex, HEXIM1 [39]. We found upregulation of Hexim1 total RNA in both ESCs (Figure 1D; see Additional file 11: Figure S6) and in OPCs (see Additional file 13: Figure S7), suggesting a similar feedback mechanism to control P-TEFb availability after 7SK depletion., This study also identified two completely novel functions of 7SK in preventing downstream (sense) and upstream (antisense) transcription, at specific and distinct active loci. The increased downstream sense transcription seen after 7SK knockdown might be associated with failed transcriptional termination by Pol II [40] or lengthening of 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) [41]. The latter appears to be considerably more frequent in neural lineages than in ESCs [41]. 7SK might thus be a key component in restricting 3′ UTR length in certain cell types, including ESCs, through a mechanism less active in differentiated neural cell types., Widespread upstream divergent antisense transcription has previously been described in several species [21, 42–49]. In ESCs, this phenomenon was primarily found to produce short RNAs (20 to 90 nucleotides) [50]. Recent studies indicated that some of these transcripts can extend up to 1,100 kb [51], and that a majority of lncRNAs expressed in mouse ESCs derive from bidirectional transcription at active gene promoters [21, 52]. The results here extend these findings, identifying novel loci of divergent upstream transcription, extending over several kb upstream of the TSS. They also indicate that 7SK plays a role in the expression of a subset of these divergent lncRNAs. lncRNA/mRNA gene pairs have been reported to show coordinated expression after differentiation of ESCs [21]. However, our data indicate that 7SK represses divergent lncRNA expression specifically, rather than that of the associated mRNA, implying that neighboring lncRNA and coding genes can be regulated through different mechanisms. Moreover, the degradation of divergent antisense RNAs can be mediated by the exosome [42, 46, 49, 51], and our results suggest that this might be complemented by the activity of 7SK in preventing divergent upstream transcription. 7SK knockdown also led to upregulation of udRNAs in NSCs and OPCs (see Additional file 13: Figure S7), suggesting that repression of antisense transcription is a general function of 7SK., P-TEFb kinase complex is involved in the functions of 7SK described here, as treatment with the P-TEFb inhibitor flavopiridol (Figure 3, Figure 6) [51] suppressed the transcription of poised genes and udRNAs after 7SK knockdown. In addition, I-BET151 prevented the upregulation of udRNAs by 7SK knockdown (Figure 6), indicating that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4)-mediated P-TEFb recruitment is involved in the 7SK upregulation of udRNAs. This effect was not as prominent for Dll1 (see Additional file 11: Figure S6), which might reflect an alternative role of BRD4 in the association of P-TEFb with the inactive 7SK complex [39, 53], rather than inhibition of the recruitment of P-TEFb to the chromatin. Alternative and/or complementary mechanisms to P-TEFb are also likely to be required for 7SK-mediated repression. For instance, divergent transcription and failed termination, which are both affected by 7SK, can be inhibited via gene looping [54, 55]. The polyadenylation complex factor Ssu72, which is a phosphatase of Pol II, has been shown to be pivotal to these processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae[54, 55]. Interestingly, transcriptional termination and elongation in HIV can also be regulated by a regulatory region of the HIV RNA genome, TAR[56], which has some structural similarities with 7SK[12], and has been proposed to displace 7SK to enable trans-activation of HIV genes [57]. While this paper was under revision, Sharp and colleagues published a paper describing a novel regulatory system that controls promoter directionality, based on enrichment of canonical polyadenylation signals and Pol II termination upstream of genes, and enrichment of U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) sites downstream of the TSS, preventing premature termination of the sense RNA [58]. Interestingly, SR proteins, which interact with the U1 small ribonucleoprotein, have recently been shown to be components of the 7SK complex [59]. These mechanisms might be operational in the repression of upstream transcription and control of termination by 7SK., Most of the 7SK snRNP sequesters P-TEFb in an inactive complex in the nucleoplasm [15–17, 23, 60, 61], and in nuclear speckles [13]. 7SK knockdown leads to reorganization of proteins associated with interchromatin granule clusters, including SR proteins [13], and these events could be involved in the transcriptional events we found here. Nevertheless, our results also indicate that 7SK repression operates at specific loci in the genome, and thus, specific recruitment mechanisms may be in place. Indeed, it has been recently shown that 7SK ncRNA is a chromatin component [62], and transiently associates with repressed genes [13]. Moreover, the 7SK snRNP component HEXIM1 can be located at active gene promoters in mouse embryonic fibroblasts [59]. Chromatin-modifying enzymes, some of which have been shown to interact with ncRNAs in mouse ESCs [26] and/or transcription factors, are also among the candidates for potentially targeting 7SK to specific loci to act as gene-specific transcriptional repressor. 7SK has been recently shown to interact with the transcription factor high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) and to modulate its transcriptional activity in both P-TEFb-dependent and P-TEFb-independent manners [63–65]. The transcription factor c-Myc has also been shown to recruit P-TEFb to active genes in mouse ESCs, and to modulate transcriptional elongation [19]. Interestingly, c-Myc expression is decreased in ESCs cultured in 2i/LIF, but promotes elongation only of a small subset of genes in ESCs grown in serum-containing media [9], which implies that there are other unknown factors regulating the promoter-specific poising. P-TEFb can also be recruited by the super elongation complex (SEC) to paused active genes in mouse ESCs, while after differentiation, SEC is recruited to activated developmental genes [66]. Further investigation will determine if some of these molecules contribute to the mechanism by which 7SK regulates the diverse transcriptional outcomes identified here, and whether these are related or independent events., Our study reveals that the ncRNA 7SK acts as a repressor of a cohort of poised genes in ESCs, and unexpectedly modulates several other processes, including upstream (antisense) and downstream (sense) transcription. The actions of 7SK, although widespread, primarily affect specific sets of genes, indicating that mechanisms for targeting 7SK to discrete genomic loci might be in place."

We compared CpG methylation changes with age across 283 human blood, brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle samples using methylation arrays to identify tissue-specific age effects., We found age-associated CpGs (ageCGs) that are both tissue-specific and common across tissues. Tissue-specific ageCGs are frequently located outside CpG islands with decreased methylation, and common ageCGs show the opposite trend. AgeCGs are significantly associated with poorly expressed genes, but those with decreasing methylation are linked with higher tissue-specific expression levels compared with increasing methylation. Therefore, tissue-specific gene expression may protect against common age-dependent methylation. Distinguished from other tissues, skeletal muscle ageCGs are more associated with expression, enriched near genes related to myofiber contraction, and closer to muscle-specific CTCF binding sites. Kidney-specific ageCGs are more increasingly methylated compared to other tissues as measured by affiliation with kidney-specific expressed genes. Underlying chromatin features also mark common and tissue-specific age effects reflective of poised and active chromatin states, respectively. In contrast with decreasingly methylated ageCGs, increasingly methylated ageCGs are also generally further from CTCF binding sites and enriched within lamina associated domains., Our data identified common and tissue-specific DNA methylation changes with age that are reflective of CpG landscape and suggests both common and unique alterations within human tissues. Our findings also indicate that a simple epigenetic drift model is insufficient to explain all age-related changes in DNA methylation.","Aging, Methylation, Muscle, Kidney, Blood, Brain, LADs, Chromatin, H3K27Me3, Sequencing","Methylation is a major biochemical alteration that governs multi-tiered epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Methylation of specific lysine resides within core histones such as H3 and H4 induce conformational modifications in chromatin structure that are associated with regulation of transcriptional activity
[1]. Direct methylation of DNA itself is one foundational epigenetic modification that typically involves conversion of cytosine to 5′-methylcytosine catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases
[2]. DNA methylation in adult tissues usually occurs within the context of CpG dinucleotide sequences (CpGs) clustered in regions known as CpG islands (CGIs) that are most often found proximal to promoters of housekeeping genes
[3]. For the majority of genes, hypermethylation of CpG islands is linked with transcriptional silencing. During embryogenesis, DNA is passively demethylated during early cell divisions until de novo DNA methylation establishes the CpG methylation marks within dividing cells that guide restriction of gene expression patterns associated with tissue-specific lineages
[4, 5]. During maintenance of tissues, CpG methylation marks must also be maintained by DNA methyltransferases during DNA replication in dividing adult stem cells to preserve the identity and function of differentiating cell types and for self-renewal of adult stem cell populations
[6–8]., The context of DNA methylation in relation to CGIs has emerged as a defining feature within genome-wide DNA methylation studies. Approximately 65 to 70% of promoters are associated with CGIs, and these promoter types are generally hypomethylated, while promoters that contain a low CpG density are hypermethylated
[9, 10]. Comparison of differential DNA methylation patterns between induced pluripotent stem cells and their parental fibroblasts showed an overlap of CpGs with tissue- and cancer-specific methylation patterns in regions located within 2 kb of CGIs known as CpG shores (CGSs)
[11]. Intriguingly, the same methylation changes in CpGs during cellular differentiation overlap with those most frequently altered in cancer cells, and suggests that aberrant DNA methylation could be an underlying factor in the genesis of cancer stem cells
[12–14]. Outside of CGIs and CGSs, including gene bodies, DNA methylation is often a characteristic of active transcription with sharp transitions in methylation between exon and intron boundaries
[15, 16]., Early epigenetic studies showed an effect of aging on the stability of X-linked chromosome gene inactivation
[17]. An increase in DNA methylation differences between young and old monozygotic twin pairs established a strong link between phenotypic discordance, epigenetics, and aging
[18]. This relationship between DNA methylation and age raises questions of how epigenetic changes may specifically influence different tissue types over time, especially in adult tissues composed mainly of postmitotic cells such as neurons and multinucleated myofibers. It has been proposed that epigenetic changes with age, including DNA methylation, may be a stochastic process of random epigenetic 'drift'
[19, 20]. Comparisons of DNA methylation between normal versus cancer tissue or between epithelial to mesenchymal cell transitions during development suggest shared methylation 'noise' within the same CpGs is indicative of some level of modulated cellular plasticity
[21]. Furthermore, subtle methylation changes may be functionally important, as has been shown in the adult brain where stimulus-induced methylation may be related to neuronal plasticity
[22]. All of these findings suggest a highly dynamic epigenome, even within fully differentiated, post-mitotic cells., Here we compare DNA methylation alterations with age across brain, blood, kidney, and skeletal muscle tissues with array-based DNA methylation profiling that interrogated 26,486 autosomal CpGs covering approximately 14,000 genes. We found a significant number of age-associated CpGs (ageCGs) near genes that are commonly involved in developmental processes, transcription, and morphogenesis. The majority of these CpGs are increasingly methylated with age (positive ageCGs) and positioned within CGIs. However, ageCGs that were found within non-CGIs mostly displayed decreasing methylation with age (negative ageCGs) and were enriched in tissue-specific ageCGs. Skeletal muscle exhibited negative ageCGs that were found within non-CGIs and associated with genes that code for components required for myofiber contraction. In three of the tissues, ageCGs were enriched in genes that are not highly expressed in that tissue, according to Illumina Body Map 2.0 data. However, the strongest relationship between ageCGs and genes that are expressed was within skeletal muscle. Genes near negative ageCGs generally had higher expression levels than positive ageCGs. Analysis of tissue-specific chromatin states generated using Roadmap Epigenomics project data showed marks associated with bivalent and active chromatin encompassing positive or negative ageCGs, respectively. Negative ageCGs are also generally closer in genomic distance to tissue-specific CTCF binding sites. We also find an enrichment of ageCGs within lamina-associated domains (LADs) that are involved in attachment of chromatin to the inner nuclear membrane. We further validated the observed array-based age effects in the kidney by targeted capture bisulfite sequencing of select promoter regions and demonstrate a more widespread effect across multiple CpGs in these age-sensitive regions. Our data show that aging has both dynamic and common influences on DNA methylation., Our parallel analysis of age-dependent methylation in four human tissues demonstrates specific epigenetic patterns near ageCG sites identified across adult tissues. Throughout our analysis, we found that skeletal muscle was unique as this tissue showed age-dependent methylation linked with tissue-specific expressed genes and proximity to CTCF binding sites. Our results further indicate distinct landscapes of negative ageCGs that are enriched in tissue-specific methylation differences compared to positive ageCGs, which were more often shared among tissue types (Table 
5). In an analysis of 1,413 CpGs among tissues that did not include skeletal muscle, a study similar to ours also found a relationship between increasing and decreasing methylation with age and CpG context
[37]. Our analysis of DNA methylation in brain is consistent with other studies that showed enrichment of larger slope magnitude and negative correlation with age in non-CGIs, but the majority of the age-effect was increasing methylation with a relatively smaller slope magnitude typically within CGIs
[26, 38]. Other studies also found age-associated methylation changes using Methylation27 arrays within normal tissues such as dermal fibroblasts
[39], whole blood
[13, 24], CD4+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes
[13], hematopoietic progenitor cells
[7], and mesenchymal stromal and stem cells
[40, 41]. Common and tissue-specific, age-related changes were also identified in various rodent tissues
[42, 43]. Recent whole genome bisulfite sequencing comparisons of cord blood from newborns and CD4+ T cells from centenarians also demonstrated hypomethylation in non-CGIs near tissue-specific genes and hypermethylation within CGIs
[44]. A predictive model for age based on Methylation450 data from blood samples showed that this model was less predictive for other tissues, and tissue-specific predictive models each contained different CpG markers
[25]. Therefore, the mechanistic basis for both common and tissue-specific DNA methylation changes over time is unclear.Table 5
                      
                        Descriptive features and enrichments of differentially methylated sites with age across human blood, brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle tissues

The traditional role of maintenance DNA methylation activity occurs within the context of cell division as DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) detects hemimethylated DNA
[45]. DNA methylation errors with age were shown to be associated with increased methylation within mitotic cells, while non-mitotic tissue remained unchanged
[46]. In a highly mitotic tissue such as epidermis, DNMT1 was expressed in epidermal progenitors, lost during differentiation, and required for sustained repression of differentiation
[47]. DNMT1 also was required to repress CDKN2A and CDKN2B genes, two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes that may inhibit adult stem cell self-renewal
[47, 48]. CDKN2A/B are two major sites of age-dependent methylation that we observed in multiple tissues. DNMT1 depletion or Gadd45-dependent, DNA demethylation led to upregulation of differentiation-related genes such as actin, tropomyosin, and myosin heavy chain genes in skeletal muscle
[47]. Therefore, it is possible that age-related methylation changes we observe could be signatures of adult stem cell activity. In mice, maintenance of DNA methylation was required for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal
[49]. Analysis of DNA methylation within hematopoietic stem cells showed age-dependent demethylation within a subset of CpGs near myeloid-specific, differentiation-related genes
[7]. Transplanted hematopoietic stem cells from old mice also demonstrated a bias toward the myeloid lineage
[50]. In summary, maintenance of tissues by adult stem cells may be one explanation of age-dependent methylation, and will require future emphasis of investigation within sorted cell populations., Some methylation changes with age may also be signatures of minor changes in tissue composition. Inflammation and fibrotic infiltration of tissues are common features in solid tissues such as kidney and muscle with age
[51–54]. Interestingly, negative kidney ageCGs produced many GO terms affiliated with immune response and more blood-specific gene expression compared to positive ageCGs/genes linked with relatively more kidney-specific gene expression. These results may be reflective of immune cell infiltration in kidney. Muscle-specific GO terms linked to negative ageCGs could, therefore, be associated with skeletal muscle fiber type changes. Previous analyses of gene expression in muscle and kidney tissues along with histology of skeletal muscle demonstrated tissue-remodeling changes with age
[54, 55]. We have also found histological changes in skeletal muscle fibers with age in conjunction with gene expression studies from the same muscle samples used to isolate DNA for this study (manuscript in preparation). The use of nuclei enrichment methods to isolate native differentiated cell types from infiltrating cells and adult stem cells may help to more clearly define the possibility of genuine age-related methylation changes in non-mitotic cells., Age-related DNA methylation may also be explained by potential changes in chromatin structure. In addition to our study, other groups have identified enrichment of age-dependent methylation within repressive or bivalent chromatin
[24, 41]. A recent study showed DNMT1 occupancy within hypermethylated gene bodies of transcribed genes and bivalent chromatin states
[56]. It has been proposed that breakdown of chromatin boundaries at the transcriptional start and end sites may lead to aberrant spreading of methylation into promoters and reduction of gene body methylation
[56]. Therefore, it is conceivable that partitioning of positive ageCGs in bivalent or repressed chromatin, and negative ageCGs enriched in tissue-specific methylation changes in enhancer-related chromatin could be related to chromatin boundary breakdown and aberrant DNMT1 activity. CTCF is associated with boundary formation between active and repressed chromatin
[57]. Variable CTCF occupancy was also shown to be influenced by differential DNA methylation
[58]. We found very few CTCF binding sites directly covering ageCGs, but sites were generally closer to negative ageCGs near genes that were expressed, and proximity of CTCF to a Methylation27 CpG was associated with higher FPKM. Therefore, it is possible that tissue-specific, decreasing methylation changes with age could be linked to nearby CTCF binding. The enrichment of some ageCGs within LAD edges may also suggest age-related epigenetic influences on chromatin boundary structure in relation to the nuclear membrane. Some studies have shown that nuclear architecture could be altered during normal aging beyond just modifications connected with premature aging syndromes
[59]. The methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 was shown to interact with the lamin B receptor and may connect DNA methylation with nuclear architecture
[60]. Similar to our findings, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing showed that approximately 36% of identified age-associated, differentially methylated regions were within LADs
[44]. Altogether, future studies of DNMT1 binding and the influence of chromatin boundaries may provide explanations for some aspects of age-dependent methylation., While our results indicate that age-dependent methylation changes cannot be completely explained by stochastic alterations, we have not eliminated the potential role of stochastic mechanisms at work. The majority of ageCGs (except skeletal muscle) were mostly associated with genes that are not expressed within these tissues, and may suggest that these ageCG sites are subject to epigenetic drift more often within silenced or bivalent chromatin. It has been proposed that the chromatin domains surrounding these age-dependent methylated sites may contribute to epigenetic 'control' of cellular plasticity as a result of noise that could connect epigenetic changes with age to pre-neoplastic conditions
[13, 21]. We found that the majority of shared methylation changes across tissues were increasing with age in CGIs. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of newborns and centenarians also showed that decreasing methylation with age outside of CGIs (also enriched near tissue-specific genes) is more prevalent than increasing methylation
[44]. Thus, our results yielding greater numbers of positive ageCGs that were often shared among tissues may be due to emphasis of Methylation27 CpG selection within CGIs. Greater coverage of CpGs across the genome by bisulfite sequencing therefore should expose more widespread tissue-specific regions associated with aging., Our results indicate that age-dependent methylation changes cannot be completely explained by stochastic events, although positive ageCGs are enriched for common effects among tissues that could reflect stochastic processes. In contrast, sites containing negative ageCGs are enriched in tissue-specific differences in methylation, so we suspect that some aspect of age-dependent methylation is regulated. Our findings concerning DNA methylation and age in skeletal muscle and kidney are of major interest. Skeletal muscle showed the least overlap in total ageCGs with other tissues, had the strongest association of ageCGs related to tissue-specific gene expression, and generally showed a difference throughout our comparisons to blood, brain, and kidney in our analysis. Kidney tissue showed the largest number of ageCGs outside of CGIs and many negative ageCGs were shared with blood-specific genes related to immune response. Therefore, we conclude that there are multifaceted influences of aging on whole tissue DNA methylation changes."

Therefore, most genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies. Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem., To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads., Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data reduces the cost of microbial finishing to $1,000 for most genomes, and future advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.","","As the cost of sequencing has dropped, the number of sequencing projects available in the GOLD database [1] has increased 4-fold from 2,905 in 2007 to 11,472 in 2011 [2]. However, many available genomes are heavily fragmented into hundreds or thousands of contigs, and many more are sequenced at low coverage and never submitted. This is in stark contrast to the era before the 'next-generation’ revolution, when many genomes underwent expensive manual gap-closing and sequence verification (finishing) before submission [3]. As sequencing costs have dropped, finishing has become impractical given the volume of sequencing data and manual effort required [4]. Only 32% of the genomes in the GOLD database are 'complete’ or 'closed’, meaning they contain no gaps. An even fewer number were 'finished’ by manually correcting errors and adding annotation [5]. This has hampered large-scale, structural analyses of bacterial genomes, and focused research instead on isolated genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). While it remains impractical to manually finish all but the most important reference genomes, it is now possible to close microbial genomes at a reasonable cost using long-read, single-molecule sequencing and new assembly techniques [6–8]. This is expected to revitalize large-scale comparative genomic studies of whole genomes., Single-molecule sequencing is a challenging problem that has not, until recently, resulted in a commercial product. Released in 2011, the PacBio RS is the only long-read, single-molecule sequencer currently available. In contrast to competing nanopore approaches [9–11], the PacBio RS utilizes an anchored polymerase and zero-mode waveguide to observe DNA polymerization in real time [12]. This instrument debuted as a rapid method for sequencing outbreak genomes [13, 14] and has since been demonstrated on eukaryotic genomes and transcriptomes [8]. Recent studies have focused on identifying DNA modification, such as methylation patterns, directly from the single-molecule sequencing data [15]. While adoption of this technology was initially slowed by the low accuracy of the single-pass sequences, recent advancements have demonstrated that this drawback can be algorithmically managed to produce assemblies of unmatched continuity [7, 8, 16]. Steady improvements to the PacBio technology continue to increase read lengths and yield [17], while future technologies promise to combine accuracy with length using either nanopores [11] or advanced sample preparation [18]. Improved microbial genome assembly is an obvious application of these recent developments in long-read sequencing., Genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a genome from many shorter sequencing reads [19–21]. It is typically formulated as finding a traversal of a properly defined graph of reads, with the ultimate goal of reconstructing the original genome as faithfully as possible. Repeated sequence in the genome induces complexity in the graph and poses the greatest challenge to all assembly algorithms [22]. In addition, repeats are often the focus of analysis [23–25], making their correct assembly critical for subsequent studies. However, repeats can only be resolved by a spanning read or read pair that is uniquely anchored on both sides. Read pairs are typically used due to their length potential (tens of kilobase pairs), but introduce additional complexity because they cannot be precisely sized. Alternatively, long-read sequencing promises to more accurately resolve repeats and directly assemble genomes into their constituent replicons. Figure 1 shows the benefit of increasing read length when assembling Escherichia coli K12 MG1655. This genome can only be assembled into a single contig when the read length exceeds the size of the longest repeat in the genome, a multi-copy rDNA operon. The rDNA operon, sized around 5 to 7 kbp, is the largest repeat class in most bacteria and archaea [26]. Therefore, sequencing reads longer than the rDNA operon, such as those produced by single-molecule sequencing, can automatically close most microbial genomes.

                        Genome assembly graph complexity is reduced as sequence length increases. Three de Bruijn graphs for E. coli K12 are shown for k of 50, 1,000, and 5,000. The graphs are constructed from the reference and are error-free following the methodology of Kingsford et al.[27]. Non-branching paths have been collapsed, so each node can be thought of as a contig with edges indicating adjacency relationships that cannot be resolved, leaving a repeat-induced gap in the assembly. (A) At k = 50, the graph is tangled with hundreds of contigs. (B) Increasing the k-mer size to k = 1,000 significantly simplifies the graph, but unresolved repeats remain. (C) At k = 5,000, the graph is fully resolved into a single contig. The single contig is self-adjacent, reflecting the circular chromosome of the bacterium.
                    , ALLPATHS-LG was the first assembler shown to produce complete microbial genomes using single-molecule sequences [7]. Utilizing a combination of PacBio RS single-molecule reads (2 to 3 kbp), short-range Illumina read pairs (<300 bp insert), and long-range Illumina read pairs (3 to 10 kbp insert), ALLPATHS-LG assembles the Illumina reads first using a de Bruijn graph and incorporates PacBio reads afterwards to patch coverage gaps and resolve repeats. Riberio et al.[7] tested this method on 16 genomes and consensus accuracy was measured at 99.9999% on 3 genomes with an available reference. Four of the sixteen genomes were successfully assembled into a complete genome - the remaining genomes were all highly continuous but left unresolved due to large-scale repeats. These results are promising, especially in terms of consensus accuracy; however, the method requires two different sequencing platforms and three library preparations, which limits its efficiency. In addition, the jumping libraries were observed to be inconsistent at spanning large repeats due to biases in the library construction process., Ideally, complete genomes could be reconstructed from a single fragment library, minimizing costs. Previously, pair libraries were the only sequencing method capable of spanning large repeats, such as the rDNA operon, but the PacBio RS is now capable of producing single-molecule reads of the same length. Leveraging this recent development, we present an approach for microbial genome closure that relies on overlapping and assembling single-molecule reads de novo rather than patching and resolving a short-read de Brujin graph. This exploits the log-normal sequence length distribution of the PacBio RS, which produces a significant fraction of sequences greater than 7 kbp [8]. These long reads can be utilized to span the longest repeat found in most microbial genomes, while the total coverage of reads can be used to construct a high-quality consensus. We estimate that this approach could automatically close >70% of the complete bacteria and archaea in GenBank, without the need for pair libraries, using the currently available PacBio 'C2’ chemistry. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads. Finally, we show that the increased sequencing length of future technologies both decreases the coverage requirement and increases the number of genomes that can be closed using this method., Early single-molecule sequencing reads were too short and inaccurate to directly perform de novo assembly. Instead, it was shown that the reads could be corrected using a complementary technology prior to assembly [8, 14]. However, single-molecule read lengths have continued to improve, from a median length of 747 bp in 2011 to 3,122 bp in 2012 (Figure 2). Due to the increase in length, it is now possible to perform self-alignment and correction. This is because there are more detectable alignment seeds in a longer sequence versus a shorter sequence with equivalent error rate (Figure 3) [28, 29]. For example, 1.5 kbp sequences at 10% error are sufficient to reliably detect overlaps, but at 15% error, such as for XL-XL chemistry [30], 3.5 kbp sequences are required [28]. Based on this analysis, and the improving read length of the PacBio RS, we adapted the Celera Assembler PBcR pipeline [8] to support correction and assembly using only continuous long reads (CLRs). This new version uses the BLASR software [28] to detect noisy overlaps between reads; an improved version of the PBcR algorithm to process overlaps and correct the long reads; and the Celera Assembler [31] for final assembly. The pipeline is designed to be compatible with future long-read data and has been tested on reads up to 64 kbp in length. The related HGAP software provided by PacBio [32] is a derivative of our correction and assembly pipeline [8] that also performs self-correction of CLR sequences followed by assembly with Celera Assembler. However, HGAP cannot use secondary sequencing data for correction. For consistent comparison to hybrid assembly, all reported results are from the PBcR version of the pipeline.

                        Sequence length compensates for increased error. The mean number of expected 10 bp seeds (the default in BLASR) was computed for each sequence length and error rate following the method in Chaisson and Tesler [28]. Additional seeds decrease the number of matches that have to be examined, decreasing runtime and increasing accuracy. For example, increasing the number of 15 bp seeds from 10 to 20 reduces the number of sequences with over 100 matches to the human reference by 25% [28]. Points correspond to the median sequence length and observed error rate of four PacBio RS sequencing chemistries. Sequence lengths also compensate for increased error since more seeds can be found in a longer sequence. For example, 20 seeds (dashed line), can be found both in a 0.75 kbp sequence at 15% error and an approximately 2.5 kbp sequence at 30% error.
                    , To evaluate the potential of long-read data to improve microbial genome assembly, we first report the repeat complexity of all complete microbial genomes and predict the fraction that could be closed using a single PacBio sequencing library. We conclude with an analysis of six genomes sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, Roche 454, PacBio circular consensus sequencing (CCS), and PacBio CLR to evaluate performance on real data and compare PacBio CLR self-assembly versus a hybrid approach., Long, single-molecule reads are sufficient for the complete assembly of most known microbial genomes. The assemblies presented here have good likelihood and finished-grade consensus accuracy exceeding 99.9999%. By exploiting a model of the sequencing process, Quiver is able to improve assembly accuracy by QV 10, on average; and while there may be undiscovered biases in single-molecule sequencing, PacBio consensus accuracy always exceeded that of the second-generation sequencing data. In addition, assemblies of only single-molecule data consistently matched or exceeded the quality of both short-read and hybrid assemblies. Lastly, this approach requires only a single sequencing library, and reduces the time and cost of closure compared to previous approaches. However, for applications such as high-throughput SNP typing, draft Illumina sequencing is likely to remain the preferred option due to current throughput and cost advantages., For class III genomes that cannot be closed using current single-molecule sequencing, assembly continuity is significantly improved over first- and second-generation sequencing. In simulations, these most difficult genomes average only 2.89 ± 2.92 gaps with C2 sequencing, suggesting that 99% of all known microbial genomes can be assembled into fewer than 10 contigs using currently available technology. This increase in continuity greatly reduces the required cost of manual closure, which directly correlates with the number of gaps. Complementary closure techniques, such as optical mapping [51], are also enhanced by longer contigs and can be used to efficiently close even the most complex genomes., Long reads present a great opportunity, but also new challenges. For example, small replicons shorter than the typical 10 kbp library size may be inadvertently excluded from sequencing. We also noted low-abundance structural polymorphism in many of the samples analyzed. These mixed polymorphisms (for example, inversions) would have been easily overlooked in fragmented assemblies of short reads. However, to fully capture such structural dynamics requires a graph-based representation of the genome, such as FastG [52], that allows for allelic diversity. In addition, long reads present algorithmic challenges to existing assemblers. Most existing assemblers are incapable of exploiting long reads. Celera Assembler and MIRA [53] are two exceptions, but these programs were developed for reads no more than 1 kbp and become cumbersome for very long reads. New algorithms, especially for consensus generation via multiple alignment, are needed to extract the full potential from these new data., Finally, it is expected that future improvements to the PacBio chemistry, or the release of new technologies, will further extend the reach of microbial genome assembly. For example, the recent median read increase from PacBio C2 to XL chemistries (approximately 2 kbp to approximately 3 kbp) is predicted to reduce the recommended coverage requirement by two-fold. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that future chemistries with increased read lengths, and the corresponding throughput increases, will allow the full closure of most known bacteria and archaea at a cost of well under $1,000 a genome. This cost will continue to fall with future technology advances, improving reference database quality and enabling population-scale research on the structural dynamics of microbial genomes."

Local deposition and removal of DNA methylation are tightly coupled with transcription factor binding, although the relationship varies with the specific differentiation process. Conversion of monocytes to osteoclasts is a unique terminal differentiation process within the hematopoietic system. This differentiation model is relevant to autoimmune disease and cancer, and there is abundant knowledge on the sets of transcription factors involved., Here we focused on DNA methylation changes during osteoclastogenesis. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation changes took place in several thousand genes, including all relevant osteoclast differentiation and function categories. Hypomethylation occurred in association with changes in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, a proposed intermediate toward demethylation. Transcription factor binding motif analysis revealed an over-representation of PU.1, NF-κB, and AP-1 (Jun/Fos) binding motifs in genes undergoing DNA methylation changes. Among these, only PU.1 motifs were significantly enriched in both hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes; ChIP-seq data analysis confirmed its association to both gene sets. Moreover, PU.1 interacts with both DNMT3b and TET2, suggesting its participation in driving hypermethylation and hydroxymethylation-mediated hypomethylation. Consistent with this, siRNA-mediated PU.1 knockdown in primary monocytes impaired the acquisition of DNA methylation and expression changes, and reduced the association of TET2 and DNMT3b at PU.1 targets during osteoclast differentiation., The work described here identifies key changes in DNA methylation during monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation and reveals novel roles for PU.1 in this process.","","DNA methylation plays a fundamental role in differentiation as it drives and stabilizes gene activity states during cell-fate decisions. Recent reports have shown a close relationship between the participation of transcription factors during differentiation and the generation of cell type-specific epigenetic signatures [1–3]. Several mechanisms explain the co-occurrence of DNA methylation changes and transcription factor binding, including the active recruitment of enzymes involved in DNA methylation deposition, interference, or alternative use of the same genomic regions. One of the best models for investigating these mechanisms is the hematopoietic differentiation system given the profound knowledge on the transcription factors implicated at different stages. Many studies have focused on hematopoiesis in order to learn about the type, distribution, and role of epigenetic changes, particularly DNA methylation during differentiation. However, the role of DNA methylation changes and the mechanisms participating in their acquisition in terminal differentiation processes remain elusive, even though these are among the most important since they produce functional cell types with very specific roles., A singular differentiation process within the hematopoietic system is represented by differentiation from monocytes (MOs) to osteoclasts (OCs), which are giant, multinucleated cells that are specialized in degrading bone [4]. OCs differentiate from monocyte/macrophage progenitors following M-CSF [5] and RANKL [6] stimulation. Osteoclastogenesis requires cell fusion, cytoskeleton re-organization [7] and the activation of the specific gene sets necessary for bone catabolism. The signaling pathways activated after M-CSF and RANKL induction have been extensively described, and act through TRAF-6 [8, 9], immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) [10] adaptors DAP12 [11] and FcRγ [12] associated with their respective receptors, TREM-2 [13] and OSCAR, as well as calcium oscillations [14]. Signals end in the activation of NF-kB, MAPK, and c-Jun, leading to the activation of NFATc1 [15], the master transcription factor of osteoclastogenesis, together with PU.1 and MITF [16], which is already present in the progenitors. These transcription factors bind to the promoter and help upregulating OC markers such as dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP/TM7SF4) [17], tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP/ACP5) [18], cathepsin K (CTSK) [19], matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) [20], and carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2)., OC deregulation is involved in several pathological contexts, either in the form of deficient function, as in the case in osteopetrosis [21], or aberrant hyperactivation, as in osteoporosis [22]. These cells are also involved in autoimmune rheumatic disease. For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis aberrantly activated OCs are major effectors of joint destruction [23]. Moreover, OCs cause bone complications in several diseases, such as multiple myeloma [24], prostate cancer, and breast cancer [25], and there is also a specific tumor with OC origin, the giant cell tumor of bone [26]., 
                In vitro generation of OCs allows this cell type to be investigated, whereas isolating primary bone OCs for this purpose is very difficult. MOs stimulated with RANKL and M-CSF generate functional OCs [27], which degrade bone and express OC markers [28]. As indicated, the involvement of transcription factors in this model has been well studied, however very few reports have analyzed the role of epigenetic changes during osteoclastogenesis, and these focus mainly on histone modifications [29, 30]. Given the relationship between transcription factors and DNA methylation, we hypothesized that examining DNA methylation changes would provide clues about the involvement of specific factors in the dynamics and hierarchy of these changes in terminal differentiation., In this study, we compared the DNA methylation profiles of MOs and derived OCs following M-CSF and RANKL stimulation. We found that osteoclastogenesis was associated with the drastic reshaping of the DNA methylation landscape. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation occur in many relevant functional categories and key genes, including those whose functions are crucial to OC biology, like CTSK, ACP5, and DC-STAMP. Hypomethylation occurred early, concomitantly with transcription changes, was DNA replication-independent and associated with a change in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which has been proposed as an intermediate in the process of demethylation. Inspection of transcription factor binding motif over-representation in genes undergoing DNA methylation changes revealed the enrichment of the PU.1 binding motif in hypermethylated genes and AP-1, NF-kB, and also PU.1 motifs among hypomethylated genes. In fact, analysis of PU.1 ChIPseq data showed its general association to a high number of both hypo- and hypermethylated sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and immunoprecipitation experiments suggested a potential novel role for PU.1 recruiting DNMT3B to hypermethylated promoters, and TET2, which converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, to genes that become demethylated. This has been demonstrated by performing siRNA-mediated downregulation of PU.1 which partially impaired DNA methylation, expression, and recruitment of TET2 and DNMT3B to PU.1 targets, supporting the participation of PU.1 in the acquisition of DNA methylation changes at their target sites., Our results provide evidence of the participation of transcription factors, focusing on PU.1, in determining changes in DNA methylation during monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation. First, a detailed analysis of the sequences undergoing DNA methylation changes produced evidences of the participation of several transcription factors, given the specific over-representation of certain motifs in hypo- and hypermethylated genes. This initial analysis was validated in several candidate genes and using ChIPseq data for human primary monocytes [1]. Second, further analyses on one these candidate transcription factors, PU.1, and manipulation of its levels revealed a novel role for this factor in mediating DNA methylation changes during osteoclastogenesis, by direct binding of both DNMT3B and TET2., In general, DNA methylation changes in differentiation or any other dynamic process are of interest for two reasons: (1) these changes are generally associated with gene expression changes, particularly when associated with promoters or gene bodies, and reveal aspects intrinsic to identity and function of the corresponding cell types; (2) they can be considered as epigenetic footprints that, despite not necessarily being associated with an expression or organizational change, reveal a change in the milieu of a particular CpG and therefore can be used to trace the participation of specific transcription factors or other nuclear elements in that environment/neighborhood. This information can then be used to reconstruct cell signaling events, transcription factors involved and mechanisms participating in differentiation. In this sense, our data show that DNA methylation changes are involved in the differentiation dynamics and stabilization of the OC phenotype since they are concomitant with, or even precede, expression changes. These data are closely correlated with gene expression changes, and a majority of genes that undergo hypomethylation or hypermethylation at their promoters or gene bodies also experience a change in expression, although the relationship varies between different gene sets. Finally, gene ontology analysis reveals that all relevant functional categories and the majority of key genes for differentiation or the activity of functional OCs undergo DNA methylation changes and that genes within all relevant functional categories undergo DNA methylation changes., Our study suggests that both hypomethylation and hypermethylation events are equally important. Hypomethylation events, in many cases associated with gene activation, affect genes that are specific to this differentiation process or are related with the function of differentiated OCs. In contrast, the identity of genes affected by hypermethylation events is less closely correlated with OC function, given that most of them are related with gene repression. In fact, we found that hypermethylation affects genes that are specific to other cellular types. Given that osteoclastogenesis involves cell fusion and the generation of highly polyploid cells, we had speculated whether the existence of redundant copies of genetic material could lead to massive gene repression, and the silencing of extra copies. However, hypermethylation does not seem to be predominant over hypomethylation. The two activities are very specific to particular gene sets and there are no indications of changes in repetitive elements., A number of transcription factors are essential for OC formation. Some of these factors are involved in various differentiation processes. Among these, PU.1, c-Fos, NF-kB, and other factors are essential for osteoclastogenesis. In fact, NF-kB- and PU.1-deficient mice show a macrophage differentiation failure, and osteoclastogenesis is inhibited at an early stage of differentiation. c-Fos is a component of the dimeric TF AP-1, which also includes FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, and Jun proteins such as c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. Other key factors involved in OC differentiation include C/EBPα [47] and Bach1 [48]. Osteoclastogenesis also depends on the activity of more specific transcription factors like NFATc1 and MITF. Interestingly, the analysis of the presence of transcription factor binding sites in sequences that undergo DNA methylation changes shows a significant enrichment in binding motifs of transcription factors that are key in OC differentiation, some of which we have validated for a selection of putative target genes., One of the most interesting factors in this process is the ETS factor PU.1. In fact, PU.1 is the earliest molecule known to influence the differentiation and commitment of precursor myeloid cells to the OC lineage. PU.1 functions in concert with other transcription factors, including c-Myb, C/EBPα, cJun, and others, to activate osteoclast-specific genes., Our results reveal two hitherto undescribed roles for PU.1 in the context of monocyte-to-OC differentiation. First, we have identified the association of PU.1 with genes that become repressed through hypermethylation and describe its direct interaction with DNMT3b in the context of osteoclastogenesis. Second, we identify a novel interaction between PU.1 and TET2 and their association with genes that become demethylated. Our study shows that PU.1 may act as a dual adaptor during osteoclastogenesis, in the directions of hypomethylation and hypermethylation. This is compatible with previous data on genome wide DNA methylation profiling comparing cell types across the hematopietic differentiation system where an over-representation of ETS transcription factor binding sites was found [2]. In monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation, PU.1 is best known for its role in the activation of osteoclast-specific genes. However, studies in other models have previously shown that PU.1 can participate in the repression of genes in concert with elements of the epigenetic machinery. For instance, PU.1 is known to generate a repressive chromatin structure characterized by H3K9me3 in myeloid and erythroid differentiation [49]. Also, PU.1 has been shown to act in concert with MITF to recruit co-repressors to osteoclast-specific in committed myeloid precursors capable of forming either macrophages or OC [50]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that PU.1 can form a complex with DNMT3a and DNMT3b [46]. However, this is the first report where the association between PU.1 and DNMTs in association with gene repression is shown in this context., Moreover, our findings constitute the first report where the binding of PU.1 to TET2 has been described. Several recent reports have pointed at TET2-mediated hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine as an intermediate step towards demethylation [51] and our data show changes in 5hmC at genes that become demethylated in osteoclastogenesis, reinforcing the possibility that PU.1-mediated recruitment of TET2 is leading to 5hmC-mediated demethylation. However the detailed mechanisms that couple hydroxylation of 5mC and demethylation are still objects of debate., The manipulation of PU.1 levels by using siRNAs has shown that PU.1 has a direct role in recruiting DNMT3b and TET2 to its target promoters, as well as showing how impaired association of PU.1 results in defective acquisition of DNA methylation changes in both directions as well as reduced effect on gene expression changes. Therefore, our data reveal a novel role of PU.1 as a dual adaptor with the ability to bind both epigenetically repressive and epigenetically activating events and targeting DNA methylation changes in both directions (Figure 6). The incomplete impairment of DNA methylation and expression changes, as well as partial loss of Tet2 and DNMT3b following PU.1 knock-down indicates that additional transcription factors are also participating in this process. In future studies, it will also be interesting to identify the mechanisms that operate in the specific recruitment of PU.1-TET2 to genes that become demethylated, and to determine how PU.1-DNMT3b is recruited to genes that become hypermethylated. It is likely that specific transcription factors play a role, and specific post-translational modifications in PU.1 may participate in the coupling of its associated complexes to specific factors. In this context, Ser phosphorylation of PU.1 has already been shown to play a role in its recruitment to promoters [52] and could also participate in discriminating interaction with epigenetic modifiers.

                        Model showing a simplified diagram proposing the recruitment of TET2 and DNMT3b by PU.1 to its target genes that become hypo- or hypermethylated, respectively, during osteoclastogenesis. Genes that become hypomethylated exchange PU.1-DNMT3b by PU.1-TET2 (although whether pre-existing subpopulations of these associations may exist or, alternatively, post-translational or another mechanisms may mediate exchange of TET2 and DNMT3b; this is not elucidated at present). TDG is likely to mediate conversion of 5hmC/5fmC/5caC to demethylated cytosine. Hypermethylated genes experience an increase in the binding of DNMT3b as differentiation to OCs is triggered.
                    , Our study has allowed us to identify key DNA methylation changes during OC differentiation and has revealed an implication of PU.1 in the acquisition of DNA methylation and expression changes as well as identifying novel interactions with DNMT3b and TET2., Our study of the DNA methylation changes in monocyte-to-osteoclast differentiation reveals the occurrence of both hypomethylation and hypermethylation changes. These changes occur in the virtual absence of DNA replication suggesting the participation of active mechanisms, particularly relevant for hypomethylation events, for which the mechanisms are still subject of debate. Also, when comparing the dynamics of DNA methylation and expression changes, hypomethylation occurs concomitant or even earlier than expression changes. In contrast, for the majority of genes becoming hypermethylated, hypermethylation follows expression changes. Hypomethylation takes place in relevant functional categories related with OC differentiation and most of the genes that are necessary for OC function undergo hypomethylation including ACP5, CTSK, and TM7SF4 among others. The analysis of over-representation of transcription factor binding motifs reveals the enrichment of specific motifs for hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes. Among these, PU.1 and other ETS-related binding motifs are highly enriched in both hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes. We have demonstrated that PU.1 is bound to both hypo- and hypermethylated promoters and that it is able to recruit both DNMT3b and TET2. Most importantly, downregulation of PU.1 with siRNAs not only shows a reduction in the recruitment of these two enzymes to PU.1 target genes but also results in a specific reduction in the acquisition of DNA methylation and expression changes at those targets. Our results demonstrate a key role of PU.1 in driving DNA methylation changes during OC differentiation."

Experimental haplotype reconstruction based on assembling fragments of individual chromosomes is promising, but with variable yields due to incompletely understood parameter choices., We parameterize the clone-based haplotyping problem in order to provide theoretical and empirical assessments of the impact of different parameters on haplotype assembly. We confirm the intuition that long clones help link together heterozygous variants and thus improve haplotype length. Furthermore, given the length of the clones, we address how to choose the other parameters, including number of pools, clone coverage and sequencing coverage, so as to maximize haplotype length. We model the problem theoretically and show empirically the benefits of using larger clones with moderate number of pools and sequencing coverage. In particular, using 140 kb BAC clones, we construct haplotypes for a personal genome and assemble haplotypes with N50 values greater than 2.6 Mb. These assembled haplotypes are longer and at least as accurate as haplotypes of existing clone-based strategies, whether in vivo or in vitro., Our results provide practical guidelines for the development and design of clone-based methods to achieve long range, high-resolution and accurate haplotypes.","","Current whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies can provide genotype information of the human genome with very limited haplotype information. Understanding the human genome on the haploid level is important in the development of personalized medicine, as haplotypes can help elucidate genetic variants associated with gene expression, long-range interaction, and susceptibility of humans to disease [1]. Many computational and experimental approaches have been developed to reconstruct phase information for diploid genomes, and each has its strengths and limitations. For example, population-based methods are commonly used to infer the haplotypes based on genotypes of a population, but have limited success in phasing rare or individual-specific variants [2–5]. Sequencing technologies allow us to 'assemble’ haplotypes by chaining together variants that appear on the same read; however, the length of the haplotype is largely dependent on read length and sequence coverage [6], making it challenging to phase with shorter read information. Haplotype contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads are typically orders of magnitude shorter than genomic contigs, owing to the sparse distribution of heterozygous variants required for haplotype assembly. Direct resolution of allelic haplotypes can be achieved by physical separation of individual chromosomes using microfluidic devices or microdissection, but amplification bias of the isolated chromosomes leads to low resolution [7–9]., Another widely used approach is clone-based haplotyping, first introduced by Burgtorf et al. [10]. The basic principle behind this method involves constructing clone libraries that will extract long subsections of a haploid and pooling together several clones for sequencing. As long as the clones within a pool do not overlap, the clones can be computationally reconstructed from shorter sequencing reads and assembled into longer haploid sequences. Alternative implementations of the clone-based haplotyping method [11–13] mainly differ in how clones are generated (affecting the length of the clones) and the number of pools sequenced. For example, in a study by Suk et al., fosmid clones with an average length of 40 kbp were combined into 288 pools, with 5,000 clones per pool [12], and the N50 length of the assembled haplotypes was 1 Mbp. Several conceptually similar haplotyping methods have recently been reported, which fragment genomic DNA in vitro and then pool together the fragments for sequencing. From example, the long fragment read (LFR) method was used in one study [13] to generate haploid fragments of length (L) 10 to 300 kbp, which were combined into 384 pools with around 5,000 to 10,000 fragments per pool. The resulting N50 length of the assembled haplotypes ranged from 400 kbp to 1 Mbp. Another method generated haploid fragments of average length (L) = 13.8 kb, leading to haplotypes with comparable N50 values [14]. Most recently, research using Moleculo technology (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) reported fragments with L = 6 to 8 kb [15], possibly reaching up to 10 kb., The differences in the experimental designs of these studies directly affect the cost versus haplotype length trade-off. Previous clone-based haplotyping experiments did not explicitly consider how their parameter choices affect the cost versus haplotype length trade-off, and often used the same design criteria as those used for sequence assembly. Note that there is a major difference between sequence assembly and haplotype assembly; sequence assembly relies on partially overlapping short sequences of typically 20 to 70 bp in length, whereas haplotype assembly depends on multiple adjacent heterozygous variants at a typical spacing of 1.5 kb, which is a much more stringent requirement., Here, we pursue a parameterized approach to haplotype assembly. We considered the following parameters: clone length (L); number of clones per pool (n); number of pools (p); and sequence read coverage per pool (r). The use of parameters allowed us to compare the different methods (Table 1) and understand the effects of haplotype length on different parameters. Please note that we use the term 'clone’ in this paper because we were designing explicitly for clone-based haplotyping; however, a 'clone’ can refer more generally to any type of haploid subsequence of the genome, regardless of how it was obtained (that is, in vitro or in vivo).Table 1

                  , We started with the assumption that once the clone library is prepared, the cost is simply a function of the number of pools (p). However, our calculations are useful for understanding other trade-offs as well. Although intuitively, larger clone size (L) leads to longer haplotype length, the assembled haplotype length depends upon the combination of parameters L, n, p, and r in a non-trivial fashion. Connecting overlapping haploid clones generates long haplotypes. As mentioned above, haplotype assembly is unlike sequence assembly, where L only needs to be long enough to span the longest repetitive sequence. For haplotype assembly, the clones must be long enough to span adjacent heterozygous variants. Therefore, the first step in a good design is to make L as large as possible within the constraints of available technology and cost. Next, to maximize the chance of getting overlapping clones, the total clone coverage (
                    )should be maximized. At the same time, overlapping clones within a pool may lead to heterozygous calls that are not informative for haplotyping, implying that clone coverage within a pool (
                    ) should be kept low. The naive way to accomplish these design objectives is to keep n low and p high, which in turn, increases the cost of the experiment., We studied the p versus length trade-off by simulating clones under different experimental parameters, and assembling haplotypes assuming a known distribution of variants. To experimentally validate the effect of using larger clone size (L), we performed an experiment with p = 24 pooled bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from a Caucasian male sample, NA20431, of the Personal Genome Project (designated PGP1). BAC clones are longer (L = 100 to 300 kbp [17]) than fosmid-based clones (L = 40 kbp) and LFRs (L = 60 kbp). To keep sequencing costs low, we used additional reads from single low-pass WGS in addition to modest coverage in each pool. Even with low sequencing cost (p and sequence coverage), we identified the assembly of accurate haplotypes that were more than 2.5 times longer than previously reported ones. Our results also suggest important design principles for clone-based haplotype assembly: for long haplotyping, L should be as high as possible within the bounds of technology; it is possible to achieve long haplotypes with a much smaller p (and hence lower experimental cost) than was implemented in the previous efforts; and, there is a direct trade-off between depth of sequencing per pool (r), and the length and resolution of haplotypes (fraction of variants phased), but modest sequencing depth is sufficient., In addition to length, we also took into account the accuracy of the generated haplotypes. The two types of errors that can arise in haplotyping are mismatches and switches. Mismatches are defined as single nucleotide differences between the assembled haplotype and the true haplotype, and are probably caused by erroneous base calls. Switch errors are defined as positions where a crossover in haplotype orientation is needed to recover the true phase. To test the accuracy of the haplotypes, we need to compare the generated haplotypes with the true haplotypes (that is, haplotypes from trio data). However, the true haplotypes are not always known, and without knowledge of the ground truth, the best we could do is compare with haplotypes obtained via other methods., In our parameterized analysis of clone-based haplotyping methods, the current bottleneck for achieving long haplotypes was the clone lengths (L). Because of the distribution of variants, adjacent variants that are longer than L can never be spanned, and thus the haplotype lengths saturate when all variants within a distance greater than or equal to L from each other are connected., The importance of L is illustrated in Figure 1a, which shows a power law relationship between haplotype length and L. Furthermore, it illustrates the current gap between in vitro technologies for isolating DNA and clone-based methods. As shown, when L = 10 kb (current limit on reported length of Illumina’s Moleculo technology [15]), the maximum achievable haplotype length is 188 kb. Meanwhile, clone technologies have the potential to achieve significantly longer haplotypes with N50 lengths of 1.12 Mb (L = 40 kb, Fosmid clones) to 22.8 Mb (L = 140 kb, BAC clones). The importance of L is not just limited to clone-based and dilution-based methods; haplotyping using sequence reads can be modeled using our framework by setting L as the read length, n = 1, and p as the number of reads sequenced. For example, long reads were used to assemble haplotypes was on the HuRef genome [23]. The HuRef genome used a more complex paired-end Sanger sequencing (7.5x coverage) protocol with mixed insert sizes (L) and achieved haplotype lengths of N50 = 350 kb. More recent methods [24] use a single molecule approach to achieve long reads. The importance of L is further illustrated in Figure 1b, as other clone-based methods are well into the saturation levels of their corresponding expected contig-length curve. We concluded that it was more effective to increase L and use a moderate p. In our experiment (L = 140 kb, p = 24), we achieved haplotypes that had comparable accuracy to leading clone-based methods, and were more than twice as long, with an N50 length of 2.6 Mbp and the longest haplotype spanning over 14 Mbp. By contrast, the LFR haplotypes, derived from shorter clones (L (N50) = 60 kb) and more pools (p = 384), had an N50 length of 411 kb for the same individual [13]., By reducing p, the total cost of sequencing and clone library construction was reduced, but clone coverage was also decreased. Although we were able to compensate for the small clone coverage in terms of haplotype length by using larger L, our lower coverage recovered fewer variants compared with WGS experiments from other individuals of European descent (see Additional file 1: Table S1). This low clone coverage also decreased the probability of recovering a heterozygous variant (P
                v
                ) and may explain the higher homozygous to heterozygous ratio for BAC pool data (see Additional file 1: Table S1). However, the variants could be augmented by acquiring WGS data from the same individual., The final parameter affecting haplotype resolution and thus length is f, the fraction of variants recovered per clone, which is affected by many other factors such as read coverage per pool (r), amplification bias, and the filtering protocol for reads and variants. The discrepancy between simulated and actual haplotypes lengths in Figure 1b may be due to different values of f (see Additional file 1: Figures S3 and S4). For example, it is not surprising that the most discrepant results are from the LFR experiment, which used low values of sequencing coverage (r < 2x, in contrast with our protocol where r = 6x), causing a smaller value of f, which in turn decreases haplotype lengths., To test accuracy, we performed a three-way comparison between the BAC, LFR, and population-based haplotypes (Figure 3). The high concordance between the BAC and LFR haplotypes suggests that both methods have similar accuracy. The higher MES between the clone-based and population-based haplotypes could be due to a variety of factors, including limited population sample size and limited burn-in iterations run by the algorithm due to limited computational resources. Furthermore, population-based haplotypes have difficulty phasing rare, individual-based, and somatic variants. Upon further examination of the population-based haplotypes, we found that the positions of the switch errors correlated with positions where the BEAGLE algorithm had difficulties deciding which phase assignment to choose. The biological implications of these regions have not yet been studied and could possibly represent undiscovered recombination hot spots, or simply areas where the population data are weak. In summary, clone-based haplotypes can be used to provide accurate, megabase-long haplotypes., Through the integration of statistical modeling and experimental validation, we found that long-range connectivity encoded in large clones or DNA fragments is crucial for constructing long haplotypes. We also provide a practical guideline on the parameter choices and expected haplotype sizes for further design and development of haplotyping methods."

                  Candida albicans is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungal pathogen that afflicts immunocompromised human hosts. With rare and transient exceptions the yeast is diploid, yet despite its clinical relevance the respective sequences of its two homologous chromosomes have not been completely resolved., We construct a phased diploid genome assembly by deep sequencing a standard laboratory wild-type strain and a panel of strains homozygous for particular chromosomes. The assembly has 700-fold coverage on average, allowing extensive revision and expansion of the number of known SNPs and indels. This phased genome significantly enhances the sensitivity and specificity of allele-specific expression measurements by enabling pooling and cross-validation of signal across multiple polymorphic sites. Additionally, the diploid assembly reveals pervasive and unexpected patterns in allelic differences between homologous chromosomes. Firstly, we see striking clustering of indels, concentrated primarily in the repeat sequences in promoters. Secondly, both indels and their repeat-sequence substrate are enriched near replication origins. Finally, we reveal an intimate link between repeat sequences and indels, which argues that repeat length is under selective pressure for most eukaryotes. This connection is described by a concise one-parameter model that explains repeat-sequence abundance in C. albicans as a function of the indel rate, and provides a general framework to interpret repeat abundance in species ranging from bacteria to humans., The phased genome assembly and insights into repeat plasticity will be valuable for better understanding allele-specific phenomena and genome evolution.","Haplotype, Phasing, Indel, Microsatellite, Homopolymer, Repeat","The advent of short-read DNA sequencing has resulted in super-exponential growth in the quantity of available sequencing data. Along with a dramatic increase in the number of assembled reference genomes for different species, much recent effort has been focused on defining the sequence variants - such as SNPs and insertions/deletions (‘indels’) - between individuals of the same species. The focus of many such studies is the resolution of haplotypes [1], which specify which variant bases are inherited together on contiguous DNA. Despite this interest in determining the phasing of polymorphisms, short read lengths complicate the resolution of haplotypes: adjacent polymorphisms must be sequenced in the same molecule to be included in the same haplotype. Several elegant approaches can overcome this difficulty, including the coupling of pedigree analysis with sequencing data [2, 3] and, more recently, various methods of spatially partitioning whole homologous chromosomes - via microdissection [4], microfluidic device [5], or dilution [6–10] - such that they can be separately barcoded, amplified, and sequenced before assembly into barcode-defined haplotypes., Most of the effort in haplotype discovery has focused on humans; thus, there are few phased genomes available in other multiploid model organisms. Knowing the phasing information in model organisms, however - for example, those that are single-celled, have compact genomes, double rapidly, and are easily manipulated genetically - is useful for a variety of reasons, including ease of measurement of allele-specific phenomena in different genetic backgrounds and observation of homolog-specific evolution on laboratory timescales. Candida albicans is a model fungal pathogen that almost exclusively exists in a diploid state and does not achieve genome diversity via a typical meiotic cycle with frequent recombination. Instead, it employs one of two strategies, both involving mating and whole chromosome loss, where the order of these events is inverted. First, in the so-called ‘parasexual cycle’ [11], two diploids of opposite mating type can mate to yield a tetraploid, and then return to the diploid state via chromosome loss, a process that can occasionally result in homozygosis of single chromosomes [12, 13]. Alternatively, a recent report revealed that chromosome loss can occur first to generate a mating-competent haploid, which can subsequently mate to restore the diploid state [14]. Importantly, both mating options occur rarely in C. albicans, and both leave the homologs largely intact. Thus, the phasing of polymorphisms in C. albicans has fewer entropic, degenerating forces than in most other organisms, making the assembly of its phased genome particularly desirable., Extensive sequencing of C. albicans and many closely related Candida species has yielded important insight into the pathogenicity of C. albicans[15], as well as a host of valuable whole-genome assemblies. The first official release of the C. albicans genome, Assembly 19, was partially diploid and identified thousands of polymorphisms using low-coverage Sanger sequencing, but had long haploid spans and did not assemble the genome into full chromosomes [16]. The next major release, Assembly 21 [17], assembled contigs into whole chromosomes but was a reftig-based assembly, that is, the alleles present within a given chromosome were equally likely to have originated from one of the two haplotypes (Figure 1A). The first attempt at phasing the genome involved using microarrays to probe 38,000 SNPs identified in the low-coverage assemblies [18]. Here we advance the genome-phasing effort by using next-generation sequencing. Our nearly 100-fold improvement in coverage relative to prior assemblies nearly doubles the number of high-confidence SNPs and indels that could be assigned to their respective homologs. This increase in phasing resolution within our diploid genome assembly permits more sensitive analysis of allele-specific phenomena and provides insight into genome architecture and evolution.

Additional strains to sequence were selected to be homozygous for the indicated chromosomes.

                    , Here we report the assembly of a completely phased diploid genome sequence for the standard C. albicans laboratory reference strain. We extensively revised the number of SNPs from prior assemblies [16, 17], in total phasing 65,787 SNPs resulting in a nearly two-fold improvement in haplotype resolution over array-based efforts [18]. This increase in phasing resolution facilitates the detection of allele-specific phenomena by allowing comparison of allele-specific reads across multiple SNPs and subsequent pooling of the signal. Finally, we additionally identified and phased 6,103 short indels, finding that their distribution throughout the genome is significantly non-uniform., A fully phased diploid genome for a unicellular model organism like C. albicans has the potential to greatly advance our ability to identify sequence determinants underlying various cellular phenomena involving nucleic acids (for example, nucleosome positioning, expression levels, secondary structure, and so on). Such determinants can be elucidated because measuring differences between thousands of allelic pairs provides a broad scope of sequence variants while simultaneously facilitating the attribution of expression differences to particular sequence features. In other words, since each allelic pair has only a few polymorphisms, phenomenological deviations between alleles can be more easily attributed to specific sequence features than is possible when comparing totally different genes. Due to the technical difficulties associated with mapping haplotypes, allele-specific measurements have predominantly relied on inbred strains or unnatural hybrid diploid organisms, where viable haploids could be sequenced prior to hybrid construction such that the respective haplotypes were known [22, 31–33]. Since C. albicans is a natural organism that is almost exclusively diploid and frequently heterozygous, its alleles may have evolved complex and physiologically relevant interactions that would not have developed in a multi-species hybrid or highly inbred population., We found that indels are spatially clustered throughout the genome, with nearly 93% of indels in multikilobase spans that collectively comprise only 45% of the genome. In that both indel-dense and indel-sparse regions contain a similar level of coding sequence, it seems unlikely that the disparity in indels arises from gross differences in sequence context (for example, coding sequences versus telomeres). We speculate that these spans could result from regions undergoing loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events, which are frequently observed in C. albicans; however, such events typically involve whole chromosomes (or, at the very least, large chromosomal regions), and it thus remains unclear whether there is an alternative LOH mechanism that occurs on a shorter length scale that can effectively erase indels through homozygosis., The subtle increase in indel and repeat-sequence density that we observe near replication origins poses an interesting conundrum. In particular, it is not actually clear whether indels are favored near replication origins over an evolutionary timescale. At first, it seems that there are simply more indels near origins because there are also more repeats, arguing that indels have no higher propensity to occur near origins than elsewhere. However, since indels may be the driving force behind the creation of repeats in the first place - a possibility reinforced by our one-parameter model - indels may indeed be more likely near origins. For instance, one could imagine that a DNA polymerase prone to introducing indels is not as processive as ordinary polymerases, thus leading to an indel bias (and potentially a repeat bias) near origins. Ultimately, it is nontrivial to resolve this problem since the LOH events that occur in C. albicans erase indels but preserve repeats., Due to their role in positioning nucleosomes and relevance to human disease, long repeats in eukaryotic genomes have been the topic of many experimental and quantitative modeling studies [26, 29, 34–36]. Here we find that a very simple model based on the indel rate for single repeat units can predict the abundance of repeats across the C. albicans genome. Though we cannot exclude the possibility that this correspondence is purely coincidental, it seems unlikely that one of the few mechanisms that locally alters the length of DNA (that is, indels) is not involved in the generation of DNA sequences whose length is the chief determinant of their function (that is, repeats). A causative relationship is further supported by the correlation between sharp increases in the indel rate and marked increases in repeat abundance for both homopolymers and dyad repeats., Interestingly, repeat abundance in nearly all eukaryotes we investigated (including C. albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that the net effect of indels is to lengthen repeats (that is, the indel-rate multiplier α is positive) (Figure 6F). The simplest explanation of this observation is that insertions occur more frequently than deletions. However, at least in S. cerevisiae, where the balance between insertions and deletions has been explored directly [28, 29, 37], deletions far outnumber insertions over laboratory timescales. It is likely that the difference in timescales explains this paradox: the observed evolutionary bias is a convolution of both mechanistic forces in the short term and selective biases in the long term; thus, while deletions may occur more frequently than insertions, selection could favor insertions, leading to their preferential fixation over time. It is also possible that the selective force stems largely from nucleosome positioning, since the prokaryotes we explored lack both nucleosomes and, critically, an overabundance of long repeats (Figure 6F). In fact, the Escherichia coli and Synechococcus elongatus genomes have far fewer long repeats than expected by chance (that is, they have negative α values; Figure 6F), consistent with a mechanistic bias toward deletions that is not countered by an opposing selective bias toward insertions. Further insight into the molecular determinants of the sign and magnitude of α may be gained by analyzing Candida guilliermondii, which is the only organism we found with α near zero. Since the Candida species other than C. albicans in Figure 6F were all sequenced by the same institute [15], we do not expect that the observation of α ~ 0 for C. guilliermondii is an artifact of the sequencing platform. The next two nearest neighbors in the Candida phylogeny - Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida lusitaniae - may be additionally informative, as they have progressively higher α values, with α in D. hansenii slightly below the range of α values in other eukaryotes and α in C. lusitaniae within the range., We have shown that the fully phased C. albicans genome reveals phenomena that are both expected, such as allele-specific expression, and unexpected, such as indel clustering. We anticipate that the higher degree of genomic resolution provided here will empower not only future researchers of this important model organism, but also those who study allele-specific traits and expression characteristics more generally."

We call these lines Modifiers of murine metastable epialleles (Mommes)., We report a basic molecular and phenotypic characterization for twenty of the Momme mouse lines, and in each case we also identify the causative mutation. Three of the lines carry a mutation in a novel epigenetic modifier, Rearranged L-myc fusion (Rlf), and one gene, Rap-interacting factor 1 (Rif1), has not previously been reported to be involved in transcriptional regulation in mammals. Many of the other lines are novel alleles of known epigenetic regulators. For two genes, Rlf and Widely-interspaced zinc finger (Wiz), we describe the first mouse mutants. All of the Momme mutants show some degree of homozygous embryonic lethality, emphasizing the importance of epigenetic processes. The penetrance of lethality is incomplete in a number of cases. Similarly, abnormalities in phenotype seen in the heterozygous individuals of some lines occur with incomplete penetrance., Recent advances in sequencing enhance the power of sensitized mutagenesis screens to identify the function of previously uncharacterized factors and to discover additional functions for previously characterized proteins. The observation of incomplete penetrance of phenotypes in these inbred mutant mice, at various stages of development, is of interest. Overall, the Momme collection of mouse mutants provides a valuable resource for researchers across many disciplines.","","Mutagenesis screens for modifiers of position effect variegation in Drosophila have played a defining role in the development of the field of epigenetics [1]. The screens used a fly strain that showed variegated expression of the white (w) locus, resulting in red and white patches in the eye, as a result of the stochastic establishment of epigenetic state. The genes identified by these screens turn out to have pivotal roles in gene silencing [2–4]. We have designed a similar screen in the mouse, using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene that shows variegated expression in red blood cells. Offspring of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated males are screened for changes in the percentage of erythrocytes expressing GFP; this is a screen for dominant effects. Each mutant line is named a Modifier of murine metastable epiallele Dominant, MommeD[5]. The underlying mutations have been identified and published for nine lines and the mutations occur in DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b), chromatin remodelers (Smarca5 and Baz1b), a histone deacetylase (Hdac1), a transcriptional co-repressor (Trim28), a eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF3h) [6–10] and a previously unknown gene, Smchd1, now shown to be required for X-inactivation in the mouse [11, 12]. Recently, Smchd1 has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor [13] and mutations in SMCHD1 have been shown to be tightly associated with the human disease facioscapulohumeral dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) [14]., Our results suggest that transgene silencing in the mouse acts through a mechanism common to transposon silencing, X-inactivation and imprinting. We provide evidence that a novel gene, Rlf, is involved in this process. Depletion of Rlf leads to DNA hypermethylation at the transgene. How this is achieved is currently unknown and requires further investigation. We have isolated the first mouse mutants for Rlf and Wiz and shown that the genes are required for normal embryonic development. Notably, the human homologs of many of the genes recovered from our screen have been found to be associated with human diseases, in some cases identified in family studies and in other cases suggested by genome-wide association studies (Table 1)., Since the mouse is often used as a disease model, we anticipate that our collection of Momme mutants will provide a valuable resource for researchers across many disciplines."

We describe a comprehensive evaluation of common methods using the SEQC benchmark dataset and ENCODE data. We consider a number of key features, including normalization, accuracy of differential expression detection and differential expression analysis when one condition has no detectable expression. We find significant differences among the methods, but note that array-based methods adapted to RNA-seq data perform comparably to methods designed for RNA-seq. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of replicate samples significantly improves detection power over increased sequencing depth., High-throughput sequencing technology is rapidly becoming the standard method for measuring RNA expression levels (aka RNA-seq) [1]. The advent of rapid sequencing technologies along with reduced costs has enabled detailed profiling of gene expression levels, impacting almost every field in life sciences and is now being adopted for clinical use [2]. RNA-seq technology enables the detailed identification of gene isoforms, translocation events, nucleotide variations and post-transcriptional base modifications [3]. One of the main goals of these experiments is to identify the differentially expressed genes in two or more conditions. Such genes are selected based on a combination of expression change threshold and score cutoff, which are usually based on P values generated by statistical modeling., The expression level of each RNA unit is measured by the number of sequenced fragments that map to the transcript, which is expected to correlate directly with its abundance level. This measure is fundamentally different from gene probe-based methods, such as microarrays. In RNA-seq the expression signal of a transcript is limited by the sequencing depth and is dependent on the expression levels of other transcripts, whereas in array-based methods probe intensities are independent of each other. This, as well as other technical differences, has motivated the development of a growing number of statistical algorithms that implement a variety of approaches for normalization and differential expression (DE) detection. Typical approaches use Poisson or negative binomial distributions to model the gene count data and a variety of normalization procedures (see [4] for a review)., In this comparison study, we evaluated a few of the most commonly used and freely available differential expression software packages: Cuffdiff [5], edgeR [6], DESeq [7], PoissonSeq [8], baySeq [9], and limma [10] adapted for RNA-seq use. We used two benchmark datasets: the first is the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) dataset, which includes replicated samples of the human whole body reference RNA and human brain reference RNA along with RNA spike-in controls. These samples are part of the MAQC study for benchmarking microarray technology [11, 12] as well as the SEQC effort to characterize RNA-seq technology and include close to 1,000 genes that were validated by TaqMan qPCR. The second dataset is RNA-seq data from biological replicates of three cell lines that were characterized as part of the ENCODE project [13]. Our analysis focused on a number of measures that are most relevant for detection of differential gene expression from RNA-seq data: i) normalization of count data; ii) sensitivity and specificity of DE detection; iii) performance on the subset of genes that are expressed in one condition but have no detectable expression in the other condition and, finally, iv) the effects of reduced sequencing depth and number of replicates on the detection of differential expression. Importantly, this evaluation does not address the related and important problem of detecting differential isoform expression and identification of novel transcripts. Rather, the evaluation is restricted to the specific case of detecting DE based on unified gene models., Our results demonstrate substantial differences among the methods both in terms of specificity and sensitivity for the detection of differentially expressed genes. In most benchmarks Cuffdiff performed less favorably with a higher number of false positives without any increase in sensitivity. Our results conclusively demonstrate that the addition of replicate samples provides substantially greater detection power of DE than increased sequence depth. Hence, including more replicate samples in RNA-seq experiments is always to be preferred over increasing the number of sequenced reads., In this study we performed a detailed comparative analysis of a number of methods for differential expression analysis from RNA-seq data. For the various methods, our comparison focused on the performance of the normalization, control of false positives, effect of sequencing depth and replication, and on the subset of gene expressed exclusively in one condition. In contrast to other approaches, which rely on simulated data generated by specific statistical distribution or limited experimental datasets [23, 33, 34], we used the SEQC experimental dataset where a large fraction of the differentially expressed genes were validated by qRT-PCR and biological replicates from three cell lines profiled by the ENCODE project [13]. Overall, no single method emerged as favorable in all comparisons but it is apparent that methods based on negative binomial modeling (DESeq, edgeR, and baySeq) have improved specificity and sensitivities as well as good control of false positive errors with comparable performance. However, methods based on other distributions, such as PoissonSeq and limma, compared favorably and have improved modeling of genes expressed in one condition. On the other hand, Cuffdiff has reduced sensitivity and specificity as measured by ROC analysis as well as the significant number of false positives in the null model test. We postulate that this is related to its normalization procedure, which attempts to account for both alternative isoform expression and length of transcripts. Table 2 summarizes the comparison results in addition to a number of additional quality measures, which were not directly evaluated in this study.Table 2

                  , Surprisingly, the limma package, which was developed and optimized for expression array analysis, had comparable, and by some measures improved, performance for both normalization versions tested relative to the other models, which were tailored for RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, the difference between quantile normalization or the RNA-seq specific voom function in limma was evident in the number of false DE genes in the null model and in the sensitivity to the sequencing depth and number of replicated samples. limma models the data as a normal distribution, which is a reasonable assumption for array intensities but perhaps counterintuitive for count data since it models discrete data with a continuous distribution. However, it is plausible that in the limit of large counts it is more important to model the variance accurately than the discreteness. This study demonstrates that for datasets with a large number of genes (or tags), the limma package is well suited for detecting DE genes and that modeling gene count data as a log normal distribution, with the appropriate pseudo counts, is a reasonable approximation., The results from sequencing depth and replication analysis demonstrate conclusively that the number of sample replicates is the most significant factor in accurate identification of DE genes [33]. This is not surprising considering that the focus of most methods is to model the variability in gene expression measurements and therefore increasing the number of replicates adds power to this estimate. Since the squared signal-to-noise improves with increased mean expression [35], DE among the highly expressed genes is easily detected even with low sequencing depth and few sample replicates. From a practical point of view, studies focused on detecting DE among lowly expressed genes will benefit significantly from an increased number of replicates. Many additional factors that directly impact the detection of differential expression were not considered in this study such as choice of alignment algorithm, derivation of gene counts, multi-factored studies, detection of alternative transcripts and choice of sequencing platform. Cuffdiff, for example, incorporates differential isoform detection, which is not supported by the simple gene counting methods evaluated here. It is also important to note that the evaluated methods may not be applicable to all types of RNA-seq data. For example, small RNA sequencing is not always amenable to quantile normalization as performed in this study (data not shown). Similarly, RNA-seq data from cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) or RIP-seq from RNA-binding proteins are fundamentally different in nature from typical transcriptome profiling and therefore require specialized models. Finally, the field of high-throughput sequencing is rapidly evolving with new technologies being continuously introduced. These add additional elements of variability to the measurements and will require specific consideration [36]., The emergence of RNA-seq as the method of choice for transcriptional profiling has motivated the development of a growing number of algorithms for normalization and analysis. This comparative study is the first exhaustive comparison of the widely used DE methods on experimental data. It provides important guidelines for evaluating RNA-seq analysis methods and points the direction for future improvements."
"54","Insights into snoRNA biogenesis and processing from PAR-CLIP of snoRNA core proteins and small RNA sequencing","Shivendra Kishore, Andreas R Gruber, Dominik J Jedlinski, Afzal P Syed, Hadi Jorjani, Mihaela Zavolan","Computational and Systems Biology, Biozentrum, University of Basel","Shivendra Kishore, Andreas R Gruber, Mihaela Zavolan","shivendra.kishore@unibas.ch, agruber@tbi.univie.ac.at, mihaela.zavolan@unibas.ch","9 September 2013","In recent years, a variety of small RNAs derived from other RNAs with well-known functions such as tRNAs and snoRNAs, have been identified. The functional relevance of these RNAs is largely unknown. To gain insight into the complexity of snoRNA processing and the functional relevance of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, we sequence long and short RNAs, small RNAs that co-precipitate with the Argonaute 2 protein and RNA fragments obtained in photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins., Analysis of these data sets reveals that many loci in the human genome reproducibly give rise to C/D box-like snoRNAs, whose expression and evolutionary conservation are typically less pronounced relative to the snoRNAs that are currently cataloged. We further find that virtually all C/D box snoRNAs are specifically processed inside the regions of terminal complementarity, retaining in the mature form only 4-5 nucleotides upstream of the C box and 2-5 nucleotides downstream of the D box. Sequencing of the total and Argonaute 2-associated populations of small RNAs reveals that despite their cellular abundance, C/D box-derived small RNAs are not efficiently incorporated into the Ago2 protein., We conclude that the human genome encodes a large number of snoRNAs that are processed along the canonical pathway and expressed at relatively low levels. Generation of snoRNA-derived processing products with alternative, particularly miRNA-like, functions appears to be uncommon.","","Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are a specific class of small non-protein coding RNAs that are best known for their function as guides of modifications (2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation) of other non-protein coding RNAs such as ribosomal, small nuclear and transfer RNAs (rRNAs, snRNAs and tRNAs, respectively) [1–3]. Based on sequence and structural features, snoRNAs are divided into two classes. C/D box snoRNAs share the consensus C (RUGAUGA, R = A or G) and D (CUGA) box motifs, which are brought into close proximity by short regions of complementarity between the snoRNA 5' and 3' ends [4, 5] and are bound by the four core proteins of the small ribonucleoprotein complex (snoRNP), namely 15.5K, NOP56, NOP58 and Fibrillarin (FBL) [6–8] during snoRNA maturation. Fibrillarin is the methyltransferase that catalyzes the 2'-O-methylation of the ribose in target RNAs [9]. Most C/D box snoRNAs also contain additional conserved C' and D' motifs located in the central region of the snoRNA. The other class of snoRNAs is defined by a double-hairpin structure with two single-stranded H (ANANNA, N = A, C, G or U) and ACA box domains [10], and are therefore called H/ACA box snoRNAs. They associate with four conserved proteins, Dyskerin (DKC1), Nhp2, Nop10 and Gar1, to form snoRNPs that are functionally active in pseudouridylation. Although all four H/ACA proteins are necessary for efficient pseudouridylation [10], it is Dyskerin that provides the pseudouridine synthase activity [11]. While H/ACA and C/D box snoRNAs accumulate in the nucleolus, some snoRNAs reside in the nucleoplasmic Cajal bodies (CBs) where they guide modifications of snRNAs [2] and are called small Cajal body-specific RNAs (scaRNAs). In addition to the typical H/ACA snoRNA features, vertebrate H/ACA box scaRNAs carry a CB localization signal called CAB box (UGAG) in the loop of their 5' and/or 3' hairpins [12]., Immediately upstream of the D box and/or the D' box, C/D box snoRNAs contain 10 to 21 nucleotide-long antisense elements that are complementary to sites in their target RNAs [13–15]. The nucleotide in the target RNA that is complementary to the fifth nucleotide upstream from the D/D' box of the snoRNA is targeted for 2'-O-methylation by the snoRNP [14, 15]. H/ACA box snoRNAs contain two antisense elements termed pseudouridylation pockets, located in the 5' and 3' hairpin domains of the snoRNA [16, 17]. Substrate uridines are selected through base-pairing interactions between the pseudouridylation pocket and target RNA sequences that flank the targeted uridine., Deep-sequencing studies revealed a surprising diversity of small RNAs derived from non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) known as small derived RNAs (sdRNAs) with well-established functions such as tRNAs [18, 19], Y RNAs [20], vault RNAs [21], ribosomal RNAs [22], spliceosomal RNAs [23] and snoRNAs [24–26]. In fact, the profile of sequenced reads observed for some of these small RNA species are very characteristic and have even been used for ncRNA gene finding based on sequencing data [27, 28]. The majority of C/D box and H/ACA snoRNAs seems to be extensively processed, producing stable small RNAs from the termini of the mature snoRNA [29] and the processing pattern is conserved across cell types [30]. Thus, it appears that snoRNAs are versatile molecules that give rise to snoRNA-derived miRNAs [24, 31], other small RNAs [25, 29] or longer processing fragments [32]., To gain insight into the complexity of snoRNA processing and the functional relevance of the derived sdRNAs, we undertook a comprehensive characterization of products generated from snoRNA loci, combining high-throughput sequencing of long and short RNA fragments with photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins and with data from Argonaute 2 (Ago2) immunoprecipitation sequencing (IP-seq) experiments. We found that many loci in the human genome can give rise to C/D box-like snoRNAs. Among the novel snoRNAs that we identified are very short sequences, extending little beyond the C and D boxes, which are essential for the binding of core snoRNA proteins. Compared to the snoRNAs that are already known, the novel snoRNA candidates exhibit a lower level of evolutionary conservation and a lower expression level. These findings indicate that the C/D box snoRNA structure evolves relatively easily and that C/D box snoRNA-like molecules are produced from many more genomic loci than are currently annotated. We further found that C/D box snoRNAs are very specifically processed inside the regions of terminal complementarity, retaining in the mature form only four to five nucleotides upstream of the C box and two to five nucleotides downstream of the D box. Sequencing of the small RNA population as well as of the small RNAs isolated after Ago2 immunoprecipitation revealed that despite their cellular abundance, C/D box-derived small RNAs are not efficiently incorporated into the Ago2 protein. Our extensive data thus indicate that, contrary to previous suggestions [25, 33], snoRNA-derived small RNAs that carry out non-canonical, particularly miRNA-like, functions are rare., To gain insight into the processing of snoRNAs and the functions of snoRNA-derived small RNAs, we performed PAR-CLIP experiments with snoRNP core proteins. Analysis of PAR-CLIP reads showed that C/D box core proteins Fibrillarin, NOP56 and NOP58 have a very similar binding pattern, overlapping with the box elements. Excluding snoRNA families SNORD113 to SNORD116, which are multi-copy families and do not have guide complementarity to rRNAs or snRNAs, snoRNA-LBME-db currently lists 153 C/D box snoRNAs, of which 40 and 78 have a guide region targeting a known modification at the D box and D' box, respectively. Evolutionary conservation profiles of the remaining putative guide regions suggest that most of them are not functional. In support of this concept, our analysis revealed that C/D box core proteins cross-linked more effectively to guide regions that are known to have a target compared to orphan guide regions., Combining computational prediction with data from small RNA sequencing and PAR-CLIP we identified novel C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs, and assigned guiding snoRNAs to several modifications on rRNAs and snRNAs that were previously described as orphans. In addition to these bona fide snoRNAs, we uncovered a group of C/D box-like snoRNAs that only have a C and a D box as opposed to the common C-D'-C'-D architecture. These C/D box-like snoRNAs are only weakly conserved and most of them are expressed at low levels. The unusual architecture and the weak evolutionary conservation are likely reasons why these RNA species have not been uncovered by computational ncRNA gene finders [57]. Some of the identified C/D box-like snoRNAs are extremely short, one being only 27 nucleotides in length, leaving hardly enough space for a guide region. The requirements for C/D box snoRNA biogenesis appear to be simply the presence of C and D boxes and a short region of complementarity flanking these boxes, leading probably to the production of many snoRNA-like molecules as the C/D box core proteins scan intronic regions of pre-mRNAs. An interesting lead to follow in further investigating the potential function of the C/D box-like snoRNAs originating in the introns of many genes comes from a recent study conducted in Drosophila, in which Schubert and colleagues showed that snoRNAs are required for maintenance of higher-order structures of chromatin accessibility [58]., In our PAR-CLIP experiments we also repeatedly cross-linked ncRNAs that are not usual snoRNA targets. We observed H/ACA box snoRNAs in PAR-CLIP experiments targeting the C/D box core proteins. Vice versa, we found C/D box snoRNAs in the PAR-CLIP targeting Dyskerin, which is an essential component of H/ACA box snoRNPs. Primer extension assays indicated that these snoRNAs carry modifications that would be expected from the protein complexes to which they were cross-linked, but we were, in general, not able to identify snoRNAs that could guide these modifications. One drawback may be that in the case of the 2'-O-methyl primer extension assays we cannot be sure that it was indeed a 2'-O-methyl modification as opposed to any other nucleoside modification that caused the stoppage of the reverse transcriptase. However, we can be fairly certain that we identified bona fide pseudouridylation sites. Particularly, in the case of SNORD35A we were able to identify five putative pseudouridylated residues but no convincing guiding sequence in a known H/ACA box snoRNA. This suggests either that even more snoRNAs remain to be identified or that these pseudouridylations are caused by a protein-only mechanism not requiring guidance by H/ACA box snoRNAs., The processing patterns of snoRNAs have raised substantial interest and some controversy in recent years [30, 32, 59]. We strikingly found that snoRNA excision out of the intron follows a well-defined pattern leaving mature snoRNAs with four to five nucleotides upstream of the C box, and two to five nucleotides downstream of the D box, irrespective of the length of the terminal closing stem. Our data support the observations of Darzacq and Kiss [5] that the terminal stem serves to bring the C and D box elements into close proximity so as to be more easily recognized by snoRNP proteins, which then protect the snoRNA from further trimming by the exosome, but may not be needed for the functional, mature snoRNA. This implies that the core proteins actively protect and stabilize the maturing snoRNA., We further quantified the abundance of snoRNA-derived small RNAs in HEK293 cells, and consistent with other studies [29], we found that small RNAs derived from the ends of C/D box snoRNAs are indeed abundant. However, we did not find evidence that these sdRNAs efficiently associate with Ago2 to act as microRNAs, even in conditions when the accessibility of these sdRNAs to Ago2 should be higher, such as in mitotic cells. We thus conclude that a microRNA-like function of snoRNA-derived small RNAs is an exception rather than a rule. Most of the sdRNAs from C/D box snoRNAs originate from the termini of mature snoRNAs, and hence carry C and D box motifs. It might be that snoRNA core proteins are still attached to these fragments, protect them from total degradation, sequester them in the nucleus and prevent these sdRNAs from being loaded into Ago2., Deep-sequencing-based studies revealed a very complex landscape of transcription and processing of RNAs. The non-canonical products identified initially in such studies raises the question of additional, yet unknown, functions of molecules that have been studied for many years. What has become apparent more recently, however, is that deep sequencing allows us to construct a very detailed picture of the kinetics of processing various classes of RNAs and of their interactions with proteins that protect them from degradation. Intersection of many data sets such as those generated in our study will eventually reveal kinetic and regulatory aspects of cellular processes at a fine level of detail."
"55","Are there unequivocal criteria to label a given protein as a toxin? Permissive versus conservative annotation processes","Yves Terrat, Frédéric Ducancel","Montréal University/Institute in Plant Biology, Montreal Botanical Garden, Antibody Engineering for Health Laboratory (LIAS), CEA/iBiTecS/SPI/LIAS","Yves Terrat","yves.terrat@umontreal.ca","3 September 2013","","","As correctly mentioned by Whittington et al., most proteins found in venoms are the result of toxin recruitment events in which an ordinary protein gene, typically one involved in a key regulatory process, is duplicated, and the new gene is selectively expressed in the venom gland. In many cases, such toxin genes are amplified to obtain multigene families with extensive neofunctionalization [10, 16, 17]. Alternatively, the similarities shared with non-venom-related genes could also originate from a process of convergent evolution. In both cases, the result is a high probability of retrieving non-venom-related genes through a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) similarity search using the given toxin as the query. Based on these observations, Whittington and colleagues state that rejecting potential platypus venom genes on the basis of similarities with a non-venom gene is inappropriate. However much we agree with this point, we suggest that additional validation steps have to be performed to ensure that the toxin candidate is not in itself a non-venom gene, for the following reasons. First, the annotation process adopted by Whittington and co-workers is particularly sensitive to detection of false positives because it uses the Tox-Prot database enriched in vertebrate toxins [18] as a query to perform a TBLASTN search on the platypus cDNA database. Second, their conclusions were derived largely from top BLAST hit results, and that might increase the chance of retrieving cellular genes commonly expressed in vertebrate cells. Third, strong similarities to non-venom-related genes are discussed for some families, but no clear procedure is used to evaluate their impact. Finally, the likelihood of each candidate to be a toxin is evaluated through tissue-expression criteria, an approach for which the false detection rate needs further investigation., First, in order to validate the putative venom function of BLAST-annotated candidates, the authors chose to screen EST databases of different platypus tissues. Candidates expressed in at least three non-venomous tissues were removed. We believe that this criterion is not stringent enough for several reasons. First, as also mentioned by the authors, venom compounds could be expressed at a basal level in various tissues, much in the same way as non-venom-related genes could be expressed in venomous tissues. This could lead to both the rejection of true candidates and the annotation of a false-positive as toxin. From a statistical point of view, this 'switch-on/switch-off' approach lacks both power and sensitivity., The second issue of this validation step is that, depending on the size of the different tissue databases, some compounds could simply be missing owing to sampling effects. For instance, the authors used an EST database of fibroblast cell lines that includes 9,699 EST sequences available in GenBank. In this database, we identified 8,813 ESTs from 'true' fibroblast cell lines. The remainder (886 sequences) include both liver and spleen cDNA of low quality (mean length of 176 bp, standard error of 94 bp). Unfortunately, we were unable to evaluate the size and quality of the bill, brain, liver, spleen and testis databases generated for the platypus genome because we were unable to locate them. The original 2008 Nature journal publication of the platypus genome only mentioned the fibroblast cell line database, which was used to add experimental support to the in silico gene prediction [15]. In Whittington and colleagues' study, only a small number of transcripts were generated (probably the 8,813 ESTs mentioned above)., Our final point is that, if one looks closely at the Illumina read counts for the toxin candidates, more than one-third of the putative candidates match fewer than 50 Illumina reads (about 3.10 × 10-6 of the total reads), and three of them were not even detected in the Illumina reads but in the 454 reads only. To us, it seems rather contradictory to try to validate a very low transcribed toxin through tissue expression criteria - it lacks at least some statistical support., For all these reasons, we believe that the tissue expression criteria will not be valid until applied, with caution, in combination with databases generated through high-throughput means., The starting point that led us to reconsider the toxin list was the discovery of a sarafotoxin sequence (SRTX) in the platypus transcriptome. SRTXs are highly toxic components isolated from the venom of scarce Atractaspis snakes. SRTXs are similar to the endothelins (ETs) of vertebrates, which function as potent vasoconstrictors and act by means of identical receptors [19–23]. However, the similarity between SRTX and ET sequences is restricted to the endothelin region that corresponds to the mature peptide (approximately 21 amino acids in length; Figure 1a). The SRTX sequence presented by Whittington et al. (named edn1_O.ananitus in our study) is clearly labeled as a 'previously unknown toxin' and seems not to be expressed (or at least detected) in non-venom tissues. Because of its ranking in the list, the authors classified this unknown toxin in the top 33 list of 'probable (likely)' platypus venom genes. In our opinion, this sequence could be excluded from the original list for many reasons, as summarized below.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Schematic representation, protein sequence alignment and maximum likelihood (ML) nucleotidic phylogeny of endothelin and sarafotoxin sequences. The novel toxin gene identified by Whittington and colleagues (named edn1_O.ananitus) is identified by an orange star. For each endothelin (ET) group, we used two mammalian sequences (Homo sapiens and Mus musculus), one archosaurian sequence (Gallus gallus), one amphibian sequence (Xenopus laevis) and one actinopterygian sequence (Danio rerio). Only one copy of the fish-specific-duplicated edn-2 and edn-3 gene products was used in the alignment and in the phylogenetic analysis for D. rerio. Sequences from the fish-specific edn4 group have not been included. (a) The ET-like structure is represented at the top of the figure; the SRTX-like structure is represented at the bottom. The 'X' used in the alignment for Sarafotoxin sequences means that no homologous regions are identified. Three different sarafotoxin isoforms isolated from Atractaspis microlepidota and encoded on the same precursor are used for multiple alignment. The dots used in the alignment for edn2 of the Ornithorhynchus ananitus sequence indicate missing data. The threshold for identity/similarity shading is 80%. (b) ML was performed on the ET/SRTX region of 108 bp using the generalized time-reversible plus invariant plus gamma (GTR+I+G) model. Topology is rooted with sarafotoxin sequences. Bootstrap values greater than 90% are indicated. The identified edn-1, edn-2 and edn-3 platypus sequences are indicated in red.
                    , First, the transcript presents a typical ET-type and not a SRTX-type organization (Figure 1a). SRTXs and ETs contain a common core of approximately 21 amino acids (containing the endothelin peptide) but have different precursor organizations: SRTXs from members of the Atractaspis genus present various repetitions of the ET motif, whereas the precursors of ETs contain a single and complete 21 amino acid motif followed by one peptide of 16 residues that displays a highly divergent amino acid composition, except for the conserved cysteine residues, a so-called 'ET-like' core motif (Figure 1a)., Second, the putative venom gene identified by Whittington and colleagues shares more similarities to ET sequences (71% identity and 82% similarity with endothelin-1 from Mus musculus on the full-length sequence of 202 amino acids) than to any SRTX sequences (the best score for Atractaspis microlepidota SRTX with 15 of 21 residues identical is restricted to the endothelin region; see alignment in Figure 1a). Indeed, it is nearly perfectly identical to the endothelin-1 annotation suggested by the Ensembl genebuild., In order to establish the phylogenetic position of the putative toxin, we performed a maximum likelihood (ML) analysis using the complete endothelin platypus repertory (edn1, edn2 and edn3 identified by Braasch and colleagues [24]), a subset of orthologous vertebrate sequences (edn1, edn2 and edn3 but not edn4 fish-specific genes) and SRTX sequences. We were unable to identify full-length edn2 and edn3 sequences owing to low conservation outside the 'big-endothelin' region and the ambiguous sequenced regions of genomic contigs. Thus, the nucleotide phylogeny of endothelin genes was reconstructed using 108 bp within the 'big-endothelin' domain. The endothelin phylogeny (Figure 1b) confirms that the 'new sarafotoxin-like gene' groups within the edn1 clade. These results are in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis performed by Brassch and collaborators that included numerous ETs and SRTXs., Finally, we performed synteny analysis of the Ultracontig 474, which contains the gene encoding edn-1. We found that the syntenic relationship of the edn-1 block among vertebrates is also conserved for the platypus (data not shown). Combining gene organization, similarity/identity evidence, phylogenetic analysis and syntenic conservation of the edn-1 block, we believe that this sequence should not be labeled as a toxin but probably be considered as possessing an endogenous function, comparable to that of edn-1 sequences found in most vertebrates. Of course, with a pure bioinformatics approach, it is not possible to exclude the possibility of a toxin nature for this sequence. However, our analysis produces the most parsimonious hypothesis., Indeed, ambiguous annotations are suspected for most of the new platypus toxin candidates. For instance, the putative C-type lectin 1 identified in the platypus transcriptome matches over nearly 3,500 amino acids in length on Uniprot sequences and less than 200 amino acids on the most similar Tox-prot sequences. Focusing on the matching domain (Figure 2), we observed that the C-type lectin domain (which is the only functional domain of relevant toxins) represents a small carboxy-terminal part of the full-length platypus toxin candidates (less than 4% of the full platypus protein sequence). The domain organization is indeed more similar to mammalian versican proteins, which also present a C-type lectin domain [25]. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, the C-type lectin domain itself is more related to non-venom lacticans (versican/aggrecan and neurocan protein; data not shown). Thus, it is more parsimonious to propose that this putative C-type lectin 1 sequence is involved in an endogenous function. Similar results were found for other toxin candidates, such as the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 19, latrotoxin 27, latrotoxin 116 and the 'no-hits 93' and 'no-hits 96' sequences (no similar sequences on the Tox-Prot database).
                    Figure 2
                      
                        Comparative analysis of the domain organization of the C-type lectin-domain-containing protein. The dataset includes representative sequences of each protein group similar to the putative C-type lectin toxin. The different groups were identified after phylogenetic analysis of BLASTp hits retrieved on Tox-Prot and Uniprot databases associated with an e-value below 1E-05. To identify domains similar to those of platypus sequence parts, an alignment of the putative toxin and similar hits was performed using BLASTp. Domains associated with an e-value less than 1E-05 are indicated by colored boxes. The only shared motif is the C-type lectin domain. A sequence logo of the multiple alignment of C-type-lectin domains is represented above. Compared are the rat Rattus norvegicus, the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, the water snake Enhydris polylepsis, the toadfish Thalassophryne natterei and the pit viper Trimeresurus flavoviridis.
                    , The rejected venom genes mostly concern Kunitz-type proteases and latrotoxins. These protein families contain ankyrin and Kunitz-type domains, which are widespread among non-venom-related gene products. Consequently, they are good 'seeds' to retrieve many sequenced genes through BLAST search analyses. Most of the new toxin candidates from these families contain such domains, but, as is the case in the above-mentioned examples, similarity to previously characterized toxins is restricted to a single domain., Acceptance or rejection of a toxin candidate is quite complex, at the bioinformatic level as well as through benchwork analyses. From our point of view, unequivocal criteria do not exist. It is certain, however, that, when adopting a bioinformatics approach, prudent choice of a database resolves some issues. The dataset used as a query should include toxin as well as non-toxin-related genes. We will briefly touch upon the remaining issues. To start with, there is no reason to assume that toxin candidates evolved from identical paralogous copies in different taxa - that is, toxins of the same family might not cluster together within a monophyletic group. Moreover, we agree with Whittington and colleagues that, following a very recent recruitment of a common protein after a duplication event, the new toxin is hypothesized to be very similar to the original 'proof'. However, the application of a more conservative validation criterion leads to the rejection of most 'novel venom genes' presented in this study. Hence, we believe that the annotation process used by Whittington and colleagues is too permissive. Their tissue-expression criterion is only valid when performed on high-throughput-generated datasets and should also include statistically sound comparative arguments to validate candidates associated with a broad range of transcription levels. Finally, we agree with the authors that functional analyses have to be performed to confirm or refute the toxic activity of a given sequence. Nevertheless, in vitro and in vivo validation of in silico candidates will always need to be approached with the utmost caution. After all, any compound, depending on dosage, could potentially act as a toxin., 
                Camilla M Whittington, Anthony T Papenfuss, Katherine Belov and Wesley C Warren respond:
              , The correspondence by Terrat and Ducancel raises some valid points about the limitations of our annotation of the platypus venom gland transcriptome [8]. While we agree that our annotation methodology was permissive (and have stated as much in our manuscript, referring to the platypus venom genes as 'putative'), we believe that it represents the best approach, given the data and methods available at the time., While Terrat and Ducancel do provide some interesting new analytical techniques, in particular refuting our annotation of a sarafotoxin-like sequence and a C-type lectin as putative venom genes, which we concede might be the case, it is worth noting that approximately 50% of members of families singled out as false positives by Terrat and Ducancel are not included in our list of likely venom genes passing our more stringent criteria. For our more permissive dataset (83 genes), our choice of screening out putative venom genes based on expression in 50% of the available non-venom platypus EST libraries represents an effort to strike a balance between avoiding false positives and excluding true venom genes from further analysis, given that we have previously shown that platypus venom genes can be expressed in non-venom tissues [26]. We used more stringent criteria to identify a subset of likely venom genes (33 genes) that were not expressed in any non-venom tissues., In addition, Terrat and Ducancel have misunderstood parts of our annotation process. Their statements about our annotation using TBLASTN to search Tox-Prot proteins against the platypus cDNA database miss the point that we utilized BLAST searches of Tox-Prot sequences against the platypus genome. The authors also refer to the use of our expression data in a quantitative way, stating that more than one-third of the putative candidates match fewer than 50 Illumina reads. We do not believe that this is valid, owing to the fact that the library was normalized before sequencing. As evidence, we cite the platypus genome manuscript where, in the supplementary notes, a description of the library preparation method is found. In brief, the optimally cycled cDNA product is boiled and allowed to re-anneal, and, during this time, the high-copy molecules re-anneal, whereas the low-copy molecules maintain the single-stranded state, achieving normalization. This would account for the low copy number of potential venom genes. While it is possible to conclude, as we have, that high read counts in normalized libraries probably indicate high expression in situ, it is not valid to perform the reverse comparison and conclude that low read counts in normalized libraries indicate low expression in situ. Their argument that some of our putative toxins are probably non-toxins given that they are more related to non-venom proteins than to venom sequences is flawed as one might expect this given the degree of divergence between platypuses and other venomous species, and recruitment of specific domains might result in only partial homology to known toxins. We also disagree with the use of synteny data to infer non-venom function as we have previously shown that genes with venom function are conserved in a syntenic block with related non-toxin genes [27]., We clearly state in our article that our analysis is a first-pass analysis of the platypus venom transcriptome, and we discuss the limitations of our approach. While we agree with Terrat and Ducancel that our criteria were permissive, we stand by the use of these permissive criteria, as we did not want to exclude any potential venom genes from further study. We discuss in our manuscript the fact that further research, including functional testing, is required before any of the putative toxins can be definitively classified as novel platypus venom toxins. This fact is also recognized by Terrat and Ducancel, who concede that they are unable to refute definitively our designation of putative platypus venom toxins without functional testing., A first-pass analysis of the transcriptome is a necessary step towards identifying new venom toxins, and the results we obtained are valid with our methodology. As with many in silico analyses, a change in methodology will affect the results. This is inevitable with any re-analysis of genomic data, as bioinformatic methods evolve over time. We have thus undertaken follow-up studies to address some of the concerns raised in both articles. These include improved phylogenetic analyses, with an investigation of genes under positive selection [28], as well as sequencing of in-season and out-of-breeding-season venom glands in order to identify differentially expressed venom genes, which we combined with proteomics work [29]., In conclusion, although we agree that Terrat and Ducancel raise some valid points, we disagree with several of their arguments and have addressed other issues in our further research, some of which is already published., Correspondence should be sent to Wesley C Warren: The Genome Institute, Washington University School of Medicine, Campus Box 8501, 4444 Forest Park Avenue, St Louis, MO 63108, USA.

One of the natural consequences following from current advances in sequencing technology is that there are more and more researchers sequencing new genomes. These researchers require tools to describe the functional features of their newly sequenced genomes. With Web Apollo researchers can use any of the common browsers (for example, Chrome or Firefox) to jointly analyze and precisely describe the features of a genome in real time, whether they are in the same room or working from opposite sides of the world., The multitude of genome browsers in genomics all grew out of the need to 'see' the full array of predictions and alignments, their relative positions and their component parts. Among these are a small number of more sophisticated genome 'editors' which allow users to go beyond passive viewing to interactively modifying and refining precise locations and structures of genome functional elements. The desktop version of Apollo [1], Artemis [2], and FMAP [3] are all examples of such tools. The genome sequencing and annotation paradigm typically involved a large, national genome center that undertook the raw sequencing in coordination with gene prediction pipelines and subsequent manual curation (for example, RefSeq [4], Ensembl [5], FlyBase [6], Wormbase [7], Saccharomyces Genome Database [8], The Arabidopsis Information Resource [9], and Mouse Genome Informatics [10]). The Model Organism Databases (MODs) often include staff members (that is, biocurators) who review and amend the gene structures. The Human and Vertebrate Analysis and Annotation (HAVANA) team at the Sanger Institute manually annotates the human [11], mouse [12], and zebrafish [13] genomes. The amended predictions are subsequently used either as training sets or as empirical standards whose alignments are used to improve prediction software's accuracy. For example, the HAVANA team uses their in-house genome editor (Otterlace [14]) to manually annotate, and then the improved annotations are fed back into the Ensembl [15] pipeline during subsequent quarterly runs [16]., Unfortunately, while this model of a central biocuration team is considered the gold standard for genome annotation, it scales poorly. Technical advances have made sequencing faster and cheaper, thereby democratizing genome-scale sequencing and allowing a rapidly growing number of researchers to launch sequencing projects ranging from population, to evolutionary, to phenotype, to disease, to classroom projects across a huge spectrum of organisms. And, while next generation sequencing technology provides annotators with significantly more information, this, perhaps paradoxically, actually increases the need for manual review because there are more biological data points to assess and integrate. Individual researchers and small research groups do not have access to a centralized biocuration team, but their need for hand curation is often greater than that of a large genome center due to their focused interest in a particular gene family, pathway or evolutionary relationship, and the generally lower quality of the genome assembly., An ideal solution would conceptually be a 'genome wiki', where curators could collaboratively edit genome annotations online, much like the distributed curators of a wiki document [17]. Biological text corpora, successfully exposed to 'crowd-sourced' curation via the wiki-type model, include Wikipedia pages directly associated with human genes [18] along with pages for protein [19] and RNA domain families [20]. Other projects offer similar wiki-like editing features for text, including revision control [21]. However, while editable textboxes have been present in browsers since the earliest days of the web, a completely integrated genome editor that operates seamlessly in the web browser (and saves annotations to a persistent data store in a client-server model) has been lacking. The natural user interface for genome data is the genome browser, and a true 'genome wiki' should allow curators to edit annotations seamlessly from within the genome browser., For this reason, we built Web Apollo, a browser-based genome editor that supports geographically dispersed researchers whose work is coordinated through automatic synchronization. The overall platform is currently comprised of a visualization component - JBrowse [22], and an editing and user authentication component - Apollo. Just as the costs of sequencing have gone down our aim was to make manual annotation correspondingly cost-effective. With Web Apollo the task of manual curation is spread out among many hands and eyes, enabling the creation of virtual research networks of researchers linked by a common interest in a particular organism or population (Figure 1).

                        Web Apollo architecture. Web Apollo (components within the central turquoise box) acts as a mediating agent between users (top blue box) and external sources and sinks of data (lower green and peach boxes). Two user interface components operate on the client-side, within the browser environment. The JBrowse component visualizes various DNA features, and the Web Apollo component captures user manipulations. The Data Services module dynamically delivers genomic data and features to the user interface as JBrowse compatible JSON. Most of the primary genomic data is harvested and formatted in advance as part of the initial server setup. In addition, data from other sources may be dynamically provided using the Trellis framework or uploaded by the user from the browser. The Annotation Editing Engine and User Management components also sit on the server side. The first responds to users actions on the client by modifying the underlying data models appropriately, and second manages user accounts and login services. Annotations created by users can be exported as either GFF3 or FASTA file, or directly saved to a Chado database (plug-in adapters may be added to export genomic annotations to additional repositories). The arrows indicate where there are interactions between components, with the arrowhead indicating the direction of data flow.
                    , Our development team included investigators representing multiple genome research communities who carried out usability testing to evaluate the effectiveness of Web Apollo's interface and annotation management. We took this user-centered-design approach to ensure real world usability was built into the system from the ground up. They evaluated usability by revising annotations for honeybee (Apis mellifera) and, from the outset, for community annotation of insect genomes such as ants (Cardiocondyla obscurior, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, and Wasmannia auropunctata), leading to a better understanding of the biology of these insects and simultaneously evaluating the effectiveness of the software., This section briefly explains Web Apollo's core operations for importing data, editing, and exporting protein-coding gene models. Additionally we describe additional features supporting the annotation of corrections to lower quality genome assemblies, import and visualization of transcriptome data, and real-time collaboration., Given that manual annotation is critical to achieving accurate and reliable gene models the issue now becomes how can this process be scaled up to meet the needs of the growing number of genome research projects taking place at smaller facilities and in individual labs. With the shift in sequence data generation, the burden of curation is falling largely on research consortia or ad hoc community efforts. Some sequencing centers have supported consortium annotation efforts, either by providing websites for community members to submit annotations (for example, [34–38]), by collaborating with a centralized, external genome annotation group (for example, [39–42]), or by providing Otterlace (for example, [43]). However, more and more often research communities are organizing manual curation efforts among themselves, independent of sequencing centers., Desktop Apollo gained popularity among smaller groups and over time it became one of the standards used by smaller-scale genome projects in research communities dispersed throughout the world. However, its original design legacy did not make it a perfect fit for the needs of these smaller genome projects. Installation was at times an insurmountable technical hurdle for groups lacking an on-site bioinformaticist. Furthermore, there was no support for automatically sharing annotations among members of the research team. Groups were constrained to saving files to disk and e-mailing these to one another, which is slow, inconvenient, and creates additional bookkeeping work as conflicts were resolved by database curators taking the time to contact the disagreeing annotators individually. With the need to provide a seamlessly integrated annotation flow for smaller teams of researchers in mind we built Web Apollo focusing on support for collaborative annotation efforts. By being browser-based it allows users to see changes made by collaborators working on the same region, in real time, which enables community annotators to quickly resolve issues among themselves directly. Early in the project we made the decision to build the Web Apollo client using the visualization techniques of an existing web-based genome browser, JBrowse [22], the best of the genome browsers alternatives available, thereby lowering overall development costs., Web Apollo also addresses two key requirements that are particular to the smaller community annotation projects [44, 45]. First, recent research communities tend to organize into teams based on areas of biological expertise, often preferring to annotate specific genes or gene families, rather than entire scaffolds. Web Apollo allows users to quickly identify their specific loci of interest by integrating BLAT sequence comparison as an optional entry point. Second, the norm for smaller sequencing efforts is fragmented rather than polished assemblies. Web Apollo scaffold list sorting features provide easy access to scaffolds based on identifiers, even when the assembly consists of tens of thousands of scaffolds., The establishment of best practices and quality control becomes increasingly important with the wide range of genomic expertise available within different research communities. Research projects must develop appropriate standards given their data and offer some training to assure the success of any community annotation project. The built-in quality control features of Web Apollo are similar to those used in desktop Apollo and other annotation editors such as Otterlace. These include flagging non-consensus splice sites and validating translation of coding sequences. In addition we have developed tutorials and a demonstration site to train users in the gestures required for annotation. Accessibility over the web makes it easy to hold long-distant training sessions., But perhaps most importantly for the continued improvement of the annotations is that Web Apollo allows continued input to gene annotation as long as a server is maintained for the genome, thus researchers can continue to improve annotations as more data is collected over time. If a research community chooses to follow the 'gatekeeper' approach to community annotation [46], Web Apollo also makes it easy for the gatekeeper to view and revise annotations., Web Apollo is comprised of three components: a web-based client, an annotation editing server, and a server-side data service that provides the client with data from different files and databases (Figure 1). These three software components are open source and available free of charge., The first version of Web Apollo was released in December 2012 [70]. At the time of this publication Web Apollo has been downloaded 179 times, from 104 unique IP addresses. Web Apollo is implemented in JavaScript, Java, and Perl, with all major browsers supported. The source code is freely available and maintained in Google Code [71] (server) and GitHub [72] (client). Detailed information can be found online [73], including a user guide [74] and demonstration site."

The involvement of processing bodies in stress response suggests a role for decapping-mediated mRNA degradation. However, little is known about the role of mRNA degradation under stressful environmental conditions., Here, we perform a global study of uncapped mRNAs, via parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE), under cold stress in Brachypodium distachyon. Enrichment analysis indicates that degradation products detected by PARE are mainly generated by the decapping pathway. Endonucleolytic cleavages are detected, uncovering another way of modulating gene expression. PARE and RNA-Seq analyses identify four types of mRNA decay patterns. Type II genes, for which light-harvesting processes are over-represented in gene ontology analyses, show unchanged transcript abundance and altered uncapped transcript abundance. Uncapping-mediated transcript stability of light harvesting-related genes changes significantly in response to cold stress, which may allow rapid adjustments in photosynthetic activity in response to cold stress. Transcript abundance and uncapped transcript abundance for type III genes changes in opposite directions in response to cold stress, indicating that uncapping-mediated mRNA degradation plays a role in regulating gene expression., To our knowledge, this is the first global analysis of mRNA degradation under environmental stress conditions in Brachypodium distachyon.

              ","Degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is one of the key factors determining mRNA abundance in a cell. Proper degradation of mRNA is crucial for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and enables rapid and precise adjustment of gene expression in response to various environmental stimulus[1, 2]. The study of mRNA degradation in plants has fallen behind compared with what has been done in other organisms and recent advances in this area provide us with only preliminary knowledge about plant RNA decay pathways[3–5]. For normal mRNAs, degradation is believed to initiate with deadenylation, the deadenylated mRNA can then either be degraded in the 3'-5' direction in a process mediated by the exosome or be decapped and then degraded in the 5'-3' direction[3]. Alternatively, mRNA decay in plants can be initiated with internal cleavage(s), for example, by miRNA- or siRNA-directed RISC degradation[6–9]. The mechanism of aberrant mRNAs degradation in plants is largely unknown, except for the identification of some key enzymes in the plant nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway[10, 11]. Obviously, our understanding of the degradation pathways in plants is still far from complete., In eukaryotic cells, decapping is a critical step in mRNA turnover as it requires the stop of translation and the change of mRNAs into a non-translating state, which makes them accessible for further degradation. Decapping, to a large extent, competes with translation for the access to the 5' cap structure, which determines whether the mRNAs will be degraded or translated[12–15]. Recently, ribosomes are reported to be allowed to bind to mRNAs and complete translation before the transcript is ultimately degraded[16]. Messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) that are translationally repressed and associated with the decapping machinery can assemble into granules, named as processing bodies (PBs) [17, 18]. The assembly of PBs occurs primarily in response to stress stimuli, and the size of PBs has been found to increase significantly under stress conditions[19], implying that PBs play an important role during plant stress responses. Furthermore, PBs co-localize with stress granules (SGs), suggesting that they probably interact with each other and function together in stress responses[19–21]. The significant increase of PBs in response to stress and their close connection with SGs indicate that mRNA decay, especially the decapping pathway, plays an important role in cellular stress responses[22, 23]. However, little information is available for a complete view of mRNA degradation under stress conditions., In this study, uncapped transcriptome has been analyzed with a deep sequencing approach, parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE)[24]. Taking advantage of the modified 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and high-throughput deep sequencing, PARE was developed to identify 5'-phosphorylated, polyadenylated RNAs[24]. In most cases, it was used to identify potential targets for miRNA-directed cleavages[25–28]. In mouse, this approach was employed to perform a global analysis of the RNA degradome[29, 30]. This kind of application, as far as we know, was seldom reported in plant, except for a microarray study with similar experimental principle[31]. Here, this approach was employed to study mRNA degradation under cold stress condition in Brachypodium distachyon, a new monocot model plant [32]. Our studies will not only improve our understanding of mRNA degradation mechanism under stress conditions, but also provide deeper insight into how monocot plants respond to low temperature stress., In response to cold stress, eukaryotic cells effectively regulate gene expression through rapidly adjusting their transcriptome[74–76]. Transcript abundance is the equilibrium between the rates of mRNA synthesis and degradation. Up to now, relatively little is known about mRNA degradation. Although the involvement of PBs in stress responses suggested that mRNA decay, especially the decapping pathway, may play a role under stress condition, further experimental evidence is needed in this area. To a certain extent, mRNA degradation is only assumed to be a factor determining the speed by which the transcript abundance is adjusted[77]. Our results indicated that mRNA degradation did play a role in the regulation of steady-state transcript abundance. For example, the opposite change of transcript and uncapped transcript abundance for type III genes uncovered the obvious contribution of uncapping to gene expression regulation (Table 1). Moreover, genome-wide analysis of mRNA degradation under cold stress will deepen our understanding of mRNA degradation and stress response mechanism in plants., Our global analysis provides a complete view of uncapping-mediated mRNA degradation and its related degradation pathways under cold stress. Specific degradation patterns have been uncovered. Endonucleolytic cleavages, another way to modulate gene expression in cold stress response, were revealed. Our results will not only deepen our understanding of mRNA degradation under stress condition, but also help us to gain deeper insight into the cold stress response mechanism of economically important winter-habit crops and biofuel grasses, which has close evolutionary relationship with Brachypodium."

Not accounting for these confounders leads to biased results. We develop a statistical methodology that estimates and adjusts for celltype composition by decomposing neuronal and non-neuronal differential signal. This method provides a conceptual framework for deconvolving heterogeneous epigenetic data from postmortem brain studies. We apply it to find cell-specific differentially methylated regions between prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We demonstrate the utility of the method on both Infinium 450k and CHARM data., The brain is a particularly good example of highly specialized and diverse functions arising from the same genetic program. Epigenetic mechanisms copy information other than the sequence itself during cell division, such as DNA methylation and chromatin arrangements [1]. Therefore, epigenetics is an attractive substrate for understanding specialized brain function and its disruption in disease. An example of an epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation, which at CpG dinucleotides is heritable during cell division, because that sequence is recognized by a DNA methyltransferase on newly replicated strands. In post-mitotic cells such as neurons, DNA methylation has been shown to contribute to memory formation [2], other types of synaptic plasticity [3], drug addiction [4], and reversible behavior in the honeybee Apis mellifera [5]. Neurological diseases have also been linked to mutations in DNA methyltransferases [6] and methyl-CpG-binding proteins [7]., Despite its importance, the epigenetic profile of the brain has not yet been explored in depth due to, among other factors, brain region and cell-type heterogeneity. The cerebral cortex has distinct functional regions, each organized into cell layers of neurons and glia that vary throughout the cortex [8]. While neurons are the main signaling unit, glia play an important role in scaffolding and maintaining synapses [9]. Epigenetic profiling of neurons and non-neurons using the Illumina GoldenGate assay has shown that neurons and glia have a unique DNA methylation signature that cannot be assessed using samples from bulk cortex [10]. This is important because shifts in glial cell populations such as oligodendrocytes contribute to defects in cortical myelination, and microglia activation has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders [11]., Traditional epidemiological studies using brain tissue done so far do not account for differences in cell-type composition [12–14]. Statistical methods for estimating cell-type composition from genomic profiles have been developed for gene expression [15–18], and DNA methylation in blood tissue [19] and in brain [20]. DNA methylation can then be used to calculate and potentially adjust for differing cell proportions, a crucial step when studying diseases where cell population shifts occur [21]., While DNA methylation data can now be used to calculate differing cell proportions, individual cell-type profiling has not been done yet due to the extensive mixture combinations required for validation in blood (at least five different cell types) [19]. In contrast, cell profiling in the brain can be achieved by separating the cell types into two main compartments: neurons and glia. In a recent publication [20], a method is proposed for estimating neuron and glia proportions similar to the approach proposed for whole blood [19]. While this is a useful step toward correcting for cell distribution, this approach does not permit the unbiased estimation of glia- and neuron-specific differences between two sets of samples [20]. Such calculated cell-type specific analysis offers a crucial advantage in studies of the brain, where neurons and glia cannot generally be dissociated. For example, many brain bank specimens contain pulverized material or even paraffin-fixed specimens, for which methods exist to isolate DNA for genome-scale methylation analysis [22]. Flow sorting, as done here to develop this method, generally does not yield sufficient quantities of material for genome-scale analysis, and is also extremely labor intensive and costly., Here we have developed a novel statistical epigenetics approach that takes advantage of the stability and cell-type specificity of DNA methylation, as well as the fact that the brain is made up of two major cell types, neurons and glia, in order to deconvolve the two main cell components in the brain. Thus, the method allows one to measure DNA methylation, for example, across brain regions, and from those data calculate to a first approximation the difference in DNA methylation that is neuron- or glia-specific. Moreover, once sorted data is available for a given brain region, investigators can use such data to calculate cell proportions on any unsorted sample measured on the same methylation platform without the need to sort themselves. This approach should have broad application to a range of problems in neurodevelopment and disease research., We describe an algorithm to address a gap in the analysis of methylation data from complex tissues with varying degrees of cell-type heterogeneity such as the brain. To appropriately measure the methylation differences between two brain cortical regions, we separated a small number of samples of the brain nuclei into neuronal and non-neuronal fractions by cell sorting, and developed a statistical method to account for cell heterogeneity in a set of unsorted samples by decomposing the signal into its two components. Our proposed method takes advantage of the separation of the brain cells into two nuclei fractions. The neuronal fraction encompasses a diverse population of neuronal cells, and the non-neuronal nuclei contain astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, a minority of NeuN-negative neurons, and endothelial cells. To separate the methylation signal into more than two fractions is mathematically plausible, as one can simply define 
                     as the fraction of cells of the cell-type of interest, fit model M2, and consider 
                    . However, investigating how robust our results are to the noise in cell fraction estimates when there are more than two cell types will require further study., The experimental design presented here provides for efficient use of scarce tissue bank resources and limited funds for methylation profiling. Once purified methylation profiles are obtained from the brain regions of interest using a small number of samples, the gold-standard methylation data can be used for any further analysis, and by any laboratory, without the need to sort nuclei again. We have demonstrated our method on data from both CHARM and the Illumina 450K array. To apply our method to a new measurement platform or new brain regions, we recommend performing cell sorting on a subset of the samples to first obtain the cell-type specific signals needed for the cell-fraction estimation. If brain-region specific data are not available, we have also shown that for samples measured with CHARM, accurate estimates of cell proportions in samples from one brain region could be obtained using sorted data from another brain region. We provide a framework that can be applied, even retrospectively, to psychiatric case-control studies using frozen postmortem brain samples, and can be easily adapted to other microarray or sequencing platforms, and to other target tissues."

Tet1 is expressed at high levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where it mediates the induction of 5hmC decoration on gene-regulatory elements. While the function of Tet1 is known, the mechanisms of its specificity remain unclear., We perform a genome-wide comparative analysis of 5hmC in pluripotent ESCs, as well as in differentiated embryonic and adult cells. We find that 5hmC co-localization with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is specific to ESCs and is absent in differentiated cells. Tet1 in ESCs is distributed on bivalent genes in two independent pools: one with Sin3a centered at non-hydroxymethylated transcription start sites and another centered downstream from these sites. This latter pool of Tet1 co-localizes with 5hmC and PRC2. Through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we show that Tet1 forms a complex with PRC2 specifically in ESCs. Genome-wide analysis of 5hmC profiles in ESCs following knockdown of the PRC2 subunit Suz12 shows a reduction of 5hmC within promoter sequences, specifically at H3K27me3-positive regions of bivalent promoters., In ESCs, PRC2 recruits Tet1 to chromatin at H3K27me3 positive regions of the genome, with 5hmC enriched in a broad peak centered 455 bp after the transcription start site and dependent on the PRC2 component Suz12. These results suggest that PRC2-dependent recruitment of Tet1 contributes to epigenetic plasticity throughout cell differentiation.","DNA-hydrossymethylation, Chip-Seq, PRC2, Stem Cells, Liver, Brain;Fibroblasts","In eukaryotic cells, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) occurs almost exclusively within a CpG context, and is catalyzed by the family of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes [1–3]. More recently, a number of studies have identified a mechanism of DNA demethylation involving the oxidation of 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which can function as a new epigenetic marker or as an intermediate toward further oxidative states by Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins [4–11]. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in embryonic and adult tissues, 5hmC modification occurs at high levels, whereas it is significantly reduced in cancer[12–17]. In ESCs, 5hmC is principally catalyzed by Tet1, which has high expression in these cells. Genome-wide studies in ESCs have shown 5hmC enrichment on regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies [18–27]. Tet1 depletion in ESCs leads to both transcriptional activation, in accordance with its role in oxidation of 5mC, and transcriptional repression [6, 20, 25, 28–32]. Genome-wide analysis have shown that Tet1 binding correlates with the transcriptional repressor Sin3a, which forms a nuclear complex with Tet1 and also with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) [19, 23, 25, 32]., PRC2 is the enzymatic complex that mediates the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) on developmental genes that determine whether the chromatin remains either open or fully inaccessible. It is formed by a core complex that includes Enhancer of Zeste 1 or 2 homolog (Ezh1 or Ezh2), Suppressor of Zeste 12 homolog (Suz12), Embryonic ectoderm development (Eed), and other accessory subunits, many of which are specific to ESCs [33–41]. PRC2 is involved in a number of different biological processes, and its dysregulation is associated with carcinogenesis [33, 42]., Using genome-wide analysis of 5hmC distribution in ESCs with respect to embryonic and adult tissues, we found that the overlap between the repressive modification H3K27me3 and 5hmC is ESC-specific, and we studied the molecular mechanism of the interplay between Tet1 and PRC2 in ESC., We compared the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC in ESCs, MEF, and terminally differentiated brain and liver tissues by GLIB-Seq analysis, which identified a similar enrichment of 5hmC on promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies, with a preference for exons in all cell types. A major difference between ESCs and other cell types is the correlation between 5hmC and H3K27me3, which is unique to ESCs, whereas this correlation is not present in differentiated fibroblasts or in adult tissues. We found that this difference is due to an ESC-specific functional interplay between Tet1 and the PRC2 complex., We found that in ESCs, but not in differentiated cells, PRC2 recruits Tet1 to the chromatin of bivalent genes to maintain their hypomethylated state. First, through in-depth analysis of previous ChIP-Seq data in ESCs, we found that Tet1 binds to chromatin with two different binding profiles: one, which is characterized by narrow peaks, is centered on the TSS of almost all genes and overlaps with Sin3a, while the other, which is characterized by broader peaks, is centered downstream of the promoters of bivalent genes and overlaps with PRC2. Second, co-immunoprecipitation showed that Tet1 interacts with PRC2 in ESCs but not in fibroblasts. Third, in ESCs, Suz12 silencing affected Tet1 binding and 5hmC modification at bivalent promoters specifically at PRC2-positive regions but not at other regions., Thus, our results show that Tet1, besides binding at the TSS together with Sin3a, is recruited by PRC2 downstream from the TSS at bivalent genes. The difference in the peak shape of the two binding profiles is compatible with the different recruitment mechanisms. In one case, Tet1 binds directly to the DNA on the TSS via its CXXC domain, which has high affinity for clustered unmethylated CpG dinucleotides [11], whereas in the other case, Tet1 is recruited by PRC2 to the chromatin. In this latter case, the binding of Tet1 and the distribution of 5hmC occupy larger regions, owing to the typical spread of PRC2 binding on bivalent promoters. Interestingly, Tet1, together with Sin3a, localizes to unmethylated TSSs, suggesting that, at these regions, this complex binds to unmethylated CpG or catalyzes the oxidation of 5mC to completion. Conversely, Tet1 binding with PRC2 overlaps with 5hmC on bivalent genes. Thus, our results are compatible with a model by which Tet1-dependent oxidation of 5mC is finely regulated to either eliminate DNA methylation or generate 5hmC epigenetic marks in different regions. Previous findings that MeCP2, Np95, and Mbd3 recognize 5hmC [10, 43–45] imply that this DNA modification can be a specific epigenetic signal., We found that PRC2 depletion from ESCs reduced Tet1 binding on bivalent promoters. This result differs from previous studies reporting that Ezh2 knockdown did not affect Tet1 binding [32]. This discrepancy could be because depletion of Ezh2 does not impair PRC2 binding to the chromatin or its methylation activity, because in ESCs, Ezh1 can complement Ezh2 function [39]. By contrast, knockdown of Suz12 destabilizes the complex [37]., We found that Tet1/PRC2 co-immunoprecipitation is ESC-specific, as we could not co-immunoprecipitate Tet1 with PRC2 in fibroblasts, and previous experiments failed to detect PRC2 proteins interacting with Tet1 in HEK293 cells [25]. These results suggest that the functional interaction between Tet1 and PRC2 in ESCs is either indirect, possibly mediated by one of the ESC-specific cofactors, or is dependent on post-translation modifications., We also found that the distribution of 5hmC on gene bodies is not tissue-specific, but increases with the level of gene expression in all cell types analyzed, suggesting that 5hmC acts as a positive activator by reducing the 5mC level. This regulation is confirmed by the recent finding that 5hmC was increased in gene bodies that were transcriptionally upregulated in a model of neuronal differentiation [46]. However, we found that genes expressed at very high levels showed little or no 5hmC, suggesting that DNA hydroxymethylation is not neutral but is mildly inhibitory on the transcription process. These results agree with in vitro experiments showing that 5hmC modifications are mildly repressive when present in the gene body [47]., We reported that PRC2 depletion reduced Tet1 binding and the presence of 5hmC at promoters of bivalent genes in ESCs. A previous report showed that Tet1 depletion results in the increased methylation and minor binding of PRC2 [32], most likely because Tet1-dependent demethylation facilitates PRC2 recruitment to the DNA, as methyl CpG counteracts the binding of PRC2. In fact, genome-wide analysis reported mutual exclusiveness of H3K27me3 with DNA methylation in CpG islands [48–51], and DNA methylation inhibits the binding of PRC2 in vitro [50]. Taken together, these results suggest a positive feedback loop between Tet1-dependent DNA demethylation and PRC2-dependent repression through H3K27me3 in ESCs in order to maintain developmental genes in the poised status. Thus, the presence of these two contrasting epigenetic markers on the same chromatin region is required to allow activation or repression of bivalent genes following action of developmental stimuli., Using genome-wide analysis, Suz12 silencing, and immunoprecipitation experiments we found that in ESCs, but not in other cell types, PRC2 recruits Tet1 to H3K27me3 regions. Our results identify a novel way by which Tet1 is recruited onto the chromatin, independent of its ability to bind directly to CpG or to be recruited by Sin3a, and clarify the mechanism that links H3K27me3 modifications on the nucleosome and 5hmC on the DNA in ESCs. These findings highlight the mechanistic link between PRC2 and Tet1 and contribute to our understanding of how these two epigenetic modifiers regulate the chromatin state of bivalent genes to maintain these bivalent genes in a poised state, ensuring their dynamic regulation during differentiation."

In many cases including cancer, however, it is hard to isolate pure disease tissue, and the impurity hinders accurate mutation analysis by disrupting overall allele frequencies. Here, we propose a new method, Virmid, that explicitly determines the level of impurity in the sample, and uses it for improved detection of somatic variation. Extensive tests on simulated and real sequencing data from breast cancer and hemimegalencephaly demonstrate the power of our model. A software implementation of our method is available at http://​sourceforge.​net/​projects/​virmid/​., Identifying mutations relevant to a specific phenotype is one of the primary goals in sequence analysis. With the advent of massively parallel sequencing technologies, we can produce an immense amount of genomic information to estimate the landscape of sequence variations. However, the error rates for base-call and read alignment still remain much higher than the empirical frequencies of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and de novo mutations [1]. Many statistical methods have been proposed to strengthen mutation discovery in the presence of confounding errors [2–4]., Finding somatic mutations is one particular type of variant calling, which constitutes an essential step of clinical genotyping. Unlike the procedures used for germ line mutation discovery, the availability of a matched control sample is indispensable. Here, sequence variants that exist in the control sample are used as a basis for measuring individual polymorphisms, while the disease-only mutations are generally regarded as candidate somatic mutations. Traditional approaches call variants from each sample to estimate the sequential differences [5, 6]. But most recent studies that calculated joint probabilities of the disease-control genotype pairs had a higher efficiency in separating true somatic mutations from germ line mutations by considering correlations between two samples [7–9]. With the aid of probabilistic variant calling models, whole genome/exome sequencing data have been used to identify potential de novo mutations in various studies including schizophrenia [10], autism [11], and cancer [12]., However, there are many cases where mutation discovery might be confounded. One big hurdle is the impurity and heterogeneity of the disease sample. For example, gastric and breast cancer tissues usually contain large numbers of stromal cells, which makes the acquisition of a pure cancer sample infeasible [13]. More importantly, there are many cases in which this type of contamination is not only inevitable but dominates the sample constitution. Focal malformation of cortical developments, including focal cortical dysplasia and hemimegalencephaly, is the most common cause of childhood intractable epilepsy and there are disease cells in affected brain regions along with a high proportion of normal cells [14]. A similar problem arises when trying to detect a small amount of target genome mixed in control samples. In organ transplantation, an increased level of circulating cell-free DNAs (approximately 10%) from the donor in the recipient's blood indicates a higher risk of failure [15]. Cell-free DNAs are also found in pregnancy; a small number of fetal DNAs (approximately 13%) are detectable in maternal plasma [16]. In both cases, accurate identification of the target genotypes will provide a basis for a non-invasive and low-cost diagnostic method., Conventional methods for somatic mutation profiling are severely compromised in highly contaminated samples because the abundant short reads originating from control genomes obscure the true allele frequency (AF) at the site of de novo mutations. This usually results in a failure to call the true variants. Two questions arise: (1) how can we estimate the contamination level, defined as the proportion of the control sample in the mixed disease sample? (α, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1) and (2) what is the effective way to use α in SNV calling. A natural approach to estimating α has been adopted by many previous studies [15, 17–20]. For any heterozygous mutation, the B allele frequency (BAF) is expected to be close to 50%. A significant and consistent deviation from this value is indicative of the existence and level of control sample inclusion. We found, however, there are two substantial problems to this approach. First, it needs an initial SNV calling procedure either from sequencing or SNP array data, which takes extra time and cost. Second, and more importantly, the initial mutation call is not representative; a higher BAF is likely to be observed in the selected sites causing an underestimation of α. We will show that the bias is significantly large in highly contaminated samples and describe a way to resolve it. Incorporating the estimated α in the SNV calling model is another important problem. There are only a few studies that consider α or a similar concept in SNV calling [7, 9]. More rigorous and explicit use of α by a tight parameterization in a probabilistic model will improve the accu-racy of final calls., Here we describe a novel probabilistic model Virmid (virtual microdissection for variant calling) which estimates: (1) the sample contamination level (α) and (2) the disease genotypes including somatic mutations (Figure 1). At the core of Virmid lies a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of α and the joint probabilities of control and disease genotypes represented by joint genotype probability matrix G (see Materials and methods), driven from a local distribution of BAF. It does not require any prior SNV calling nor does it attempt to find variants beforehand; we show that this not only saves computation but also greatly improves the accuracy by reducing sampling bias. Our model also accounts for other sources of noise including sequencing error, mapping error, read mapping bias and mappability [21] of the genomic regions for more accurate modeling, as well as the effect of copy number variations. More importantly, the tight coupling of α and G implemented in a single integrated model enables rigorous recalibration of genotype probabilities with the given α. We demonstrate using simulated and real exome sequencing data that Virmid significantly increases overall precision and recall in variant finding. Even in some intractable cases, where the target genome exists in a very small amount (α ≥ 80%) in the sample, Virmid shows a near-robust performance. We expect that this improvement will be useful for many related problems from cancer somatic mutation profiling to contaminant genome identification.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Overall Virmid workflow. (a) Disease/control paired data are used (top) to generate an alignment (BAM) file. The mixed disease sample produces short reads of mixed types (blue and orange rectangles). Somatic mutations, where the control has the reference genotype (AA) and the disease has the non-reference (AB or BB, red dots in the alignment), are hard to detect if there is high contamination due to the significant drop in B allele frequency (BAF). Virmid takes the disease/control paired data and analyzes: (1) the proportion of control cells in the disease sample (α) and (2) the most probable disease genotype for each position that can be used to call somatic mutations. (b) An example BAF drop. Without contamination, the expected BAF is 0.5 and 1.0 for heterozygous and homozygous mutations sites, respectively. When there is control sample contamination, α, mutation alleles are observed only in (1 - α) of the whole reads. So the expected BAF drops to (1 - α)/2 and (1 - α). With an accurate estimate of α, Virmid can detect more true somatic mutations, which would be missed by conventional tools due to insufficient observation of B alleles. BAF, B allele frequency.
                    , The Virmid workflow is shown in Figure 1. The input to Virmid includes short reads sequenced from a pure control sample and a potentially mixed disease sample. As a preprocessing step, the reads are aligned to the reference genome to generate sequence alignments. Second, the alignments are corrected using post-processing tools such as the Genome Analysis Toolkit's (GATK) IndelRealigner [22]. Third, BAF is calculated from the corrected alignments for every nucleotide position. Fourth, initial filters are applied for quality control as well as to reduce sample size. Due to the large size of the usual genomic data, we implemented a multi-tier sampling strategy (see Figure S1 in Additional file 1), which reduces the overall running time and disk usage about seven to tenfold. Finally, two filtered alignment files (in pileup format) from the control and disease samples are prepared as input., The first step for Virmid is to estimate α. Here we use A for the reference allele and B for the non-reference. The set of diploid genotypes is, thus, given by G = {AA, AB, BB}. As α is a global parameter, which affects all positions equally, a small subset of positions is sufficient for the estimation. To obtain robust and unbiased estimates, we use a number of criteria: (1) we use only the positions with no B allele in the controls to maximize the chance of getting true somatic mutations; (2) we eliminate positions with a very high or low coverage suggestive of a copy number variation (CNV); (3) more filters are applied so that the selected positions have mapping and sequencing quality values above a certain threshold and (4) the known mappability [21] of the corresponding reference region has to be above a certain threshold (see Materials and methods for detailed settings in Virmid). Finally, the sites are filtered to remove alleles with BAF lower than a parameter R (0 < R ≤ 1). While this makes the filtered list biased for higher BAF mutations, the explicit parameter value R is incorporated in our model to correct that bias (see Materials and methods)., Virmid estimates α from the sampled sites using an MLE [23] with a gradient descent search and simultaneously estimates the joint genotype probability matrix G, based on the estimated α. The estimated α value and the matrix G are used to call the most likely genotype at every nucleotide position. Finally, somatic mutation filters are applied to reduce the number of false positives (see Materials and methods). The overall pipeline including data preprocessing is implemented as a single Java program. We utilized open source libraries such as SAMtools [2] and Picard [24] to increase the efficiency and compatibility of the program. We also significantly reduced the amount of memory and disk usage by minimizing the generation of temporary files., In this study, we presented a novel probabilistic method for SNV calling, with two significant contributions. First, Virmid can estimate sample composition accurately or the level of contamination of a disease sample without genotyping. This not only saves time and money, but removes the severe estimation biases that come from initial SNV calling. Second, Virmid increases genotyping accuracy, especially somatic mutation profiling, by rigorously integrating the sample composition parameter into the SNV calling model. We showed that Virmid outperformed all recent tools in finding somatic mutations particularly in highly contaminated samples. In applying Virmid to HME disease/normal paired data sets, we discovered previously unknown sample impurity and somatic mutations. Our results suggest that it is important to estimate sample composition for all tumor/normal paired data when the sample purity is questionable and explicitly consider the composition in SNV calling if the sample is highly contaminated (>50%). The robustness of Virmid to high contamination also makes it applicable for identifying mutations in other challenging cases, such as with the low amounts of fetal DNA in maternal plasma."

Although this parasite can be controlled using anthelmintic drugs, resistance against most drugs in common use has become a widespread problem. We provide a draft of the genome and the transcriptomes of all key developmental stages of H. contortus to support biological and biotechnological research areas of this and related parasites., The draft genome of H. contortus is 320 Mb in size and encodes 23,610 protein-coding genes. On a fundamental level, we elucidate transcriptional alterations taking place throughout the life cycle, characterize the parasite's gene silencing machinery, and explore molecules involved in development, reproduction, host-parasite interactions, immunity, and disease. The secretome of H. contortus is particularly rich in peptidases linked to blood-feeding activity and interactions with host tissues, and a diverse array of molecules is involved in complex immune responses. On an applied level, we predict drug targets and identify vaccine molecules., The draft genome and developmental transcriptome of H. contortus provide a major resource to the scientific community for a wide range of genomic, genetic, proteomic, metabolomic, evolutionary, biological, ecological, and epidemiological investigations, and a solid foundation for biotechnological outcomes, including new anthelmintics, vaccines and diagnostic tests. This first draft genome of any strongylid nematode paves the way for a rapid acceleration in our understanding of a wide range of socioeconomically important parasites of one of the largest nematode orders.","","The strongylid nematode Haemonchus contortus (barber's pole worm) is one of the most important parasites of livestock, and represents a large order of nematodes (Strongylida) that infect both animals and humans worldwide [1–3]. H. contortus infects hundreds of millions of sheep and goats globally, and causes deaths and production losses estimated at tens of billions of dollars per annum. This nematode feeds on blood from capillaries in the stomach mucosa, and causes hemorrhagic gastritis, anemia, edema and associated complications, often leading to death of severely affected animals [2]. H. contortus is transmitted orally from contaminated pasture to the host through a complex 3-week life cycle [4]: the eggs are excreted in the host feces, the first-stage larva (L1) develops inside the egg, then hatches (within about 1 day) and molts through to the second-stage (L2) and third-stage (L3) larval stages within approximately 1 week; the infective L3s are then ingested by the host, exsheath, and, after a histotropic phase, develop through the fourth-stage larvae (L4s) to dioecious adults; these two last stages both feed on blood., Only four main drug classes have been available for the treatment of strongylid infections, and resistance against these classes is spreading worldwide [5]. It is thus highly desirable to search for new drug targets encoded in the H. contortus genome. Although vaccines using some native parasite antigens (called H11 or H-gal-GP) can partially prevent haemonchosis in experimental sheep, homologous recombinant molecules have failed to achieve protection [6]. Therefore, current treatment relies predominantly on the use of nematocidal drugs (anthelmintics). Because resistance against the main classes of drugs has become widespread [5], the ongoing design of new compounds, such as monepantel [7], cyclooctadepsipeptides [8], and derquantel-abamectin [9], is required. Discovering new drugs has been challenging, particularly because of the current limited understanding of the biology of H. contortus and how it interacts with its host [2]. Here, we describe a draft genome and developmentally staged transcriptome of H. contortus to substantially improve our understanding of this parasite at the molecular level. This genome provides a major resource to the scientific community for a wide range of genomic, genetic, evolutionary, biological, ecological, and epidemiological investigations, and a solid foundation for the development of new interventions (drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests) against H. contortus and related strongylid nematodes., The genomic and transcriptomic exploration of H. contortus provides new insights into the molecular biology of one of the most important parasites of small ruminants worldwide. This investigation has elucidated transcriptional alterations taking place throughout the life cycle, particularly during the transition from the free-living to the parasitic stages, and has emphasized molecules involved in host-parasite interactions and immune responses. Determining the genome sequence and transcriptomes of H. contortus can accelerate post-genomic explorations of genes and gene products involved in nematode development and reproduction, future proteomic and metabolomic studies, parasite-host interactions, and pathogenesis of disease. The characterization of the RNAi machinery for H. contortus also provides a solid platform for functional genomic work in selected stages of the parasite. Therefore, an integrated systems biology approach should provide novel strategies for parasite intervention via drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic tests. For instance, future work could focus on defining a spectrum of key molecules involved in pathways linked to the development of the nervous system in different stages of H. contortus, and assessing their potential as drug targets. Moreover, exploring unique groups of molecules, such as SCP/TAPS, TTLs, and the complex array of peptidases, and understanding the roles of these molecules in host-parasite interactions is likely to support the design of new interventions., The complexity of the genome of H. contortus very probably relates to substantial sequence heterogeneity in non-coding regions among individual worms in the populations used for sequencing, and possibly even within individual worms. Although it is unclear why there is so much sequence variation in some genomic regions, it seems that this parasite mutates at a very high rate in non-coding regions, which might explain, then to some extent, the parasite's ability to rapidly become resistant to anthelmintics. To date, much research has focused on investigating possible associations between resistant phenotypes and mutations in particular candidate genes. Having available a draft genome of H. contortus now provides a solid foundation for genome-wide studies to identify genetic loci associated with anthelmintic resistance, and to explore their inheritance and mechanisms of drug resistance. Such studies will require an improved understanding of the population biology and genetics of this parasite, and knowledge of how mutations arise and are inherited. We expect drug resistance in H. contortus to be multigenic, and we hypothesize that complex resistance mechanisms operate in this nematode, possibly even involving microRNAs. Clearly, the genome of H. contortus will underpin future research in these and many other areas. Although the present study focused on H. contortus, the findings and the technological approaches used will be applicable to other parasitic nematodes of major animal and human health importance. Importantly, this first draft genome for a strongylid nematode paves the way for a rapid acceleration in our understanding of a wide range of socioeconomically important parasites of one of the largest nematode orders."

Its remarkable propensity to develop resistance threatens the viability of the sheep industry in many regions of the world and provides a cautionary example of the effect of mass drug administration to control parasitic nematodes. Its phylogenetic position makes it particularly well placed for comparison with the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the most economically important parasites of livestock and humans., Here we report the detailed analysis of a draft genome assembly and extensive transcriptomic dataset for H. contortus. This represents the first genome to be published for a strongylid nematode and the most extensive transcriptomic dataset for any parasitic nematode reported to date. We show a general pattern of conservation of genome structure and gene content between H. contortus and C. elegans, but also a dramatic expansion of important parasite gene families. We identify genes involved in parasite-specific pathways such as blood feeding, neurological function, and drug metabolism. In particular, we describe complete gene repertoires for known drug target families, providing the most comprehensive understanding yet of the action of several important anthelmintics. Also, we identify a set of genes enriched in the parasitic stages of the lifecycle and the parasite gut that provide a rich source of vaccine and drug target candidates., The H. contortus genome and transcriptome provide an essential platform for postgenomic research in this and other important strongylid parasites.","","Resistance to broad spectrum anthelmintic drugs is now widespread in parasites of domestic livestock [1, 2] and there are increasing concerns about the sustainability of human parasite control programs using mass administration of the same drugs [3]. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying anthelmintic resistance and to discover new methods of chemical and non-chemical control. However, the genomic and genetic resources required to underpin research in parasitic nematodes are lacking [4–6]. The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model system, but it has clear limitations for the study of parasitic species [7]. Although the need to develop workable parasitic nematode model systems is widely recognized, most human helminth species are not amenable to experimental study. In contrast, Haemonchus contortus, a gastrointestinal parasitic nematode of small ruminants, has a successful track record in anthelmintic resistance [7, 8], drug discovery [9, 10] and vaccine [11–13] research. It is amongst the most experimentally tractable parasites for a number of reasons: adult females are relatively large and produce thousands of eggs per day, allowing the production of large amounts of biological and genetic material, the infective larvae (L3) can be viably cryopreserved, and in vivo studies, including genetic crosses, can be undertaken in the natural host [8]. Its phylogenetic position within the most closely related group of parasites to C. elegans facilitates comparative genomics and heterologous gene expression, allowing functional studies to be performed on H. contortus genes and regulatory elements [4, 14]. As this parasite is a strongylid nematode, research on it is of particular relevance to the most economically significant parasites of grazing ruminants and to the human hookworms [15]. H. contortus itself causes major economic loss in small ruminants worldwide; it is highly pathogenic and unsurpassed in its ability to develop resistance to every anthelmintic used in its control. Notably, these include a number of core drugs used for mass drug administration programs in humans [3]. Anthelmintic resistance in H. contortus and related strongylids now threatens the viability of the sheep industry throughout the world [2]. This represents both a warning and a useful model for the consequences of the widespread intensive use of anthelmintics that are now being used to control human parasites in the developing world [3]., 
                H. contortus has a direct and rapid lifecycle (Figure S1 in Additional file 1); adults reside and mate in the abomasum of the ruminant host, then females produce eggs to be excreted in the feces. The eggs embryonate, develop and hatch as first stage larvae (L1), develop and molt to become second stage larvae (L2), then molt again to become third stage larvae (L3) in the feces. The L3 migrate onto pasture to be ingested by the grazing ruminant host. The L3 shed the retained L2 cuticle (exsheath) in the rumen, travel to the abomasum and develop through to the fourth larval stage (L4) then adults in two to three weeks [16]. As voracious blood-feeders, H. contortus L4 and adults can cause severe hemorrhagic gastritis, hypoproteinemia, anemia and edema, with acute infections resulting in death of the animal host. One adult female can produce up to 10,000 eggs per day [17] and a single animal can harbor thousands of worms. This extremely high fecundity, under conducive host and environmental conditions, can give rise to population explosions and devastating disease outbreaks. Development occurs most rapidly in warm humid conditions, but the L4 stage can undergo arrested development within the host to survive adverse conditions such as prolonged drought or cold winters [18]. This feature of facultative arrested development, aided by movement of domestic livestock and climate change, has ensured the worldwide distribution and success of this parasite even though its evolutionary origins were in sub-Saharan Africa [19]., One striking feature of H. contortus, in common with related nematode species, is the extremely high level of genetic diversity that has been reported in both laboratory and field populations; this is thought to be predominantly a function of its large effective population size [20–22]. Genetic variation may underlie both the parasite's remarkable ability to adapt to different climatic regions and host species [23] and its alarming propensity to develop drug resistance. This high level of genetic polymorphism has also provided a major challenge to genome assembly, necessitating the production of an inbred line from which to prepare DNA template., In this paper, we describe the assembly and annotation of the draft genome of MHco3(ISE).N1, a genetically well characterized inbred H. contortus strain that is susceptible to all major anthelmintic drugs. The most extensive comparative transcriptomic sequencing and analysis yet described for a parasitic nematode was undertaken on representative life-stages and the nematode gut to explore different aspects of nematode biology, evolution and parasitism. This draft genome provides a platform for future research in anthelmintic resistance, drug discovery and vaccine development using H. contortus, currently the most important experimental model for the strongylid nematode group., 
                H. contortus is the one of the most intensively researched parasitic nematode species and is the most established parasite species used in drug discovery, drug mode-of-action and drug resistance research. It is the first strongylid nematode to have its genome sequenced and the analysis presented here provides a first genomic insight into the biology of a gastro-intestinal strongylid and blood feeding parasitic nematode. It confirms the close relationship between H. contortus and C. elegans and provides a platform from which to apply the C. elegans biological knowledge to investigate the biology of this parasite for both basic and applied research. It also highlights specific differences between the species that will be important to inform researchers of those aspects of C. elegans biology that cannot be extrapolated. The genome sequence, gene models, transcriptome datasets and bioinformatic analyses provide a wealth of information on potential new drug and vaccine targets. They will also be an invaluable resource for the application of post-genomic technologies to this and other related strongylid parasites."
"63","DNA methylation: an identity card for brain cells","Ambre Bender, Michael Weber","UMR 7242 Biotechnology and Cell Signaling, University of Strasbourg, CNRS","Michael Weber","michael.weber@unistra.fr","27 August 2013","","Brain, DNA methylation, glial cells, hydroxymethylation, neurons","A recently published study has revealed the genome-wide dynamics of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns at single-base resolution in the human and mouse developing brain., Lister et al. [7] first showed that while global CG methylation (mCG) levels are stable during brain development, the transition from the fetal to the adult cortex is characterized by a striking accumulation of DNA methylation in a non-CG context (that is, mCH, where H = A, C or T). mCH occurs mostly in CA sequences and rapidly accumulates during childhood concomitantly with synaptogenesis. In mice, this coincides with the transient upregulation of Dnmt3A, suggesting a role of this methyltransferase in establishing non-CG methylation., In keeping with previous reports [8], Lister et al. [7] also demonstrated that the cortex acquires 5hmC during postnatal development; 5hmC occurs exclusively in the CG context, indicating that mCH is not susceptible to TET-mediated oxidation in the brain. They identified a small number of megabase-sized regions that are curiously refractory to the acquisition of mCH and 5hmC in the adult cortex, even though they have high levels of mCG. These regions, termed 'mCH deserts', are enriched for large gene clusters and show signs of lower chromatin accessibility. By profiling isolated neurons and glial cells, Lister et al. then showed that mCH accumulates specifically in mature neurons, whereas glial cells retain low levels that resemble those of the fetal brain. In the cortical neurons of adult humans, mCH reaches levels that have never been observed in other mammalian cells and becomes the dominant form of methylation, accounting for approximately 53% of methylated cytosine residues, whereas mCG represents approximately 47%. In addition, the mCH positions throughout the genome are highly conserved between unrelated individuals, suggesting that mCH is the product of a controlled process with possible biological roles. Alternatively, the precise positioning of mCH might reflect the physical constraints of chromatin rather than a conserved, regulated function., Are patterns of CG and CH methylation associated with specific gene functions? To address this question, Lister et al. [7] performed an in-depth analysis of methylation levels in 1 kb bins within and around each gene. One remarkable feature is that cell-type-specific variations in methylation are precisely localized to the bodies of genes. Highly expressed genes involved in neuronal and synaptic function do not acquire intragenic mCH in mature neurons, and are marked by reduced intragenic mCG in neurons compared with glial cells. Conversely, genes associated with glial functions gain high intragenic mCH in mature neurons and are marked by reduced intragenic mCG in glial cells compared with neurons., The inverse relationship observed between intragenic mCH and mRNA abundance suggests a possible role in transcriptional repression. This is surprising because studies in other cell types have uncovered a positive correlation between intragenic DNA methylation and transcription, which suggests that distinct mechanisms of epigenetic regulation may operate in the brain compared with other tissues. Notable differences in gene body methylation were also evident on the X chromosome; Lister et al. [7] identified a subset of genes, in both humans and mice, with greater intragenic mCH levels (but not mCG levels) in female neurons compared with males. Remarkably, these genes correspond to those that escape X-inactivation in females, suggesting that their epigenetic signature could serve as a predictive feature. Indeed, on this basis, seven novel genes that escape X-inactivation were predicted., Lister et al. [7] asked if 5hmC appears at specific genomic sites during postnatal brain development and if it is implicated in developmentally regulated demethylation. The base resolution analysis by TAB-seq revealed that 5hmC in the adult murine frontal cortex is depleted in transcription start sites but accumulates throughout the body of highly transcribed genes, where it inversely correlates with intragenic mCG levels. This confirms recent results obtained by other groups that used different mapping technologies to investigate mouse neuronal cell types [8, 9]. 5hmC is also present at many DNase I hypersensitive sites and enhancer regions in the mouse brain., Recently, the first single-base resolution map of 5hmC in embryonic stem cells revealed that this mark is enriched at active enhancers that undergo activation-coupled CG demethylation [10]. The work by Lister et al. [7] found that this is likely also to be the case in the brain in vivo: a set of enhancers were identified that undergo CG demethylation in the adult brain and are marked by 5hmC in the fetal brain, suggesting that 5hmC marks these poised enhancers for demethylation and activation later in development. To validate this model, Lister et al. [7] investigated CG methylation in the frontal cortex of Tet2-deficient mice and observed a small increase in DNA methylation at enhancers that normally undergo demethylation. The tiny magnitude of this hypermethylation could be explained by a functional redundancy with the other Tet enzymes., In summary, Lister et al. [7] have shown that neurons undergo an extensive epigenetic reconfiguration during postnatal brain development and acquire a peculiar epigenetic marking of DNA characterized by modified cytosine residues in both CG and non-CG contexts. In contrast, glial cells maintain epigenetic profiles that closely resemble those of the fetal brain. The fact that many aspects of this epigenetic pattern are conserved between mouse and humans denotes functional importance, which opens stimulating perspectives for future research. Why do neurons acquire an epigenetic profile of DNA that is so different from other cell types? Is it related to the fact that neurons stop dividing? How do these epigenetic profiles influence gene expression states? And is there additional epigenetic heterogeneity between neuron subtypes?, We can now expect new answers from the study of mouse genetic models, as well as from the identification of proteins that bind to methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosine residues [9]. This will help to tackle the fascinating challenge of understanding how epigenetic marks regulate brain maturation, which in turn has major clinical applications for neurological disorders."

All cellular RNA, including mRNA, is packaged into distinct ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to orchestrate RNA maturation and turnover processes summarized as post-transcriptional gene regulation. The most relevant processes involving mRNAs include pre-mRNA splicing, 5' and 3' end modification, editing, transport, translation and degradation. Among the challenges for decoding post-transcriptional gene regulation is the elucidation of the mRNP composition, which changes as mRNAs mature or are translated. This is a prerequisite for understanding the consequences of dysregulation and/or mutation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and/or their target RNA-binding sites in disease., The human genome encodes 1,500 RBPs, and 600 microRNAs targeting mRNAs [1]. Most RBPs are composed of at least one, but frequently also combinations of multiple distinct RNA-binding domains (RBDs). At least 800 distinct RBDs are known[2]; among the most frequent in humans are the single-stranded-RNA-binding RRM, KH, zf-CCCH and zf-CCHC domains, and the double-stranded-RNA-binding DSRM domain. Recent proteomic analysis consolidated the number of mRBPs to 700 proteins and revealed at least 20 previously unknown RBDs [1, 3]., Following or coinciding with the determination of the composition of mRNPs is the identification of the precise binding site(s) located within the mRNA targets of RBPs and the derivation of the underlying RNA recognition element(s) (RRE(s)). This task is non-trivial considering that RBDs generally recognize short and degenerate sequences of three to eight nucleotides, sometimes involving additional RNA secondary structure. In addition, in vivo binding is modulated by competition with other RBPs for the same or adjacent sites [1]. Since the implementation of high-throughput methods in RNA biology, various protocols for the experimental identification of RBP binding sites have been developed. A recent study by Ray et al. [4] used a single-cycle RNA in vitro selection approach to characterize the binding specificities for 205 recombinant RBPs and, in doing so, has brought us an important step closer to solving the post-transcriptional RBP regulatory code., RREs are traditionally determined by sequence comparison and/or conservational analysis from known RNA targets, and validated by biochemical interaction analysis (such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays, filter binding or surface plasmon resonance). For RBPs with unknown RNA-binding sites, in vitro evolutionary methods (primarily SELEX) that identify high-affinity RNA ligands within pools of randomized sequences have been employed with some success [5]. The RRE is then derived by comparing multiple independently sequenced RNA ligands. Alternatively, various crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods have been introduced that rely on covalent crosslinking of an RBP to its RNA targets in live cells, followed by the isolation of crosslinked RBP-RNA segments (Figure 1) [1, 6]. Coupled with deep sequencing of the crosslinked RNAs, CLIP methods allow for the comprehensive determination of in vivo RNA target sites and their underlying RRE. Until recently, knowledge of RREs was rather scant and experimental binding data from SELEX, CLIP and other methods were available for less than 10% of the known RBPs in humans [1, 6, 7].

                        methods for RRE determination. (a) SELEX and RNAcompete start with the preparation of a diverse DNA sequence pool, which is in vitro transcribed into RNA. The protein of interest is incubated with the random sequence RNA pool, followed by RBP pulldown and recovery of the bound RNA. In SELEX, high-affinity ligands are enriched by several rounds of reverse transcription, (mutagenic) PCR and selection, before sequencing of the RNA ligands. In RNAcompete, the recovered RNA is directly quantified on a microarray, rather than sequenced, and enrichment for each individual sequence over the initial pool is calculated. Enrichment scores, which directly correlate with the binding affinity of the RNA sequence, are used to derive the RRE, which serve as input for computational prediction of in vivo RNA targets. (b) CLIP-based methods use in vivo crosslinking to covalently link RBPs to their RNA targets by UV light. After cell lysis, limited RNase treatment and immunoprecipitation of the RBP, the crosslinked RNA segments are recovered, converted into cDNA libraries and deep sequenced. CLIP methods directly identify in vivo RNA targets and binding sites, and motif finding algorithms are used to deduce the RRE from the crosslinked RNA sequences. dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; HITS-CLIP, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by CLIP; iCLIP, individual-nucleotide resolution CLIP; PAR-CLIP, photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; XL-RBP, crosslinked RBP.
                    , To increase throughput and identify the highest-affinity RREs, Ray et al. [4, 8] introduced a SELEX method termed RNAcompete (Figure 1). In contrast to random sequence pools used in SELEX, which contain up to 1014 different molecules of 20- to 80-nucleotide random sequence flanked by constant primer binding sites, RNAcompete pools were designed to contain only 240,000 different sequences of 30 to 40 nucleotides in length. These RNA sequences were predicted to be only weakly structured, with each possible 9-mer represented at least 16 times in the RNAcompete sequence pool. To prepare this RNA sequence pool, oligodeoxynucleotides printed on a microarray were amplified, transcribed into RNA, and subsequently incubated with a recombinantly expressed, affinity-tagged RBP of interest. The RNA pool was then incubated with 75-fold molar excess over protein to ensure efficient competition between the various sequences during binding, so that at equilibrium the proportion of each sequence bound to the RBP reflected its affinity. The incubated protein was recovered and the enrichment of bound RNAs over the initial pool RNA was quantified on microarrays. In contrast to SELEX, the bound RNA was directly analyzed after the first competitive binding reaction without further cycles of amplification and mutagenesis. The RRE for the protein was inferred by combining the calculated Z- and E-values for each possible 7-mer., In their recent study, Ray et al. [4] applied RNAcompete to determine RREs for a collection of 205 different RBPs distributed across 24 species and representing approximately 60 conserved families of RBPs. The parallel processing of samples using a single method facilitated comparison of the RREs and specificities of various RBPs. Most RBPs were expressed in truncated forms comprising all constituent RBD(s) with 30 to 50 flanking amino acid residues to enhance solubility. The selected RBPs contained at least one of nine well-characterized RBDs (RRM, KH, S1, YTH, Pumilio repeats (PUF), zf-CCCH, zf-CCHC, zf-RanBP and SAM), whereby the majority of RBPs contained multiple RBDs. Approximately 90% of the RBPs tested recognized five to seven nucleotide-long sequence motifs and did not require structured RNA for binding, which is expected based on the inclusion of predominantly single-strand-specific RBDs in this study., For 52 proteins, RNAcompete RREs were compared with RREs previously determined by CLIP or other methods. Of these, 35 were highly similar, 6 matched partially and 11 were dissimilar to RNAcompete RRE. For example, for PUM1/2 or ELAVL1/HuR the RREs agreed perfectly, while for proteins such as FMR1 only one of two established RREs were identified. The discrepancies may mirror technical differences between the methods or differences between in vivo and in vitro specificities of RBPs. Enrichment of an RRE by RNAcompete is dependent on affinity, and for multi-RBD proteins affinities of individual RBDs for RNA can vary by orders of magnitude, and contributions of weaker binding RBDs, which can be detected in in vivo data, may be potentially overlooked. In addition, in vivo, the highest affinity sites may not always be accessible due to competition with other RBPs, the cell-type- and subcellular-compartment-dependent concentration of RBP and RNA targets, modulation of RNA affinities by protein cofactors, and the secondary structure of RNA., Of importance was the validation of the intuitive notion that RBPs with high sequence identity bind to similar RREs. It was found that RBPs with 70% sequence identity have close to identical RREs, and RBPs with 50% identity share related binding specificities. Based on this notion, the authors predicted RREs for a total of 8,056 RBPs in humans and other metazoans, as well as in plants and protists. Specifically, this number amounted to 159 RBPs in human belonging to 62 protein families, of which approximately 90% were putative or experimentally validated mRNA-binding proteins (mRBPs). Estimating that 700 of the 1,500 RBPs are mRNA-binding, this study elucidated RRE motifs for 20% of all human mRBPs, and 53% of proteins containing canonical single-strand RBDs (Figure 2). The results are available as a public database and represent a valuable resource for researchers interested in prediction of RBP binding sites.

                        Summary of human mRBPs characterized by RNAcompete. The left panel shows, categorized by selected domain types, the number of RBPs for which RREs were characterized by RNAcompete (red) or remain to be studied (dark gray). RBD categories are RRM, RRM + other (combination of RRM with KH or zinc finger), KH and other RBDs selected in Ray et al. (zinc finger, PUF, CSD, YTH, S1 and SAM). The right panel shows the fraction of human mRBPs studied by RNAcompete. Of all known/putative mRBPs (n = 717; reviewed by Ascano et al. [1]), 20% were studied by RNAcompete (red, n = 146). Another 18% of mRBPs contain at least one or more of the selected RBDs but remain to be studied (dark gray, n = 127). Sixty-two percent of mRBPs contained RBDs (for example, DSRM, La, PWI, and so on) not studied by RNAcompete (light gray, n = 444).
                    , RNAcompete-derived RREs demonstrated predictive power for anticipating regulatory functions of RBPs [4]. Evolutionary conservation analysis showed that sequence elements containing these RREs were frequently under positive selection pressure in 5' UTRs, coding regions, 3' UTRs and intronic regions flanking alternative exons. The location of conserved RREs correlated well with previously elucidated RBP binding patterns, with a few surprising twists; for example, conserved RREs for several splicing factors were unexpectedly frequent in the 3' UTR of mRNAs. RNA sequencing experiments from diverse cell lines and tissues with different RBP expression levels allowed correlation of RBP levels with predicted target RNA levels or splicing patterns. This analysis confirmed known RBP functions in some cases (ELAVL1/HuR, RBM4), but also hinted at unanticipated roles for others (PUM1/2, RBFOX1). A study of RNA knockdown data confirmed that RBFOX1, a splicing regulator, also had a positive effect on RNA stability of putative targets with predicted RBFOX1 sites in the 3' UTR, confirming previous reports that some RBPs may have multiple functions in post-transcriptional gene regulation., Some of the regulatory effects predicted by the evolutionary conservation analysis of RNAcompete RREs, however, are difficult to reconcile with other available data, such as the implied negative effect of the FMR1 protein on target mRNA levels. An effect of FMR1 on RNA abundance was explicitly ruled out in two recent studies, although FMR1 was shown at the same time to negatively regulate protein abundance of targeted mRNAs [9, 10]. As discussed above, these discrepancies may reflect differences between in vivo and in vitro preferences of multi-RBD proteins, including FMR1. Analysis of CLIP-derived motifs showed that the FMR1 RG-rich region bound WGGA with higher affinity than its KH domains bound ACUK [9]. The RNAcompete motifs GACAAG and ANGGAC more likely reflected contributions of the RG-rich region to binding. The implicit assumption that the highest-affinity RRE also reflects the optimal in vivo RRE may prove inaccurate in some cases, because of varying accessibility of a motif., The systematic analysis and identification of RREs, together with in vivo RNA targets of regulatory proteins, will remain one of the main focuses in post-transcriptional gene regulation research. Ray et al. have compiled the largest catalog of experimentally derived RREs at present and this resource may be used to understand evolutionary relationships between RBPs. It also allows researchers to find putative binding sites for RBPs of interest and gives computational biologists the opportunity to integrate RREs as predictors into statistical learning methods to model, in concert with microRNA binding sites, transcription factor recognition elements and epigenetic marks, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression., To capture the physiological role of RBPs, we still need to dissect the target gene network for each RBP individually in various cellular contexts, and then integrate the knowledge into computational approaches that are able to recapitulate quantitatively the regulatory effects of RBPs. This includes understanding protein and target RNA levels in different cell types and tissues, insights into RRE occupancy, competition among RBPs and accounting for redundancies in protein families or regulatory pathways. Efforts such as SELEX- or CLIP-based methods increase the growing compendium of RREs and contribute to this goal to characterize post-transcriptional regulation in a comprehensive manner."

For example, the annual trend for omics data storage and analysis follows a geometric curve that far outpaces that of the famous Moore's Law for computations, paradoxically yielding a net reduction of omics analytical capacity. Michael Baym (Harvard Medical School, USA) described improvements in sequencing capacity achieved by pioneering 'compressive genomics', which leverages a meta-alignment approach that does not require decompressing redundant consensus sequences and has accelerated search efficiency by an order of magnitude (100% positive predictive value, 99% recall, compared with BLAST). Andrew Smith (University of Southern California, USA) provided an accurate estimation of the maximum number of distinct reads that can be obtained from a DNA library, given the read frequency distribution in limited preliminary sequencing. The estimation matched well with deep-read sequencing distributions from human and chimpanzee samples and can be extended to related biotechnologies such as ChIP-seq. Yaron Orenstein (Tel-Aviv University, Israel) transformed the problem of designing double-stranded DNA probes for protein-binding arrays into a problem of sequence coverage that affords unbiased measurements and more-comprehensive protein binding assessments., Tools for efficient and accurate analysis of newly generated high-throughput data are continuing to be developed. Henry CM Leung (The University of Hong Kong, China) described a de novo RNA-seq assembler, IDBA-tran, designed to remove assembly paths of de Bruijn graphs associated with sequencing errors and for merging paths caused by polymorphisms. The algorithm achieved both better sensitivity (more than 10%) and specificity (more than 5%) in read-data associated with poorly expressed isoforms. Wei Wang (University of California, Los Angeles, USA) presented a post-assembler tool using support vector machines, GeneScissors, to correct misaligned fragments in RNA-seq caused by sequence repeats and errors (more than 88% precision and recall; 54% fewer pseudogenes than from the TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline). Bo Xie (Georgia Institute of Technology, USA) reported on an approach integrating a hidden Markov model and a support-vector machine (SVM) for poly(A)-motif discovery that improved the average error rate, false-negative rate and false-positive rate by 26%, 15% and 35%, respectively, compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Jinbo Xu (Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, USA) presented PhyCamp, an algorithm for improving the accuracy of protein-structure self-contact map predictions from primary sequences; the algorithm exploits various physical constraints in protein structure in evolutionary biology using integer programming after Random Forest modeling. Wyatt Clark (Indiana University, USA) improved our understanding of 'misinformation' and 'remaining uncertainty' information-theoretic measures for protein function prediction methods using gene ontology., Scaling from individual molecular interactions to the underlying regulatory network is a key step in understanding and predicting cellular behavior. In several presentations, integration of multiple sources of data for a single biological story yielded a richer biological story about the regulatory connections involved. Christopher Ng (MIT, USA) demonstrated the mis-regulation of a number of genes in Huntington's disease in relation to DNA methylation. He identified transcriptional regulators, through motif analysis and ChIP-seq, whose binding sites are associated with methylation changes, suggesting new disease mechanisms. Anthony Gitter (Carnegie Mellon University, USA) modeled signaling and regulatory networks using molecular pathways with transcriptional networks to predict the response of interacting genes to invading pathogens and disease progression. Following the same theme of improving inference by combining multiple data types, Andrew Sedgewick (University of Pittsburgh, USA) merged genomic and mRNA expression data from TCGA to augment literature-curated gene and protein interactions., Automated network reconstruction allows for rapid analysis of multiple species data, and verification that inferences are not incomplete is key to obtaining high-confidence predictions. John Pinney (Imperial College London, UK) used network topologies to predict the validity of inferred enzyme annotations, demonstrating that topological descriptors in metabolic networks can provide a useful test of such automated methods. Masaaki Kotera (Kyoto University, Japan) trained a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on known pairs of compounds linked by enzymatic reactions to predict additional potential reactions, allowing him to construct metabolic pathways de novo. Timothy Tickle (Harvard School of Public Heath, USA) inferred metagenomic phylogenies by shotgun sequencing of 16S rRNA to characterize the differential populations of digestive-tract microbiota and relate these changes to inflammatory bowel disease, treatments and the environment (such as smoking and antibiotics). Analyzing many omics data sources coincidently will be a valuable strategy in future research as this approach mitigates the (often significant) noise present in individual experiments and platforms and allows true signals to reinforce each other., The progression from molecular interactions to organism-level phenotypes remains an area of exciting development, with many open avenues of research. New insights into stem cell differentiation were presented by Nicola Bonzanni (VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands), who used a Boolean cis-regulatory network model to study the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. His model illustrated the emergence of a number of intermediate and heterogeneous cell states before termination of the stem cell state and identified the need for external triggers to complete the exit from the stem cell state. Importantly, a key prediction from the model - the negative regulation of the transcription factor Fli1 by Gata1 - was confirmed experimentally, demonstrating the power of such models to generate experimentally testable predictions about transcriptional control. In another approach, the ATARiS method by Aviad Tsherniak (Broad Institute, USA) examines patterns of gene expression across many RNA interference data sets to link genes quantitatively to suppression phenotypes. This systematic approach alleviates common issues of differential and off-target gene suppression in RNA interference studies., As we gain an understanding of the molecular interactions involved in a phenotype, understanding how to manipulate the biology becomes an important next step. For example, Paula Petrone (Hoffmann-La Roche, Switzerland) presented an alternative approach for screening interactions between compounds and the proteome to generate candidate pharmaceuticals automatically. Her method bypasses typical homology approaches in favor of biological functional similarity, allowing the discovery of compounds with different structural properties yet similar biological effects. Philippe Sanseau (GlaxoSmithKline, UK) used genome-wide association studies, together with drug disease indications, to identify potentially novel uses for drugs. Additionally, determining the appropriate treatments for disease extends beyond predicting compound-protein interactions, as the variation of molecular and genetic features between individuals continues to confound efforts to delineate clearly relationships with diseases across large cohorts. We (Yves Lussier and Haiquan Li, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA) presented a novel method - the Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray Expression (FAIME) - for translating the gene expression of each array into pathways and functions that can be used for predicting clinical outcome or response to therapy. The method was able to discriminate clinical samples and predict patient survival with high accuracy, providing human-interpretable classifiers composed of biologic mechanisms. Further refining the granularity at which diseases are considered, Chen-Hsiang Yeang (Academia Sinica, Taiwan) used genetic evolutionary dynamics to study heterogeneity in cancer at the single-cell level. His methods allow computational screening of multiple compounds, facilitating inclusion of the genetic dynamics among subpopulations into treatment plans., The ENCODE project has produced abundant information for biological discovery, which might have as much of an impact on biology and medicine as the original human genome project. Misook Ha (Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Korea) described a probabilistic model for chromatin histone H3K4me3 occupancy based on primary sequence at the single-base-pair level. The method unveiled the genomic DNA preference for H3K4me3 modifications and was consistent with results from ENCODE in enriched H3K4me3 binding regions. Junwen Wang (The University of Hong Kong, China) demonstrated an integrative system for annotation, prioritization and visualization of SNP function. His approach integrated data from a comprehensive number of biological scales - expression quantitative trait loci, microRNA and post-translational modification - into reprioritized scores to detect buried SNPs in genome-wide association study data., Taken together, the ISMB-ECCB research community engages in highly collaborative science and comprises computer scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and biologists who have significantly advanced the field of biology with computational approaches in the post-genome era. With the launch of the first comprehensive ENCODE release, the community is now poised to solve more-challenging modeling problems, discovering the mechanisms within and across multiple biological scales and to translate these solutions to study the variant or aberrant molecular mechanisms underpinning human diseases."

The algorithm is applicable to systems with tens of thousands of genes, while accounting for critical aspects of biological networks, including self-loops, large hubs, and target rearrangements. We validate WaRSwap on a newly inferred regulatory network from Arabidopsis thaliana, and compare outcomes on published Drosophila and human networks. Specifically, sustained input switches are among the few over-represented circuits across this diverse set of eukaryotes., The study of system-wide genetic circuit structure is useful to discover underlying patterns that are difficult to observe by looking at a few individual interactions in isolation. Studies of transcription factor (TF) networks in yeast have shown that even in unicellular organisms, there is a strong connection between overall regulatory architecture and TF dynamics [1–3]. Because additional components, such as non-coding RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNAs), have been shown to play crucial roles in gene regulatory networks of nearly every eukaryote [4–7], it would be desirable to identify and analyze patterns of regulatory architecture, especially patterns that include multiple regulatory entities with a variety of biological behaviors. For example, an early study used human gene-expression data to provide evidence that feed-back and feed-forward circuits involving both TFs and miRNAs are abundant in TF-miRNA interaction networks [8]., One of the most relevant methods for identifying over-represented circuit structures within a larger network is called network motif discovery. This is a well-established statistical method for finding over-represented sub-structures within a larger network, and facilitates analysis of the small understandable components of networks, which are used repeatedly as building blocks for a system. The aim of motif discovery is to compare the frequency of particular sub-structures (such as a three-node feed-forward loop) in a given 'real-world' network with its frequency in randomized networks (Figure 1A). If the sub-structure appears much more often than in these randomized 'background' networks, it is said to be a network motif. Network motif finding algorithms have mainly used edge switching (Figure 1B), a fast and simple randomization method that preserves the exact in-degree (number of directed edges coming in) and out-degree (number of directed edges going out) of every node in a network [9, 10]. However, concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of this method because edge switching can sample uniformly only in the limit of extraordinarily long sampling times, thus questionable results can be generated even for small TF-only networks on the order of several hundred nodes [11, 12]. The problem underlying this difficulty is how to efficiently and uniformly sample a collection of bipartite graphs with source and target nodes of fixed in-degrees and out-degrees. To address this problem, a trade-off between uniformity and speed must be made when moving from near-regular graphs (low-variance degrees) to highly irregular graphs (networks such as those found in eukaryotes with large TF 'hubs' that have nodes of large in-degree or out-degree).

The method determines whether M is observed a significantly large number of times in an original network N, compared with randomized networks RN. If the P-value falls below a small pre-determined value, the subgraph count of M that is observed in original network N is considered to be significant, and therefore M is called a network motif for N. (B) Edge switching is a method for generating randomized networks RN in (A) from an original network N. It operates by repeatedly switching the endpoints of two edges. (Left) The two edges in red are selected for switching (top) and their endpoints are exchanged, resulting in a valid graph (bottom). (Right) An example of a failed edge switch: the two edges in red are selected for switching (top), but the exchange of endpoints (bottom) results in an invalid graph, in this case a graph with a double edge. (C) An example of a low-variance count distribution for a particular subgraph, which indicates that the subgraph is highly significant and therefore a motif. Low-variance count distributions (that is, those with small standard deviations) are one symptom of insufficiently randomized networks RN (A), and can result from edge switching in large multi-layer networks.
                    , An algorithm that can handle arbitrary degree sequences (collections of node degrees, however uneven) was presented in a recent review [13]. This algorithm was more efficient than previous approximations, but was 'far from practical,' even for hundreds of nodes, and no code is available., Two methods are currently available to address the case of near-regular graphs, a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for undirected graphs [14], and a software program called Diaconis Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (DIA-MCIS) [15] which implements a rapid, statistically motivated heuristic based on sequential importance sampling [16]. Because most biological networks contain TF hubs, and therefore do not satisfy the regularity conditions required by these methods, they have not gained popular use within the computational biology community. A software implementation of the edge-switching technique, FANMOD (Fast Network Motif Detection) [17], has been applied to large predicted biological networks in humans to address a system with many genes and regulation of small RNAs [18, 19]. Although some insight has been gained by such efforts, such studies have also reported that even if a large percentage of edges in the predicted biological network (up to 50% [19]) are replaced with falsified edges, the same network motif outcome is obtained. Although this could indicate robust results, it could also strongly suggest that the network motif outcome is an artifact of the sampling method in these networks. Thus, there is clearly a need for evaluation of appropriate methods to handle network motif analysis in such large multi-layer graph structures., These theoretical limitations and concerns about the edge-swapping algorithm have a direct bearing on our understanding and interpretation of the actual important network motifs underlying many biological processes. However, because to date there is a complete absence of fast, publicly available algorithmic implementations that address these challenges, edge switching has remained the practical method of choice., We hypothesized that an algorithm that treats the background graph-generation method in a way that respects the statistical goal of uniform draws, but also incorporates realistic biological network behavior, would reduce or eliminate the problems described above. Based on state-of-the-art methods from the probability literature and current biological knowledge of networks involving both TFs and miRNAs, we designed a new hybrid algorithm, WaRSwap (Weighted-and-Reverse-Swap), which respects uniformity constraints even for graphs with highly uneven in-degree and out-degree distributions (large source and target hubs), and performs efficiently on graphs with tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of edges. We compared WaRSwap with current methods on theoretically motivated test examples, as well as actual TF-miRNA-gene networks generated with a variety of biological constraints (binding stringencies) in a large eukaryotic genome, Arabidopsis thaliana. For a realistic comparison on large graphs approaching genome-scale networks, the Arabidopsis genome was chosen for its low-noise TF and miRNA target prediction characteristics (small intergenic regions, near-complementary miRNA targeting) and large gene set (around 30,000 genes, similar to the number of human genes). We found that the method facilitated discovery of biologically relevant patterns in the gene-circuitry structure and generation of hypotheses in a large genetic system involving both TFs and non-coding RNAs. The arrival of the WaRSwap algorithm is timely, with increasingly available experimental data and interest in other large and complex genetic systems including human cell lines., Our validation of WaRSwap in Arabidopsis identified prevalent autoregulatory gene circuits long associated with developmental patterning. Among the motifs containing both TFs and miRNAs, the miRNA-mediated feed-forward loop was a predominant theme, but our results suggest that this pulse-generating circuit may be specific to tightly regulated TF and miRNA binding. We also identified a gene circuit capable of creating a sustained-input switch for a downstream TF or miRNA that is robustly embedded into the structure of our biological network in Arabidopsis. We compared these outcomes with applications of WaRSwap in published Drosophila and human regulatory networks, and made the striking finding that sustained-input switches are among the few over-represented circuits in these networks as well. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that sub-circuits associated with development are dominant across large multicellular genetic systems because of the need for reliable spatiotemporal pattern formation in complex organisms., The goal of network motif discovery is to identify small over-represented subgraphs within a larger graph structure. This goal is achieved by counting the number of a particular subgraph present in the biological network of interest, and then comparing this number with the distribution of counts for this same subgraph over a number of randomized networks (using a P-value or z-score as an indicator of how extreme the value is compared with the distribution of values from randomized networks; see Figure 1A for a visual illustration). To obtain a meaningful outcome, randomized networks must be produced in a way that 1) samples as uniformly as possible from the set of all obtainable random networks (that is, it does not unjustifiably produce certain random networks more often others), 2) reflects the biological properties of the actual network, and 3) is time-efficient and practical., Edge switching operates by taking the original biological network, selecting two directed edges within that network, and switching their endpoints if possible (Figure 1B), then repeating this 'select two edges and swap endpoints' routine for a defined number of attempts. Network motif discovery using edge switching has been shown to be valuable in bacterial and yeast networks, despite the theoretical caveats of the method. However, because the networks of higher eukaryotes are often larger (tens of thousands of nodes, as opposed to several hundred nodes) and contain multiple layers of regulation (TFs and non-coding RNAs), we discovered that these caveats can impede analyses of these networks., We identified three primary difficulties when applying edge switching, as implemented in FANMOD, on networks of the desired size; in this case, the tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of edges in an Arabidopsis network (Table 1). Using the recommended settings and three-node motif searches, we found an unexpectedly large number of motifs with a high z-score and small P-value, which did not greatly narrow the focus to a much smaller set of subgraphs. This result alone is not worrisome because it is possible that, biologically, all of the motifs are significant. However, upon close inspection of the resulting background histogram of many 'significant' motifs, we found the standard deviation of the number of randomized motifs to be very small (Figure 1C), clearly indicating inadequate sampling. Finally, upon tracing the execution of the algorithm, we discovered a large number of failed switches; that is, an edge swap between two adjacent nodes that results in multiple edges and therefore cannot be performed (Figure 1B). In our networks, an estimated 50% of the motifs discovered with edge switching exhibited the problems above (Table 1), which is the problem our algorithm addresses.Table 1

                      aFor each biological network, there were 2,500 random subgraphs generated using the WaRSwap and FANMOD algorithms.
                  , We hypothesized that these problems were symptomatic of an inadequate exploration of the random graph search space for large networks with highly uneven degree distributions, such as the biological networks typical of multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis is advantageous for graph construction because of its straightforward miRNA target identification and short intergenic regions, which limit the cis-element search space. Despite this, the number of Arabidopsis genes (around 30,000) also far exceeds that of single-cellular organisms, and is similar to the size of the human gene set. Given this large genome size but relatively simple architecture, this system is ideal for methodological development. We designed a new algorithm using high-confidence Arabidopsis networks to test and address the algorithmic requirements of motif finding in large eukaryotic gene networks with multiple layers of regulation., Network motif finding is fundamentally a hypothesis-generation method rather than an endpoint to analysis, and as shown in bacteria and yeast networks [9, 10], it can be a valuable computational tool for biological discovery on a systems-wide scale. However, if network motif discovery is to spur follow-up laboratory explorations in eukaryotic genomes, a practical and statistically sound method, which also respects the biology in these genomes, must be used. We have presented evidence that WaRSwap provides such a method, and shown that it can reveal patterns that would be difficult to ascertain by eye or with the use existing methods that are intended for use in much smaller genomes. This new method allowed us to identify new over-represented genetic sub-circuits that are specifically related to development. The repeated use of network motifs such as the sustained-input (or noise-damping) switch for both TFs and miRNAs supports the idea that these themes help to ensure correct patterning in multicellular organisms. Our study also provides fresh evidence supporting the hypothesis that one role of TF-miRNA interactions within the context of developmental networks is to canalize or buffer gene-expression changes in order to confer a robust spatial plan despite noisy environmental input signals [33]. Overall, the availability of reliable methods such as WaRSwap is expected to spur future studies as large, experimentally supported data sets become available in other genomes."

Therefore, accurately detecting gene fusions and the originating rearrangements is of great importance for personalized cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy. We present a tool, BreakTrans, that systematically maps predicted gene fusions to structural rearrangements. Thus, BreakTrans not only validates both types of predictions, but also provides mechanistic interpretations. BreakTrans effectively validates known fusions and discovers novel events in a breast cancer cell line. Applying BreakTrans to 43 breast cancer samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas identifies 90 genomically validated gene fusions. BreakTrans is available at http://​bioinformatics.​mdanderson.​org/​main/​BreakTrans
              , Many cancers are driven by pathogenic expression of mRNA fusion transcripts produced by genomic structural rearrangements (GSRs) in tumor cells. Classic examples include BCR-ABL1 in chronic myelogenous leukaemia [1], PML-RARa in acute promyelocytic leukemia [2], and TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer [3]. These fusions can arise from not only simple translocations of two distal genomic loci [4] but also complex GSRs that involve multiple distal loci [5–8]. Accurately identifying these pathogenic transcripts and the originating GSRs will have a major impact in personalized cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy [4, 9]., Since 2008, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been applied to identify GSR breakpoints and gene fusions. Many bioinformatics tools such as BreakDancer [10], VariationHunter [11], and CREST [12] have been developed to detect GSRs from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. These tools predict individual genomic breakpoints by searching for clusters of abnormally mapped reads. Although generally useful, they often produce an appreciable number of false positives and false negatives introduced by insufficient coverage, short insert size, misaligned reads, GC content bias, base calling errors, and repeats [13]. Limitation in data quality and the complexity of rearrangements make it a challenging task to infer the structure of complex GSRs (or so-called genome architecture) from predicted individual breakpoints [14, 15]. Meanwhile, many tools such as Tophat-fusion [16], deFuse [17], MapSplice [18], and BreakFusion [19] have been developed to detect gene fusions from whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) data. These tools are algorithmically similar to their genomic counterparts, although they have more emphasis on mapping and ascertaining novel sequence junctions produced by mRNA-splicing and are more robust in modeling the coverage (expression). Again, these tools are associated with various types of false positives and false negatives [20] and often do not have good concordance., When both WGS and WTS data are available, we can compare them to identify GSRs that lead to gene fusions. Because of the technical independency of these two data sources, their comparison can serve as a form of validation. In addition to improving results, mapping fusions to GSRs also elucidates the mechanistic origins of these fusions and their potential clinical values. However, such analysis is complicated by several factors. First, because of mRNA splicing, the genomic breakpoints responsible for a fusion may not be located near the fusion boundaries. Second, a fusion may be produced via multiple genomic breakpoints that join segments from distal regions of the genome. Several types of such complex GSRs have been recently revealed by WGS in various cancer types [5–7, 21, 22]. Third, not all GSRs produce new genes that can be transcribed. The properties (for example, location, type, and strand) of individual GSR breakpoints and the potential of producing valid open reading frames from existing genes need to be accounted for so as to produce biologically meaningful results. Fourth, current NGS data have limited power to accurately determine the genomic architectures of underlying alleles [23]. The technological limitations in resolving repeats and phase and the lack of physical coverage make it difficult to derive correct results., To sufficiently address these challenges, systematic approaches are in demand. Recently, two bioinformatics tools, Comrad [24] and nFuse [25], were developed to address this challenge. Both tools align raw WGS and WTS reads while simultaneously corroborating fusions and GSRs. As an early effort, Comrad only maps a single fusion breakpoint to a single genomic breakpoint through the application of a set of ad hoc rules. As an update, nFuse maps fusion breakpoints to complex GSRs using a graph-theoretic approach. A design advantage of these tools is that they can account for ambiguous read alignment and therefore potentially minimize errors caused by misalignments. However, Comrad was only able to analyze low-path WGS data that have limited power in discovering GSR. Moreover, the self-contained design restricts them from examining hypotheses produced by other well-attested algorithms such as Tophat-fusion, MapSplice, BreakDancer and CREST., To overcome these limitations, a modularly designed tool that focuses on mapping fusions to GSRs without re-performing breakpoint discovery may better serve the analytical demand and utilize existing resources. In this paper, we present such a bioinformatics tool, BreakTrans, that integrates the results of various fusion and GSR prediction algorithms and returns a set of genomically validated fusions with their originating alleles., In this work, we present a novel bioinformatics approach, BreakTrans, that systematically maps detected gene fusions to novel genomic alleles produced by GSRs, thereby validating both sets of hypotheses and providing mechanistic interpretation to validated fusions. Our analysis and experimental validation indicated very high specificity of BreakTrans. The true specificity is likely higher than our estimation (60 to 80%), given the difficulties in performing PCR validation in repetitive regions., Our results indicated that BreakTrans could achieve higher sensitivity through integration of multiple predictors without demonstrably increasing false positive rate. This is particularly important for current practice as individual predictors tend to be conservatively configured to achieve individually low false positive rates at the cost of increasing false negative rates. This phenomenon is particularly evident in our SK-BR-3 analysis, where we observed a large proportion of calls unique to a predictor. Conventional strategies that summarize results based on majority rules have been shown to be helpful in reducing false positives [36]. However, the further loss in sensitivity was usually not characterized. Applying BreakTrans to integrate multiple call sets is clearly a different and more effective strategy, as it integrates additional data. Indeed, the two novel fusions in the SK-BR-3 set were only nominated by deFuse and would have been eliminated if a simple consensus approach were taken. Our modular design allowed users to utilize their favorite predictors and include hypotheses from any source (for example, literature). This feature relieves users from trying to determine the best predictors and post-processing strategies for their data, a non-trivial task., Another contribution of our work is that we proposed a convention (breakpoint string) to represent individual breakpoints and breakpoint graphs, as well as simple or complex alleles that encompass one or more breakpoints. This allows the reporting and communicating of large numbers of complex hypotheses in a concise and accurate way, an important requirement for large-scale sequencing and clinical sequencing efforts [37]. It also relieves researchers from manually piecing together alleles from individual breakpoints, a complex and error-prone task., Our current version does not contain a scoring system to characterize the confidence of output fusions and alleles. This is mainly due to the complexity in integrating heterogeneous predictions from different sources, which are associated with heterogeneous scoring systems and precision. With this version in place, we are actively working on approaches to re-score breakpoints and alleles using a genotype-likelihood framework [13, 36], which will be implemented in a future version of BreakTrans., Although BreakTrans can effectively eliminate false breakpoints by leveraging the independence of WGS and WTS data and the existing knowledge of the human transcriptome, the quality of the results is clearly dependent on the quality of the input. If a large number of false breakpoints were included and true breakpoints excluded, any approach will have difficulty deriving correct answers. Improving breakpoint accuracy itself is a non-trivial task given the complexity of the cancer genome and the limitation of NGS [13]. Therefore, it is important to apply modular design that allows problems and efforts to be distributed. BreakTrans makes it possible to separate the problem of breakpoint integration from that of breakpoint identification. Further improvement in either area will synergistically improve the final results., Similar to other programs, BreakTrans requires sufficient coverage on both genomic and transcriptomic breakpoints to validate an event. Failure to validate an event does not necessarily negate its existence. This is a fundamental problem in analyzing heterogeneous tumor samples that often contain multiple clones of tumor cells [38] - that is, subclonal breakpoints may not receive sufficient coverage from standard bulk sample sequencing. However, as NGS continues evolving and its cost continues reducing, it becomes increasingly feasible to obtain deep coverage on both the genome and the transcriptome of subclonal cell populations [38] or even single cells [39]., We have developed a bioinformatics tool, BreakTrans, that systematically maps gene fusions to GSRs, an application that is important for molecular diagnosis and targeted therapy. Instead of re-performing breakpoint discovery, BreakTrans integrates breakpoint hypotheses from various sources using a novel breakpoint graphic approach. Our examination using the WGS and WTS data from breast cancer cell-line SK-BR-3 indicates that BreakTrans has achieved higher sensitivity and specificity than existing approaches. Applying BreakTrans to the 43 breast cancer samples in TCGA, we have identified a set of 'genomically validated' gene fusions that are promising for further functional study. As sequencing coverage continues to increase, we anticipate wide application of BreakTrans in both research and clinical settings."

While recent studies have focused on regulatory cascades of TFs that govern early development, little is known about how the ultimate effectors of cell differentiation are selected and controlled. We addressed this question during late Drosophila embryogenesis, when the finely tuned expression of the TF Ovo/Shavenbaby (Svb) triggers the morphological differentiation of epidermal trichomes., We defined a sizeable set of genes downstream of Svb and used in vivo assays to delineate 14 enhancers driving their specific expression in trichome cells. Coupling computational modeling to functional dissection, we investigated the regulatory logic of these enhancers. Extending the repertoire of epidermal effectors using genome-wide approaches showed that the regulatory models learned from this first sample are representative of the whole set of trichome enhancers. These enhancers harbor remarkable features with respect to their functional architectures, including a weak or non-existent clustering of Svb binding sites. The in vivo function of each site relies on its intimate context, notably the flanking nucleotides. Two additional cis-regulatory motifs, present in a broad diversity of composition and positioning among trichome enhancers, critically contribute to enhancer activity., Our results show that Svb directly regulates a large set of terminal effectors of the remodeling of epidermal cells. Further, these data reveal that trichome formation is underpinned by unexpectedly diverse modes of regulation, providing fresh insights into the functional architecture of enhancers governing a terminal differentiation program.","","Many studies have established that transcriptional networks control development, through determining specific programs of genome expression [1]. These gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are implemented by transcription factors (TFs) that bind to regulatory DNA sequences, known as enhancers or cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), to control the transcription of nearby genes. Although recruited to target genes via their DNA binding properties [2], TFs recognize only short and often degenerate motifs (reviewed in [3, 4]). Consequently, thousands of putative binding sites (BSs) are scattered throughout the genome, hampering efficient prediction of CRMs [3, 5, 6]. The fine structure of enhancers as well as putative general rule(s) underlying their organization remain, however, poorly understood., Although animals encode hundreds of TFs, only a few of them have been studied in detail to elucidate the regulatory logic of their target enhancers [7, 8]. In Drosophila, current knowledge of enhancer structure mainly comes from works on early development - for example, TFs controlling segmentation and mesoderm specification [9–12]. Within these early acting networks, several studies have shown that the local enrichment for BSs (homotypic or heterotypic clustering) in evolutionarily conserved regions is a general signature of active enhancers [13–15]. Functionally related enhancers (driving similar expression patterns) often share a combination or code of cis-regulatory motifs, together defining a specific program of expression [11, 16–18]. Whether enhancers rely on a constrained organization of cis-regulatory motifs or can accommodate flexibility in their number, composition and positioning is still debated (reviewed in [4, 19, 20]). While several studies have shown that regulatory codes are efficient to predict expression pattern [9, 11, 16], recent large-scale work suggests that developmental enhancers may have a more flexible architecture [10, 20]. However, in-depth analyses of individual enhancers [21–24] have revealed an unexpected level of functional constraint in their intimate architecture. It has been proposed that constrained enhancers could be critical when TFs display limiting concentrations [25] - for example, to accurately integrate gradients [26]. On the other hand, enhancers that do not hold integrative properties might be of simpler architecture [27, 28]. Distinguishing between these possibilities thus requires detailed analyses of the structure and regulatory logic of CRM-TF interactions that occur at late developmental stages., Here, we focus on a GRN that controls cell morphogenesis during terminal differentiation of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. The subset of epidermal cells that express the TF Ovo/Shavenbaby (Svb) [29] undergo localized changes in cell shape leading to the formation of dorsal hairs and ventral denticles, collectively referred to as trichomes [30]. Svb triggers the expression of various classes of cellular effectors in trichome cells. Developmental and genetic analyses have established that trichome formation relies on their collective action, acting together as a developmental module to promote cell shape reorganization [31–33]. The mechanisms underlying the co-expression of Svb-regulated genes in trichome cells remained yet poorly understood. A first level of regulation resides in the activity of Svb itself, which is controlled in a post-translational manner in response to small peptides encoded by the gene polished-rice (pri) [34]. Pri peptides trigger amino-terminal truncation of the Svb protein, switching its activity from a full-length repressor to a cleaved activator [34], therefore providing temporal control to the program of trichome formation [32]. However, little is known concerning how this TF recognizes and selects its target genes. Besides definition of DNA-binding specificity in vitro [35] and the identification of a few targets regulated by Ovo germline-specific isoforms [35, 36], only a single epidermal enhancer dependent on Svb has been identified so far [31]. Thus, whether or not Svb targets genes that are co-expressed in trichome cells and have similar cis-regulatory elements remained an open question., To address this question, we designed a set of computational modeling coupled to experimental approaches to identify and investigate the cis-regulatory logic of Svb-dependent enhancers. By systematic in vivo assays, we first identified a robust set of Svb target effectors, specifically expressed in trichome cells at the time of their morphological differentiation. We then searched for and identified 14 Svb-dependent epidermal enhancers driving their expression in trichome cells and investigated their functional organization. Computational analyses and experimental dissection led to a refinement of the Svb BSs bound in vivo and the identification of two additional motifs required for enhancer activity. Our studies further reveal that the distribution of these cis-regulatory motifs does not follow a stereotypical organization. Coupled to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and microarray profiling, the models built from these fine scale experiments allow efficient genome-wide identification of new enhancers that drive the specific expression of trichome effectors. In summary, our results show that enhancers driving co-expression in cells of a late GRN have variable composition and respective organization of cis-regulatory motifs, extending the idea that co-expressed developmental enhancers can have diverse cis-regulatory architectures [11, 37], including for those mediating terminal stages of cell differentiation., It is well established that the Shavenbaby TF determines trichome fate [29, 32, 52]; however, little was known on the repertoire of its direct target genes and mechanistic insights into the functional organization of trichome enhancers were lacking. Combining functional dissection, computational modeling and genome-wide profiling, we provide here a molecular map of the ultimate repertoire of genes and cis-regulatory elements implementing the network of trichome differentiation."

The role of the epigenetic machinery in such processes has, however, been barely investigated. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a recently re-discovered epigenetic DNA modification that plays an important role in the control of gene expression., In this study, we investigate 5hmC occurrence and genomic distribution in 8 fetal and 7 adult human liver samples in relation to ontogeny and function. LC-MS analysis shows that in the adult liver samples 5hmC comprises up to 1% of the total cytosine content, whereas in all fetal livers it is below 0.125%. Immunohistostaining of liver sections with a polyclonal anti-5hmC antibody shows that 5hmC is detected in most of the hepatocytes. Genome-wide mapping of the distribution of 5hmC in human liver samples by next-generation sequencing shows significant differences between fetal and adult livers. In adult livers, 5hmC occupancy is overrepresented in genes involved in active catabolic and metabolic processes, whereas 5hmC elements which are found in genes exclusively in fetal livers and disappear in the adult state, are more specific to pathways for differentiation and development., Our findings suggest that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine plays an important role in the development and function of the human liver and might be an important determinant for development of liver diseases as well as of the interindividual differences in drug metabolism and toxicity.","","There are substantial interindividual differences in many liver processes, including intermediary metabolism, protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism and the detoxification of drugs and other xenobiotics. With respect to variation in drug metabolism, transport and toxicity, much knowledge has been gained from studies investigating genetic factors responsible for interindividual differences. However, little is known regarding the role of epigenetic factors, such as DNA modifications and their influence on hepatic gene expression, function and interindividual variation [1]., The epigenetic DNA modifications include methylation and hydroxymethylation of cytosine. For many years, 5-methylcytosine (5mC) was believed to be the only epigenetic modification of genomic DNA, often referred to as 'the fifth base' of the genome. Recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) was discovered as a novel epigenetic factor in mammalian DNA that can have a stable effect on gene transcription and has hence been regarded as 'the sixth base' of the genome [2, 3]. 5hmC originates from an enzymatic oxidation of 5mC by TET1, TET2 and TET3 proteins [2, 4], which recognize their substrate 5mC by the amino-terminal CXXC zinc finger domain [5]. This reaction is dependent on Fe2+ as well as α-ketoglutarate; the latter, in turn, is dependent on the activity of either isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1 in the cytosol and peroxisomes or IDH2 and IDH3 in mitochondria [6, 7]. Although other proteins may also have some significance in establishing the presence of genomic 5hmC, the TET and IDH proteins seem to play a very important role as determinants of the global 5hmC content., Hydroxymethylcytosine can serve as an intermediate of active DNA demethylation if further oxidized by TET enzymes to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and then to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), which in turn is removed by thymine-DNA glycosylase. The resulting abasic site is repaired by the base excision repair mechanism, producing unmethylated cytosine [8, 9]. The level of 5fC was found to be extremely low in mouse embryonic stem cells and brain cortex (0.02 to 0.002% from total cytosine) [9, 10]. Despite the recent progress in genome-wide mapping of 5fC in mouse embryonic stem cells, there is still no convincing evidence for its role as an epigenetic modification [11, 12]. In contrast, 5hmC is 10 to 100 times more abundant than 5fC and can stably persist in vivo, thus serving as an epigenetic mark with unique regulatory functions., Several functional differences have been demonstrated between the two DNA modifications 5mC and 5hmC. Firstly, the vast majority of CpG sites throughout the genome (except for those located in CpG islands and shores) are constantly methylated. In contrast, 5hmC can be found at only a relatively small subset of CpG sites. Furthermore, variable methylation correlating with gene expression has been described mostly in the promoter regions, whereas the genomic distribution of 5hmC is biased towards exonic regions. In addition, 5mC is, in most cases, a repressive epigenetic mark, whereas the presence of 5hmC correlates with active gene transcription [13–21]. The latter observation can be explained by the different affinity of 5mC and 5hmC for methylated DNA binding proteins. It was demonstrated that MeCP1, MBD1, MBD2 and MBD4 bind to methylated but not to hydroxymethylated loci [22, 23], whereas MBD3 binds to 5hmC with even higher affinity than it does to 5mC [24]. Moreover, the composition of DNA binding and histone modifying proteins in 5hmC-containing loci can also be very different from that of methylated DNA, thus resulting in different gene expression outcomes [16, 18–20, 25]., Highly variable levels of 5hmC have been detected in many human and mammalian tissues and cell types with characteristic tissue-specific patterns [14]. 5hmC is especially enriched in brain tissue and in embryonic stem cells, where it constitutes up to 1 to 1.3% of the total cytosine content [14, 17, 26–29]. Furthermore, 5hmC has been shown to participate in neurodevelopment and has been associated with pluripotent cell states [30–32]. In cancers, such as prostate, breast, melanoma, glioma and colon carcinoma, the content of 5hmC is significantly decreased compared to normal tissue, is usually associated with decreased TET or IDH expression and, more importantly, can affect the tumor phenotype [7, 14, 33, 34]. With respect to human liver, very little is known about 5hmC distribution and function., In this study we demonstrate that adult human livers contain high levels of 5hmC, which are comparable to those found in the brain tissue. The analysis of genome-wide 5hmC hepatic distribution revealed that 5hmC is particularly enriched in coding regions of actively transcribed genes. In addition, the results show profound differences in both genomic distribution and global 5hmC content between fetal and adult liver samples. These differences were further pronounced by pathway analysis of genes enriched for 5hmC elements, which clearly showed consistency with liver development, thus suggesting that 5hmC may play an important role in hepatic development and function., Our study reports, for the first time, the characteristics of the 5hmC epigenetic modification in fetal and adult human livers. We have quantified the global 5hmC content in fetal and adult human livers by LC-MS and showed significantly higher levels of 5hmC in adult compared to fetal samples, accompanied by a correspondingly higher expression of IDH genes, known 5hmC regulators. Our investigations of the global genomic distribution patterns of 5hmC using NGS categorize this DNA modification as an important mark in hepatic gene expression and development., Until recently, quantification of 5hmC relied on less precise methods, mainly antibody detection techniques, and utilized a very small sample size. For example, Li and Liu [35] reported the 5hmC human liver content to be 0.45% of total DNA (0.09% of total cytosine), whereas Nestor et al. [14] reported values of approximately 0.22% of total cytosines. LC-MS enables sensitive and reliable quantification of 5hmC. Previous studies in murine livers found that 5hmC content quantified by LC-MS was very low (0.05 to 0.07% from the total cytosine) compared to other murine tissues (for example, 0.3 to 0.7% in the central nervous system [26]. Importantly, LC-MS quantification of 5hmC in human liver, to our knowledge, has not been carried out before. Utilizing LC-MS together with a protocol developed to detect both 5mC and 5hmC within the same tissue sample, we were able to quantify the 5mC and 5hmC content in seven adult and eight fetal livers. In contrast to the data reported in mice, our results demonstrate that 5hmC levels in the majority of human adult livers (0.5 to 1% 5hmC) remain comparable to those found in the cerebral cortex (1 to 1.3% 5hmC), the most DNA-hydroxymethylated human tissue identified to date [14, 29]. As adult human livers have notably higher global 5hmC content than murine ones, mice are unlikely to serve as relevant models for the human hepatic hydroxymethylome. Moreover, LC-MS quantification of multiple liver samples also demonstrated that the overall content of both 5mC and 5hmC is variable between the samples., Interestingly, fetal samples showed a significantly lower 5hmC content and very similar levels of total 5mC when compared to adult livers. Drastic differences in 5hmC levels between adult and fetal livers can suggest that DNA hydroxymethylation is an important epigenetic phenomenon for liver development. The observed increase of global 5hmC content in adult compared to fetal livers is interesting because, in the majority of studies, a high 5hmC content has been associated with an embryonic or undifferentiated state of tissues or cells. For example, Ruzov and co-authors [32] report changes of 5hmC abundance in the development of mouse and postulate that 5hmC is enriched in embryonic context compared to adult tissues. Szwagierczak and colleagues [28] showed significantly more 5hmC in undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells than in corresponding embryoid bodies, where the decrease in 5hmC content during differentiation was attributed to decreased expression of TET1. In addition, reprogramming of differentiated cells into induced pluripotent stem cells activates TET enzymes and leads to accumulation of 5hmC, where the link between 5hmC levels and development was explained by the presence of binding sites for pluripotency-associated transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2) in the promoter of TET1 [13, 31]. In contrast to these studies, our data indicate a decrease in the extent of 5hmC modifications from the early embryonic stages to adult liver. Similarly, Hahn and colleagues [36] showed that 5hmC is more abundant in terminally differentiated neurons than in neural progenitor cells, thus suggesting that the global 5hmC content increases with terminal maturation in specific tissues., Our studies revealed that the lower 5hmC content in the fetal livers was accompanied by lower expression of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes, known regulators of 5hmC level. Hence, it is tempting to speculate that the increase of 5hmC in adult samples is due to the developmental increase of IDH enzymes. However, we did not observe any correlation between the individual 5hmC content and the levels of either TET1-3 or IDH1-2 transcripts in individual livers (data not shown), indicating that other factors contribute to the global 5hmC content of human liver. Thus, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the level of TET and/or IDH enzymes can be regulated in a post-transcriptional or post-translational manner, and the developmental burst of 5hmC is controlled by mechanisms other than the increased expression of IDH1 and IDH2 mRNA., The observed abundance of 5hmC in adult livers and its preferential localization in actively transcribed genes suggest that bisulfite sequencing data from adult livers should be considered with caution, as bisulfite conversion does not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC [37]. Hence, specific methods allowing discrimination between these two cytosine modifications become especially important in human liver research., NGS of 5hmC-enriched genomic DNA obtained from fetal and adult liver samples revealed profound differences in the genomic distribution of 5hmC peaks between the cohorts and significant interindividual variation among samples within the groups. Interestingly, the genomic distribution of 5hmC peaks did not occur at random but appeared to be dependent on the genomic context and on the stage of liver ontogeny. In general, 5hmC is relatively under-represented in repetitive sequences and enriched in coding regions of actively transcribed genes (Figure 5a). In addition, 5hmC peaks are even more enriched in CGI shores (and hence frequently overlap with CGIs), which is in agreement with the tendency of 5hmC to occur in regions with increased CpG density (Figure S4 in Additional file 1). These 5hmC distribution patterns are quite consistent with previous reports for mammalian nervous tissue and embryonic stem cells [13–17, 19–21], suggesting a functional role for 5hmC in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, the observed tendency of 5hmC peaks to occur in coding genes and regions with increased CpG density may explain the over-representation of 5hmC blocks on chromosomes 16, 17, 19 and 22 (Figure S2 in Additional file 1). Moreover, the depletion of 5hmC from sex chromosomes as seen here has been observed before in human embryonic stem cells and mouse brain [16, 30]., We found that 5hmC blocks in both fetal and adult livers are strongly enriched in genes encoding miRNAs and depleted within lncRNA genes, thus suggesting a role for 5hmC in the regulation of the expression of miRNA genes (Figure 5a). In addition, the observation of high enrichment of 5hmC in hepatic enhancers suggests that 5hmC could play a role in the regulation of gene expression through distal regulatory elements. Moreover, our results evidently indicate the involvement of 5hmC in the developmental expression of protein-coding genes in human liver. Fetal-only 5hmC blocks (that is, genomic intervals that lose 5hmC during liver development, despite the increasing genomic 5hmC content) are especially enriched within genes annotated as belonging to developmental and differentiation-related processes, whereas in adult livers, de novo acquired 5hmC appears to predominantly reside in genes associated with hepatic metabolism. These data are in line with the observation of Thomson and co-authors [38], who recently described the dynamics of 5hmC and its effect on gene expression in mouse livers. The authors showed that following exposure to phenobarbital, rapid, dynamic and reciprocal changes in the level of 5hmC and 5mC occurred over the promotor regions of the murine genes known to be transcriptionally regulated by phenobarbital. The changes in hydroxymethylation and methylation further coincided with changes in the histone marks H3K4me2, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3, and indicate that cytosine hydroxymethylation may be crucial in the acute transcriptional regulation of specific hepatic genes., Here we provide the evidence that adult human liver DNA contains a high level of 5hmC. The brain is another differentiated human tissue that is highly hydroxymethylated [14, 29]. We compared our hepatic 5hmC data with the available cerebellum dataset, obtained using the same chemical labeling-based method for 5hmC capture as in our study [30]. The results of pathway analysis of 5hmC intervals that are shared between cerebellum and fetal and adult human livers suggest that the presence of specific 5hmC signatures within genes related to sterol metabolism and insulin response could be conserved between various tissues., In this study, we for the first time demonstrate that, in contrast to earlier reports, 5hmC is an abundant epigenetic modification in adult human liver. Our findings on the genomic distribution of 5hmC suggest that this epigenetic mark may be an important determinant of the expression of both protein-coding and miRNA genes in hepatocytes. Furthermore, 5hmC appears to play a significant role in hepatic gene expression changes during liver development. Hence, cytosine hydroxymethylation may be a missing link in the full understanding of the functional as well as the developmental processes of the liver, and also can contribute to interindividual differences in liver function and susceptibility to liver disease. Moreover, our findings suggest the importance of using methods that permit the discrimination between 5mC and 5hmC when investigating the liver epigenome, as the traditional methods based on bisulfite sequencing can cause erroneous conclusions."

, miRNAs are non-coding RNAs, approximately 22 nucleotides long, which have been shown to be crucial post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in metazoans and plants, targeting up to 50% of the protein-coding genes [1, 2]. Most of the research over the past decade has concentrated on elucidating the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in cancer and other diseases, and on the potential clinical applications of this knowledge [1, 3]., However, it is still poorly understood how miRNAs themselves are regulated. This is partly due to the difficulty of predicting promoters from short conserved sequence features without producing a high number of false positives [1, 3–5], and partly due to the heterogeneity of the miRNA biogenesis pathways. Although in the past few years several promoter prediction methods have achieved very good performance when predicting gene promoters using a variety of machine learning techniques [6–8], there has been little progress in the field of miRNA promoters. miRNAs, whether they are located in intergenic regions or embedded within introns of protein-coding genes, are in most cases generated from long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). These transcripts, which can be up to several kilobases long, are then rapidly cleaved in the nucleus by the enzyme Drosha [3]. This presents a technical barrier for large-scale identification of miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs), as they can be located very far away from the mature miRNA and therefore cannot be easily inferred from the genomic location of the mature miRNA. The difficulty of experimentally detecting and consequently annotating miRNA promoters has limited our ability to identify the regulatory circuits that control miRNA expression, and has therefore prevented a comprehensive analysis of intronic miRNA promoter characteristics and usage easily inferred from the genomic location of the mature miRNA., A few studies indicate that intronic miRNAs (that is miRNAs located inside the introns of other genes) are not necessarily co-transcribed with their host gene, which suggests that they might have their own independent intronic promoters [9, 10]. The role of intronic miRNA promoters is largely unknown and this adds another layer of complexity to the transcriptional regulation of miRNAs. In addition, recent studies indicate that several alternative miRNA biogenesis pathways exist, for instance the one giving rise to splicing-derived miRNAs, called mirtrons [11]. Despite this complexity, miRNA TSS identification is a crucial step in understanding miRNA regulation, locating the core promoters, and searching for putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)., Existing miRNA promoter recognition methods can be organized into two categories. Chromatin signature-based methods use histone mark profiles, such as H3K4me3 [12, 13] or nucleosome positioning patterns [9] in specific cell lines to annotate miRNA promoters de novo. Supervised methods trained on protein-coding gene features exploit the evidence that miRNA promoters present the typical characteristics of promoters controlled by RNA Polymerase II [14] to build classification models from protein-coding gene promoters and apply them to distinguish miRNA promoters from non-promoters [10, 15, 16]., Although histone mark-based methods can identify up to 80% of miRNA promoters, they have been designed for specific cell lines [12, 13]. Additionally, due to the nature of ChIP-seq experiments and the nucleosomes themselves, histone mark profiles provide a broader view of gene promoters, rather than a direct readout of promoter activity and usage. As a consequence, chromatin-based methods represent a valuable strategy for detecting intergenic and host gene miRNA promoters, but they might lack the sensitivity required to identify intronic promoters. Concerning the second category of methods, we believe that, although miRNA and protein-coding gene promoters show several similarities, this is mainly true for intergenic miRNAs, as too little is still known about intronic miRNA promoters. For this reason, a supervised method trained on protein-coding genes might not be the optimal choice for identifying miRNA promoters, especially intronic ones. On the other hand, given the limited number of known miRNA TSSs, it does not seem feasible to build a supervised model using miRNA promoter annotation only., In this study we present a novel methodology for annotating miRNA promoters called PROmiRNA. Our model is a semi-supervised classification mixture model and uses the deepCAGE data from several tissues, which was generated by the FANTOM4 project [17], together with sequence features, to distinguish putative miRNA promoters from background noise. We apply PROmiRNA to the human genome, to annotate all alternative miRNA promoters and analyze their regulatory features, especially those that characterize intronic promoters. The semi-supervised approach ensures that a minimal number of initial assumptions are made about the nature of miRNA promoters and their similarities to protein-coding gene promoters, while the use of several deepCAGE libraries ensures a high coverage of the method, allowing us to identify at least one TSS for about 82% of the miRNAs annotated in miRBase [18]. We compare PROmiRNA to the methods from Barski et al. [12] and Ozsolak et al. [9] and we find that up to 82% of the miRNA promoters annotated by these two studies are also discovered by PROmiRNA. In addition, PROmiRNA returns all possible alternative promoters for each miRNA, which are mostly missed by the other two methods. We also found that up to 62% of annotated intragenic miRNAs have their own promoters, independent of the host gene promoter, compared to 30% to 35% reported from previous studies [9, 10]. In the absence of a large set of known miRNA TSSs against which to validate our novel promoters, we compute an indirect measure of the performance of our method based on the overlap of the identified promoters with PolII ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE project. We obtain a precision of 83% and 76% for intergenic and intronic miRNA promoters, respectively. We also find that up to 85% of our newly annotated promoters are significantly enriched in read coverage from RNA-seq experiment data, evidence that supports our predictions. Additionally, we validate the promoters identified by our model with a significant number of existing annotated miRNA TSSs and we are able to experimentally validate the identified promoter for two miRNAs, one of which is a novel intronic promoter for miR-130a which has not previously been described., Recent studies of mammalian promoters suggest that alternative promoters of non-coding transcripts are often located inside introns and can be associated with various disorders including cancer [19]. This might also be the case for intronic miRNA promoters and raises important questions about their functional role, their contribution to miRNA expression versus host gene promoters and their evolution. To the best of our knowledge, these questions remain unanswered and the characteristics of intronic promoters, as well as their mechanisms of regulation and evolution have not been systematically investigated., In this study we attempt to answer these questions and find that intronic promoters convey an additional degree of freedom over intragenic miRNA transcriptional regulation, allowing miRNA expression levels to be modulated in a tissue- and condition-specific manner. We discuss the regulatory features of intronic miRNA promoters, compared to other miRNA promoter classes, and we propose for the first time a model for intronic promoter usage and evolution. PROmiRNA can be used to identify and study miRNA promoters in any other species where either deepCAGE or TSS-seq data are available and can be applied to already annotated mature miRNAs, as well as newly discovered miRNA from sequencing experiments. The source code for PROmiRNA, as well the original data used in this study are free for download [20]., Identifying the exact location of miRNA promoters is the critical first step towards annotating full miRNA primary transcripts, predicting the transcription factors that regulate them and, ultimately, explaining miRNA function in complex regulatory networks. Our study has two main contributions: we introduce a new strategy to annotate miRNA promoters using high-throughput genomic data and we apply it to study the characteristics and activity of intronic miRNA promoters., Our model successfully integrates deepCAGE data with other promoter features to score the potential of candidate regions for being real miRNA TSSs. Despite the transient nature of miRNA primary transcripts, we show that deepCAGE data from several tissues can be used systematically to identify miRNA promoters with high coverage by exploiting the fact that most miRNA primary transcripts are capped, and that miRNA expression patterns, as well as degradation rates, are tissue and condition specific. The high coverage of the method is demonstrated by the fact that we can assign a putative promoter to 82% of annotated miRNAs., A miRNA promoter classification method using high-throughput sequencing data was recently proposed by Chien et al. [16]. However, their model is a supervised approach trained on protein-coding gene features and is based on the assumption that miRNA and protein-coding gene promoters have identical characteristics. Although previous studies have shown that the transcription of miRNA genes is regulated in a similar manner to that of protein coding genes [3], mRNAs and pri-miRNAs follow different post-transcriptional pathways, have different lifetimes and, most likely, different read count distributions in the TSS region. Assuming that read counts, which are a measure of expression at the promoter level, are similar for protein-coding genes and miRNAs might lead to a high number of false positives. In addition, given the small number of validated pri-miRNA TSSs, we claim that a semi-supervised model, which does not include protein-coding gene features in the learning process, is more appropriate for describing miRNA promoters., Our method is able to verify known miRNA TSSs and the remaining identified TSSs are strongly supported by PolII ChIP-seq data, as well as full-length primary transcripts from RNA-seq data. In addition, it compares well with existing chromatin-based methods, confirming most of the annotations reported previously. One potential limitation of our method is that it might not be sensitive enough to detect transient pri-miRNAs whenever the Drosha-processing step happens very quickly and few or no reads can be associated with a pri-miRNA TSS. This limitation could be overcome by chromatin-based methods, which have been successfully used over the past few years to detect active promoters [5]. However, compared to histone modification-based methods, deepCAGE data offers the possibility of identifying all possible alternative promoters, producing a direct readout of promoter activity, and thus aiding in detecting intronic miRNA promoters that are preferentially used in a tissue-specific manner. Compared to previous studies, we found an increased number of miRNAs that are predicted to be regulated by their own independent intronic promoter. This number increased from 30% [9, 10] to 50%, if we consider only those promoters that could be validated by PolII and/or RNA-seq coverage., Previous studies indicate that some unknown proportion of CAGE tags falling within transcripts are re-capped products of spliced long RNAs [36]. Although most of these unusual tags map to internal exons or cross exon-exon junctions, and are therefore excluded by our method, some of them might fall within intergenic or intronic regions upstream of annotated miRNAs. Such re-capping products, if any, can give rise to wrongly classified promoters and might represent one of the reasons for the observed lower precision of PROmiRNA in detecting intergenic and intronic miRNAs compared to host gene promoters., In addition, it is important to stress that it is not yet fully understood how miRNA biogenesis and the splicing process of intragenic transcripts interact with each other. Due to the nature of the data used here, our method can be used to identify the start sites of putative primary transcripts but it does not provide many clues for how and when splicing of primary transcripts or miRNA-containing introns happens. Cross-talk between the splicesome and the Microprocessor complex has been hypothesized in previous studies [22, 23, 37] and here we show that exonic miRNAs, as well as mirtrons, can be transcribed by an independent promoter, suggesting that the relationship between miRNA processing and splicing might be more complex than expected. The splicing-dependent processing of exonic miRNAs, as well as mirtrons, is an interesting possibility but too speculative to be discussed here., While this manuscript was in preparation, new CAGE data from the RIKEN Institute were released by the ENCODE project. We therefore checked our miRNA promoters against the ENCODE-generated CAGE TSSs. The details of this comparison are presented and discussed in Additional file 1. Overall the results indicate that, although almost 100% of our identified miRNA host gene promoters are also annotated in ENCODE, the ability of their model to recover our independent miRNA promoters drops to about 60% and 50% for intergenic and intronic promoters, respectively., Beyond the development of the method, we are also able to identify several unique characteristics of intronic promoters. We performed a large-scale analysis of miRNA promoter features for both intergenic and intragenic miRNAs, and we can identify the unique characteristics that distinguish intronic promoters from host gene and intergenic promoters. This allows us to give a partial explanation of the role of intronic promoters, as well as to relate them to the evolution of different miRNA classes. Our results show that CpG islands are primarily a feature of wider host gene promoters, while intergenic and especially intronic promoters are mainly low CpG promoters. Additionally, intronic promoters are usually narrow (less than 100 bp) and enriched in TATA box elements. Our analysis also shows that intronic promoters tend to be regulated by a different set of transcription factors, compared to intergenic and host gene promoters, and that these factors are enriched in tissue-specific master regulators. This has two implications. First, the genomic features of intronic promoters, that is low CpG content and TFBSs for tissue-specific master regulators, suggest that they are alternative promoters that modulate miRNA expression in a tissue or cellular state-specific manner. This is further confirmed by our analysis of miRNA promoter usage among all the FANTOM4 libraries: intronic promoters are mainly tissue-specific, unlike their host genes, and are used in an alternative manner in complex tissues such as the brain. The second implication is that the differences in regulatory elements between intragenic and host gene promoters point towards a different evolution of the two promoter classes, although additional investigation is needed to fully understand these evolutionary differences., The strong bias for miRNAs to be oriented on the same strand as their host gene might suggest that they are co-regulated. However, previous investigations indicated that several intragenic miRNAs have inconsistent expression patterns with their host genes, and that only a minority of them are co-expressed with the host gene [10]. Here we have observed several instances of poor or negative correlation of matched miRNA and mRNA expression in brain tissue. Although differences in host gene and mature miRNA expression could be due to differential miRNA processing or post-transcriptional regulation [11, 38], we tested the hypothesis that intronic promoters are in part responsible for the host gene-independent expression of miRNAs and they are not just transcriptional noise. We could indeed show that miRNAs with intronic promoters are significantly less positively correlated to their host genes, and that instances of poor correlation can be attributed to the use of intronic promoters. The notion of intronic promoters driving expression of intragenic miRNAs has been hypothesized before, but this is the first time, to our knowledge, that a statistically significant association between expression patterns and intronic promoters has been demonstrated., Finally we show that old miRNAs are unlikely to be co-transcribed with their host gene, and the majority of them have developed an independent intronic promoter. It has been hypothesized that introns are 'hot spots' for the emergence of novel miRNAs, as they are particularly suitable for evolving hairpin structures from already transcribed RNAs. Consistent with this hypothesis, younger miRNAs are more often located in introns than ancient ones [39]. In spite of that fact, we also observe that more than half of the old miRNAs are located inside introns and are significantly depleted in GC content compared to young miRNAs (P = 1.092 × 10-8, Wilcoxon test, two sided), in agreement with previous studies [40]. We speculate that old miRNAs might be functionally important, and therefore modulate the activity of target genes that are crucial for certain biological processes. Our observation fits the evolutionary model proposed by Chen and Rajewsky [41], according to which novel non-conserved miRNAs are initially expressed at low level and in specific tissues, to limit the deleterious effect that they might have on their targets. We hypothesize that once such miRNAs complete what they define as the purging phase of evolution and become old, they acquire a defined and important functional role in regulating some specific targets, therefore developing their own promoter. This would ensure that they are able to perform their function independently of the host gene, which protects them from mutations that might occur in the promoter of the host gene and allows them to remain functional in situations where the host gene is shut down., The systematic discovery and analysis of miRNA promoters presented in this study is another step towards understanding miRNA biogenesis, in particular the transcriptional control of intragenic miRNAs, as well as the way in which a novel miRNA promoter can emerge and evolve to acquire a specialized function."

This was envisioned as a complete, distributed, web-accessible research environment for astronomy with massive and complex data sets, connecting in a user-transparent manner the data assets, computational resources, tools and even literature [3–6]. The concept was embraced by the astronomical community worldwide, with national and regional VOs unified in the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA; http://​ivoa.​net). Similar ideas and frameworks were developed around the same time in other fields, in what is sometimes referred to as the cyberinfrastructure movement [7]., A key idea behind the VO concept is that whereas the individual data repositories remain the responsibility of contributing groups, observatories and space missions (the people best qualified to curate the data), the VO framework assures their interoperability through a set of common standards, formats and protocols, enabled by associated metadata. The individual data holdings can then be registered within the VO framework, documented with the proper metadata, and their access and subsequent analysis by various astronomer clients facilitated by the VO's common standards implemented by each participating data node. Thus, the entire federated data ecosystem was designed to grow, with interactivity kept both manageable and scalable. It enabled easy data sharing and re-use, whether mandated by the funding agencies, or performed by data producers wanting to see their data used., The VO approach also enabled scientists less skilled in programming to explore the data. This was possible because the design of the VO emphasized interoperability, creating standards for data and application programming interface (API) management and implementation. The rigid enforcement by the VO of a structured approach to a universal vocabulary of metadata types in observational space was also an essential step. Today, the astronomy community has an infrastructure that fosters the development of tools to implement complex searches across diverse and disparate data archives. Exploration of the skies using the VO can be performed either locally on your desktop computer, or remotely on, for example, NASA supercomputing resources. The VO's inherent flexibility combined with its strong sense of community ensures its continuing success today as a global big data informatics project., So how do we make the jump from stars to genomes? If you replace telescopes with massively parallel sequencers, photometric filters with molecular assays, image processing pipelines with bioinformatics workflows, and multi-wavelength astronomy with integrative genomics, many of the parallels hold up. Perhaps even more pertinently, both endeavors use reference frames - for sequencing, the chromosomal coordinates within the genome, for astronomy, celestial coordinates on the sky. Thus, as the apex of molecular observations can be thought of as the expression level of a gene or the methylation of a cytosine at their specific genomic locations, in a similar way the result of an astronomical observation could be the absolute flux measured in visible light of a star at a given location, which in all cases is a tuple with a measurement, a location reference and a specific annotation(s). The challenges inherent to genomics include the relatively greater number and types of sequencing systems compared with astronomical observatories, and the recognized potential for technical and biological variation to influence sequencing-based assays, making it even more critical that there is a universal, standardized framework for data sharing and access in genomics. Can the Virtual Observatory still be a viable model for the life sciences?, The essential first step for genomics will involve bringing automated bioinformatic workflows progressively closer to the sequencer itself. Astronomy's equivalent is the dedicated computing hardware and data processing pipelines optimized for a given instrument that make the data analysis-ready in real time. This becomes a critical issue as the data rates continue to explode; for example, the planned radio telescope, Square Kilometer Array (SKA; http://​www.​skatelescope.​org), is anticipated to generate raw data at a rate of approximately 4.2 petabytes/second, immediately processed and reduced to science-grade data products at a rate of approximately 0.5 to 10 petabytes/day. A data stream from a DNA sequencing platform could likewise be processed in real time, immediately deleting the raw sequence reads, generating as the final output the reduced, aligned or assembled data with a substantially diminished data footprint. A major challenge for the young field of genomics is going to be community acceptance of automated bioinformatic workflow components, as there is often a lack of consensus about the best choices for tools such as aligners or variant callers., Assuming this initial processing hurdle can be overcome, the genomic data products could be federated in a manner akin to the VO model, with disparate repositories hosting the reduced, annotated datasets and associated metadata connected into a centralized registry, accessed by means of a common suite of tools. While there have been some encouraging steps towards this goal from the modENCODE consortium [8], using the InterMine data warehousing system [9], they do not fully recapitulate the VO model as all data reside in a single repository. Nevertheless, the modENCODE researchers established that life scientists are indeed capable of joining forces to create this VO-like infrastructure. The modENCODE example, however, falls short of the astronomical community's requirement for global interoperability and imposition of standards for both data and metadata. Such rigidity may be considered excessive or premature for genomics, but is a critical foundation for the development of tools to implement multidimensional searches across diverse genomic data archives. The absence of such a common cyberecosystem in the life sciences is stifling the community's potential productivity., So these are the principal lessons from the astronomers: the genomics community needs to come to agreement on common interoperability standards, allowing data archives and analysis tools to be developed, and to define and adopt metadata standards that provide researchers with the ability both to provenance and to combine individual data sources. How does one encourage the diverse genomics community to coalesce, and what are the conditions needed to foster an atmosphere in which a cyberecosystem can develop?, Astronomy offers a further lesson - appropriate conditions are fostered by funding agencies. An influential National Academy of Sciences report [10] prompted US funding agencies (National Science Foundation and NASA) to embrace the concept of the VO from the outset. For genomics in the USA, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could be reasonably expected to define requirements for responsible use of its funds. We note that this is not without precedent at the NIH: the heavily criticized [11] caBIG program of the National Cancer Institute had original goals of interoperability of cancer data that were exemplary from the perspective of creating a VO-like framework., We believe that the NIH needs to be substantially more active in taking advantage of its position of power, coordinating requests for information from members of the genomics community to guide the design of national cyberinfrastructure based around the proven principles of the VO. They could insist on the structured deposition of all genomics data generated from NIH-funded projects to a federally resourced cyberinfrastructure distributed throughout the USA. This creates the VO-like environment within which what may be described as evolutionarily convergent software development can take place, driven by the research community, following NIH-mandated interoperability standards, with the focused goal of developing more complex tools to enhance knowledge discovery., When the idea of the VO was being developed, the developers took inspiration from the then current model of successfully tackling a problem of coordination of standards, the World Wide Web Consortium. Today, the lessons of the VO should be used to guide the genomics community to meet the challenge of allowing genomics data to be explored to the fullest possible extent. The VO-like outcome of tools generating intuitive visual data representations will expand the analysis of genomics data beyond trained programmers to the biologists and clinicians traditionally unable to perform such explorations independently. With the creation of a cyberecosystem in which evolutionarily convergent software development can take place, the risk of developing dead end software is diminished, the security of highly sensitive sample data is enhanced, and the big data deluge can be stemmed, to the benefit of all."

More recently large initiatives such as the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) are using the C57BL/6N mouse strain to generate null alleles for all mouse genes. Hence both strains are now widely used in mouse genetics studies. Here we perform a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic analysis of the two strains to identify differences that may influence their underlying genetic mechanisms., We undertake genome sequence comparisons of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N to identify SNPs, indels and structural variants, with a focus on identifying all coding variants. We annotate 34 SNPs and 2 indels that distinguish C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N coding sequences, as well as 15 structural variants that overlap a gene. In parallel we assess the comparative phenotypes of the two inbred lines utilizing the EMPReSSslim phenotyping pipeline, a broad based assessment encompassing diverse biological systems. We perform additional secondary phenotyping assessments to explore other phenotype domains and to elaborate phenotype differences identified in the primary assessment. We uncover significant phenotypic differences between the two lines, replicated across multiple centers, in a number of physiological, biochemical and behavioral systems., Comparison of C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N demonstrates a range of phenotypic differences that have the potential to impact upon penetrance and expressivity of mutational effects in these strains. Moreover, the sequence variants we identify provide a set of candidate genes for the phenotypic differences observed between the two strains.","Mouse inbred lines, sequence variation, mouse phenotyping, gene knockout, C57BL/6","The development of a comprehensive mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) mutant resource by the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) [1] is a crucial step in the systematic functional annotation of the mouse genome. To date, ESC mutant lines are available for around 15,000 mouse genes, providing a very significant resource for the generation of mutant mice and their subsequent phenotypic analysis. The IKMC resource is being used by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC), which plans over the next 5 years to generate and carry out broad-based phenotyping on 5.000 mouse mutant lines as the first step towards a comprehensive encyclopedia of mammalian gene function [2]., All IKMC mutant clones have been generated using a C57BL/6N ESC line [1]. Moreover, chimaeras generated from IKMC clones as part of the IMPC program have been bred to C57BL/6N mice, thus maintaining the mutations on an isogenic background. The use of C57BL/6N for these major functional genomics programs brings into perspective the genetic relationship between the C57BL/6N strain and other inbred strains that have been the focus of mouse genetics research in the past. In particular, a considerable number of mouse genetic resources have been developed using the C57BL/6J strain, including a variety of reference populations such as recombinant inbred lines [3, 4], consomics [5], heterogeneous stocks [6] and the Collaborative Cross [7]. Moreover, a large number of spontaneous mutations have been identified on the C57BL/6J background. As a consequence, the C57BL/6J line was the natural choice to provide the first reference sequence of the mouse genome [8, 9]. The significant usage of both the N and J sub-strains throughout the wider biomedical science communities emphasizes the need to understand better the genetic and phenotypic relationships between these two inbred strains, and how they might affect our understanding of genetic mechanisms and phenotype outcomes., The inbred C57BL/6 mouse strain was established at the Jackson Laboratory from the parental strain C57BL at F24 in 1948. In 1951, at F32, it was then passed on to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), leading to the C57BL/6N line. The C57BL/6NTac sub-strain was established at F151, following the transfer of the C57BL/6N line to Taconic Farms in 1991 [10]. Thus, at the current time, C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N have been separated for around 220 generations. Early assessment of the genetic variation between the C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N sub-strains using a panel of 1,427 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci identified only 12 SNPs (0.8%) between the two strains [10], reflecting their close genetic relationship., In 2011, an extensive analysis of genomic variation in 17 inbred strains catalogued an extraordinarily large number of variants, including 56.7 M SNPs, 8.8 M small indels and 0.28 M structural variants (SVs) across both the classic laboratory strains and the wild type-derived lines [11]. In addition, these analyses illustrated the potential to relate sequence variation to aspects of phenotypic variation between mouse strains. Importantly, the analyses provided an insight into the molecular and genetic basis of quantitative traits that distinguish the phenotypic characteristics of inbred strains [11]. Small-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) were found to be more often due to intergenic variation, and are unlikely to be the result of structural variation. By contrast, larger-effect QTL are usually explained by intronic variation. However, for the small proportion of QTL of very large phenotypic effect, there is a significant enrichment of coding variation, with an increasing frequency of SVs and small indels. Although overall, the proportion of SVs within the mouse genome causing major phenotypic effects is small, it is likely that SVs that cause phenotypic change will provide significant insights into gene function [11]. This work emphasizes the utility and importance of cataloguing genomic variation in the mouse and analyzing its contribution to phenotypic effects., In this paper, we focus our analysis on a detailed genomic and phenotypic comparison of the C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J strains, aiming to relate the underlying genomic differences to phenotypic outcome. We expanded and refined the analysis of the genome sequences of the two inbred strains. Importantly, using the new short-read genome sequence of the C57BL/6J generated by the Broad Institute and improved analytical tools, we identified a high-quality set of variants including SNPs, small indels, and SVs that distinguish the C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J strains, with a particular focus on cataloguing variation in coding sequences. Using a combination of experimental methods, we validated all coding variants and SVs generating a significantly higher quality variant dataset than that generated from the 17 Mouse Genomes Project, with a null false-positive rate. In parallel, we undertook a comprehensive phenotypic comparison and examined the relationship between genome variation and phenotypic changes in these two sub-strains., We found that there are significant phenotypic differences between N and J mice covering a number of physiological, biochemical, and neurobehavioral systems. These findings have been replicated across a number of centers, indicating that the differences are robust to environmental variables and are likely to have an influence upon the comparative analysis of mutations in the two backgrounds in most laboratories. The phenotype differences we find between N and J will require careful consideration when comparing the effects of mutations created in the two genetic backgrounds. Although the use of C57BL/6N ESCs has allowed the rapid creation of a valuable genome-wide mutation resource [1], our findings of phenotypic differences between N and J indicates that the analysis of the phenotype data that will emerge from the IKMC resource will require careful interpretation in the context of the considerable legacy of data accumulated for C57BL/6J mutations., The phenotypic differences between N and J can probably be accounted for, at least in part, by variations affecting coding sequences in the two genomes. We catalogued and validated a total of 36 SNPs and small indels affecting coding sequences along with a total of 43 SVs between the two genomes. In total, we identified 51 genes carrying some sequence variant or SV that might affect gene function. A proportion of these variants are likely to have little or no phenotypic consequence, including many missense mutations, and also SVs that do not overlap coding sequence. However, given the pleiotropic nature of most genetic loci and additive and epistatic effects, it seems likely that the catalogued coding variations will account for a considerable proportion of the differing phenotypes between the N and J strains., We proceeded to test this proposition by comparing the phenotypes arising from knockouts of the identified loci with the phenotypes of N and J mice. First, we examined the available Mammalian Phenotype (MP) ontology terms, derived by analysis of mutant (usually knockout) phenotypes, for all the loci carrying an SNP, small indel, or SV between N and J. In so doing we attempted to draw correlations between phenotypes associated with individual variant loci and the phenotype changes seen between N and J. For many of the loci, as might be expected, no mutants have been characterized, and phenotypic annotations (MP terms) are not available. For loci carrying SNPs and small indels, 14 of the 36 loci had available MP terms. For SVs, where the SV overlaps a gene, we found MP terms for 7 out of 15 loci. In all cases, MP terms have been derived from knockout, presumably loss-of-function, mutations. For our analysis, we compared the loss-of-function phenotype found in the homozygous knockout with the phenotypic change between N and J, and identified candidate loci that might underlie the observed phenotype effects. For those loci for which we were able to make a comparison (see below), information on heterozygote phenotypes was not available, and therefore the analysis was confined to homozygotes., There are number of assumptions inherent in this analysis. First, it is not trivial to consider the direction of phenotype effect that will arise from sequence variation between N and J. Although missense SNPs that are private to J or N may represent loss of function variants, this might not always be the case. SVs in the neighborhood of genes might also more often lead to loss-of-function effects, but other indirect effects, for example on gene regulation, might lead to gain of function. Second, knockout mutations have been generated on a variety of genetic backgrounds, often mixed, and this will confound any comparative analysis. Nevertheless, we proceeded to compare the available phenotype terms with the observed phenotype changes documented between N and J, assuming in the model that private variants in N or J are likely to lead to a loss-of-function phenotype of the kind that would be revealed by a knockout mutation., Of the 14 SNP and small indel variant loci with phenotypic annotations, 5 (Crb1, Pdzk1, Pmch, Adcy5, Nlrp12) had MP terms that overlapped with the output of the phenotype tests undertaken by EUMODIC or by secondary phenotyping (Table 3). Crb1 carries the rd8 allele, a 1 bp deletion leading to a premature stop and a truncated protein. CRB1 is essential for external limiting membrane integrity and photoreceptor morphogenesis in the mammalian retina [27]. The Crb1
                rd8
                 allele leads to shortened photoreceptor inner and outer segments 2 weeks after birth, and subsequent photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by regions of retinal hypopigmentation. We observed a very similar phenotype in the N mice, and in addition, using the optokinetic drum, we demonstrated significantly reduced vision in N compared with J mice. Moreover, we found that there were significant differences in the mean numbers of retinal veins and arteries between N and J mice. It has recently been reported that the rd8 allele is confined to the N sub-strain and derived ESCs [22]. For the locus Pdzk1, increased circulating cholesterol levels are reported in the knockout, but we did not observe this phenotype difference between N and J.Table 3

                  , For three of the loci (Pmch, Adcy5, Nlrp12) however, we did find some comparable phenotypic effects., 
                Pmch knockout mice display decreased circulating glucose, abnormal glucose tolerance, and increased oxygen consumption. N mice carry a private missense variant in this gene (isoleucine to threonine), and display increased oxygen consumption, but higher circulating glucose levels and normal glucose tolerance compared with J mice., 
                Adcy5 knockout mice display hypoactivity, impaired coordination, decreased vertical activity, and bradykinesia. N mice carry a private missense variant (valine to methionine) in Adcy5. N mice displayed a number of behavioral changes in open field, reflecting hypoactivity, including distance travelled and number of entries to the center. However, these phenotype outcomes were found by only two of the centers, with a third center finding opposing effects, and no changes being found in a fourth center (see above). Both primary and secondary phenotyping employing the rotarod identified significantly impaired motor coordination in N mice. For both missense variants in Pmch and Adcy5, the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN) predictions indicated that the changes may not have a deleterious effect on protein function [28]., NLRP12 is known to be associated with auto-inflammatory disease in humans [29], and mutations in the NBS and NOD domains can cause periodic fever syndromes. Nlrp12 knockout mice show attenuated inflammatory responses for CHS [30]. J mice carry a private missense variant (arginine to lysine) in Nlrp12 that resides in a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat region of the gene. However, we found that J mice show an increased response to DNFB-induced CHS, suggesting that the Nlpr12 locus is not involved or, alternatively, that the missense mutation is a gain of function. Notably, most species (data not shown) carry a lysine at this position. PROVEAN predictions indicate that this mutation is not damaging to the protein., For SVs with MP terms, three loci (Chl1, Rptor, Nnt) had MP terms that overlapped with the phenotype outputs generated in the EUMODIC pipeline (Table 3). Chl1 knockout mice demonstrate abnormal learning and memory, including abnormal response to a novel object and abnormal spatial working memory. Chl1 carries an intronic long interspersed element (LINE) insertion in J mice. However, N displayed impaired spatial working memory in the Morris water maze test compared with J mice, although it is worth noting that the poor performance of N mice could be explained by reduced vision that would impair their ability to decipher visual reference clues., 
                Rptor knockout mice demonstrate a large number of metabolic phenotypes including increased lean mass and reduced fat mass, improved glucose tolerance and decreased circulating glucose, increased oxygen consumption, and hypoactivity. Rptor carries an insertion (member of transcript retrotransposon (MTA)) in J mice, and these mice were found to have reduced fat mass and increased lean mass (in two of the centers), and decreased circulating glucose. However, a number of phenotypes that we have shown to be different in N and J mice are inconsistent with a loss-of-function mutation at the Rptor locus, including poor glucose tolerance in J mice, and increased oxygen consumption and hypoactivity in N mice., Finally, J mice have been documented as carrying a large deletion at the Nnt locus [18], which is associated with significantly impaired glucose tolerance, and this phenotype was confirmed in our N versus J comparison. It is worth noting that given the expected strong effects of the Nnt locus on glucose tolerance, predicted effects from mutations at other loci on glucose tolerance may be over-ridden, and it is likely that Nnt will be epistatic to other loci. So for example, as we discuss above, whereas Rptor knockout mice showed improved glucose tolerance, we found that in J mice carrying an intronic MTA insertion in the Rptor gene, there is poor glucose tolerance. This may reflect the over-riding effect of the Nnt deletion on glucose regulation, or alternatively that the MTA insertion at Rptor has no effect on gene function., Functional analysis of the genetic mechanisms that underlie phenotypic traits in mouse mutants may be influenced, often profoundly, by genetic variation between individual inbred strains. In this study, we undertook the first analysis to detect and verify sequence variants between the two widely used mouse strains C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J. Using deep sequence data and comprehensive detection methods, we validated 51 coding variants, 34 coding SNPs, 2 indels and 15 SVs, differentiating C57BL/6N and C57BL/6J., At the same time, we carried out a comprehensive phenotypic comparison of the two inbred strains and identified a considerable number of significant phenotype differences. While a direct analysis of the relationship between genomic variants and phenotypes were beyond the scope of this study, we thoroughly examined the landscape of phenotypic differences between the two strains, and where possible, related these to the known functions of the variant genes. The comparative examination of the phenotypic terms associated with knockout mutations and phenotype changes between N and J revealed some concordance and some discordance. These analyses were confounded by several factors, including the genetic background of the knockout mice and assumptions regarding the direction of phenotype effect of the variants discovered between N and J. In addition, for many SNPs and SVs, there may be little or no phenotype effect. However, our findings suggest a number of variants and loci that will merit further investigation by exploring the linkage between variant segregation and phenotype in N/J intercrosses. Moreover, N/J intercrosses would enable the identification of genetic loci underlying the many other phenotype differences between N and J, and allow us to explore the potential functional consequences of coding variation at the majority of loci for which there is as yet no functional annotation."

While our knowledge of the ensemble of proteins that bind individual mRNAs in mammalian cells has been greatly augmented by recent surveys, no systematic study on the non-sequence-specific engagement of native human proteins with various types of nucleic acids has been reported., We designed an experimental approach to achieve broad coverage of the non-sequence-specific RNA and DNA binding space, including methylated cytosine, and tested for interaction potential with the human proteome. We used 25 rationally designed nucleic acid probes in an affinity purification mass spectrometry and bioinformatics workflow to identify proteins from whole cell extracts of three different human cell lines. The proteins were profiled for their binding preferences to the different general types of nucleic acids. The study identified 746 high-confidence direct binders, 139 of which were novel and 237 devoid of previous experimental evidence. We could assign specific affinities for sub-types of nucleic acid probes to 219 distinct proteins and individual domains. The evolutionarily conserved protein YB-1, previously associated with cancer and drug resistance, was shown to bind methylated cytosine preferentially, potentially conferring upon YB-1 an epigenetics-related function., The dataset described here represents a rich resource of experimentally determined nucleic acid-binding proteins, and our methodology has great potential for further exploration of the interface between the protein and nucleic acid realms.","","Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids play a pivotal role in a wide variety of essential biological processes, such as transcription, translation, splicing, or chromatin remodeling, defects in which can cause multiple diseases [1]. Transcription factors that recognize specific DNA motifs constitute only part of the nucleic acid-binding proteins (NABPs), which also include less sequence-specific interactors., The global identification of sequence-specific NABPs has so far been achieved through various approaches, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with either microarrays (ChIP-chip) [2–5] or sequencing technology (ChIP-seq) [6–8] as well as protein-binding microarrays [9] and protein arrays [10]. The rapid development of current proteomic technologies has opened new avenues for performing unbiased proteome-wide investigations of NABPs by affinity purification. An in-depth screen of the yeast chromatin interactome [11] was performed by applying the modified chromatin immunopurification (mChIP) approach [12], revealing several multi-protein chromatin complexes. Other researchers have employed mass spectrometry (MS) approaches to study specific aspects of protein-nucleic acid interactions. For instance, Mann and colleagues [13] demonstrated the power of such techniques by identifying interactors of functional DNA elements. Using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides, DNA sequence-specific-binding proteins and proteins that preferably interact with CpG islands were found. The same group subsequently adapted this method to RNA elements [14]. Recently, mRNA-binding proteins were surveyed by covalent UV crosslinking and affinity purification followed by MS analysis in HeLa cells [15]. This work identified 860 high confidence mRNA-protein interactions including 315 proteins not known before to bind mRNA, thereby illustrating the power of such approaches. The dataset provided new insight into the structural properties of mRNA-binding proteins, such as being enriched for short repetitive amino acid motifs and highly intrinsically disordered., In this study, we present the first large-scale effort to map human NABPs with generic classes of nucleic acids. Using synthetic DNA and RNA oligonucleotides as baits and affinity purification (AP)-MS methods we previously applied to unravel new immune sensors of pathogen-derived nucleic acids [16, 17], we performed pulldown experiments in three cell lines that yielded greater than 10,000 protein-nucleic acid interactions involving more than 900 proteins. Analysis of this rich dataset allowed us to identify 139 new high confidence NABPs, to provide experimental evidence for another 98 proteins whose NABP status had only been inferred computationally, and to determine the significant preferential affinity of 219 NABPs for different subtypes of nucleic acids, thereby complementing existing knowledge greatly. The dataset we obtained provides many entry points for further investigations, which we illustrate by proposing new functions for already characterized as well as uncharacterized proteins and domains. All the interaction data are available to the research community., We have established a first, unbiased nucleic acid-protein interaction screen aimed at identifying NABPs on the basis of systematic and comparable experimental observations not oriented towards sequence-specific nucleic acid affinity. This screen successfully provided the first experimental evidence for 237 NABPs, 139 of which were completely novel, showing that DNA and RNA biology still include large, unexplored regions to be discovered. By exploiting the particular bait design, we could further dissect the broad nucleic acid affinity of 219 proteins into 513 significant preferences for subtypes of nucleic acids (Supplementary Table S5 in Additional file 2). The high quality of the data generated in this study is supported by experimental validation and by several additional analyses, such as characteristic pI distributions for NABPs (Figure 3b) and distinct GO term enrichments for RNA- versus DNA-specific proteins (Figure 3a; Figures S2 and S3 in Additional file 1). The limitations introduced by low sequence complexity oligonucleotide baits devoid of secondary structure were analyzed and found to impact the sensitivity of the analysis but not its quality. We also demonstrated that the sensitivity achieved was comparable with native mRNA-cross-linked protein pulldowns published recently [15]., The proposed method implements a new and integrated experimental and computational procedure. The many new NABPs and nucleic subtype preferences identified show its important discovery potential. Compared to previous methods, it retains full information about the nucleic acid bound. This aspect can be fundamental to untangle direct interactions in situations such as gene transcription where DNA and RNA molecules are physically close and protein complexes might bind both types of nucleic acids. Intersecting proteins we inferred to have strong preferential affinity for DNA (P < 0.01), but not for RNA, with the mRNA interactome from [15] we found: PARP1, XRCC6, XRCC5, SUB1, TFAM, SSBP1, H1F0, HMGB1, HIST1H1C, and HMGB2. These proteins are well known to bind DNA, which is nicely reported in our data (Supplementary Table S5 in Additional file 2), but were confusingly found in mRNA pulldowns, which could result in wrong annotations for uncharacterized proteins., The main contribution of this study is to provide a rich experimental resource to the community to intersect and compare with specialized fields of research. We illustrated this great potential by discussing implications of the identified YB-1 affinity for methylated cytosines (Figure 4c; Figure S4 in Additional file 1) in cancer. Access to previously unknown nucleic acid affinities also allowed us to shed light on the function of uncharacterized domains and proteins, such as the C20orf72 protein, which was confirmed to be AT-DNA-specific in the experimental validations (Figure 4b), or the DUF2465 domain proposed to bind RNA (Figure 6). Mining our data deeper, beyond the rigorous statistical procedure identifying the 513 preferential affinities mentioned above, we could demonstrate that more correct nucleotide composition-specific interaction could be found. To which extent such in vitro-observed nucleic acid-protein interactions remain true in vivo is a natural question to ask, especially since recent reports revealed confounding binding events occurring after cell lysis [46, 47]. A general answer is beyond the scope of this work as it would require a gigantic effort to functionally validate all novel interactions. Nonetheless, the same technology was at the source of fundamental discoveries in innate immunity originating from in vitro analyses subsequently validated in vivo, as illustrated by the finding of AIM2 being the inflammasome DNA-binding component [16] and IFITs being 5' triphosphate RNA binders [17]. The latter was even followed by the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the co-complex [48]. This shows that our data provide a rich repository for experimentally derived nucleic acid-binding proteins supporting the identification of novel protein functions or new substrate affinities., The presented approach can be readily scaled-up by introducing additional baits and/or more sensitive MS to explore deeper nucleic acid interactomes, including in projects where different samples or experimental conditions - for example, drug treatments or viral infection - would be compared. All the protein identifications are released in Supplementary Table S9 in Additional file 4 and have been submitted to IntAct [23] as well (Materials and methods)."
"74","So, you want to sequence a genome...","Derek L Stemple","Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus","Derek L Stemple","ds4@sanger.ac.uk","30 July 2013","","","Any reference for a complex genome is necessarily going to be a compromise. The reference will, in the first instance, only represent one exemplar haploid copy of an arbitrarily selected individual or the fragmented agglomeration of several different individuals. For some species, such as mice, where recombinant inbred lines exist, the task was simple because both copies of the haploid genome are essentially identical. For most species, however, the degree of polymorphism between the two copies of the diploid genome can be high and will confound the assembly. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates of 1 change every 200 bases on average are not uncommon, as we found with zebrafish, but will seriously limit the efficacy of most assembly algorithms. Although it is possible to obtain genomic DNA of a single haplotype for some species, it is rare. If single haplotype genomic DNA is not available, it is important to minimize the number of individuals used as a source of reference genome DNA for generation of the libraries. Ideally, a single individual would be used. For the zebrafish reference genome, most of the genomic libraries used were generated from a collection of different, but related, individuals. Consequently, the physical maps were highly fragmented and contained a large number of haplotypic duplications. Ultimately, we were forced to turn to an alternative strategy to produce an accurate assembly., From the beginning of the zebrafish genome-sequencing project in 2002, genome sequence was made publicly available through the Ensembl genome browser (http://​www.​ensembl.​org/​Danio_​rerio). With each new assembly as the project progressed, inaccuracies were rapidly flagged up by zebrafish researchers from around the world. One major aspect of zebrafish genetic research is the use of very high-resolution genetic mapping data (several hundred to thousands of meioses) to pinpoint the location of mutated genes in the genome in positional cloning studies. The local accuracy of these mapping projects led us to realize that a solution to the genome assembly problem might lie in a genome-wide high-resolution meiotic map. We constructed such a map, now known as SATmap [1], which comprises over 140,000 SNP markers scored over more than 900 meioses and now underpins the reference genome assembly. Indeed, SATmap provides genetic resolution, allowing the accurate ordering and orientation of large insert clones over more than 90% of the genome., The number of meiotic events measured will set the resolution of a meiotic map derived from a fixed pedigree, such as that used to generate SATmap. Alternatively, a similarly useful genetic map can be generated from an arbitrary population of individuals. In the population-based map, however, one needs to set the mapping resolution through a mixture of the number of different individuals analyzed and the average size of linkage-disequilibrium (LD) blocks across the measured population. The human HapMap is a good example of such a population-based LD map (http://​hapmap.​ncbi.​nlm.​nih.​gov/​) and such maps could be generated for essentially any population. For a genome-sequencing project of new species, it is easy and relatively cheap to obtain a deep-coverage short-read assembly using new sequencing technologies. If one obtains an LD map from a select population of that species with an LD block size that is on the same order as the average assembled fragment size, then it may be possible to produce a very accurate assembly very quickly and cheaply by comparison with old-school methods., For LD map construction, it is important to accurately and consistently measure the genotype of each individual from many thousands of locations across the genome. The widespread use of hybridization-based enrichment methods, like those used for whole-exome enrichment to identify causal lesions in rare human genetic diseases, provides a good methodology for rapid genome-wide genotyping across many individuals. For this to work, one would start with a good collection of assembled fragments from the whole-genome short-read sequencing data and, from that, identify unique 'bait' sequences spread evenly across the genome. One could, for example, design baits such that each 100 kb chunk of short read assembly is covered. Then one would generate barcoded libraries from each individual in the population, carry out the enrichment hybridization and sequence the enriched genomic fragments using short-read high-throughput sequencing technology., By analyzing the distribution of common SNPs among the genomic fragments across the individuals in the population, using mapping and variant calling programs such as SAMtools (http://​samtools.​sourceforge.​net/​), the raw genotyping data could be derived to generate a LD map. It would probably be necessary to over-sample the population in pilot studies to select a group of individuals that would have the appropriate SNP rates and LD block sizes. A large genetically diverse population should have a sufficiently small LD block size, and sub-selection from the population could be employed to match the appropriate LD block size with the average assembled fragment size. In general, the generation of an LD map would be appropriate for situations where production of crosses and pedigrees for a meiotic map are difficult, because the effort required to identify the appropriate population of individuals to generate the map may be substantial in these scenarios. Ultimately, the optimal approach may be obviated by new DNA sequencing technologies with the potential to produce very long reads., An ideal sequencing strategy would be to start sequencing at one end of each chromosome and determine the entire sequence in one long contiguous read. There are only a couple of sequencing platforms at present that do not require the amplification of DNA, and none of the existing technologies is capable of such fantastically long reads. There is some promise. Considering just the current high-throughput sequencers, there has been a gradual but fairly steady increase in raw read length, and new library generation methods are allowing contiguity assignments over greater and greater distances. Ultimately the single-molecule and pore-based methods may provide the very long read lengths necessary to accurately assemble complex genomes. One can only hope."

Drugs and microbial pathogens are among the most widespread and insidious causes of microbiota disturbance, but antibiotics deserve special attention, not only because of their pervasive effects on the indigenous human microbiota [1], but because of the threats posed by the growing spread of antibiotic resistance. Genes responsible for antibiotic resistance have been found even in 'pristine' environments [2], such as in soil from a remote Alaskan site, as well as in the human microbiome itself [3]. In fact, the use of antibiotics can promote the mobilization and exchange of resistance genes. Resistance genes are usually carried by mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, transposons and phage. The majority of phage in the human gut as well as those in other mammalian intestinal tracts are probably temperate, and therefore spend much of the time as integrated prophages [4]. It is well established from environmental studies that phage shape bacterial community structure and function via predation and gene transfer [5]. Temperate phage often contain bacterial host genes and spread novel or functionally important genes throughout the host population. Phage-encoded host genes can increase the fitness of the bacterial host, which ultimately improves the fitness of the phage., Many of the factors responsible for human microbial ecosystem disturbance produce conditions of oxidative stress for cells of both host and microbe. For example, many bactericidal antibiotics kill via production of hydroxyl radicals in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [6]. Likewise, pathogens typically induce inflammation and reactive oxygen species in the host, and also tend to compete especially well with commensals under these conditions. Interestingly, horizontal gene transfer occurs preferentially under exactly these conditions. It has been shown that beta-lactam antibiotics trigger the bacterial SOS response, induction of prophage in Staphylococcus aureus and phage-mediated transfer of pathogenicity genes [7]. Similarly, quinolone antibiotics induce Shiga toxin-encoding prophage in mice infected with lysogenic enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, enhanced production of toxin, transfection of E. coli nonlysogens within the gut and greater mortality of the host [8], with supporting data from studies of sick children. Under conditions of gut inflammation associated with salmonellosis, transconjugation of plasmids between Salmonella and E. coli occurs at much higher rates than under normal conditions [9]. Thus, horizontal gene transfer is effected by ecosystem disturbance, and suggests a form of adaptive response., In this context, a recent study by Modi and colleagues in Nature [10] provides new insight into the effect of antibiotics on phage populations in the gut and the role of phage in the spread of antibiotic resistance., Modi et al. treated two groups of mice with either ciprofloxacin or ampicillin, and included untreated mice as controls [10]. Fecal matter from each group was collected after 8 weeks and DNA from purified phage communities was extracted. A total of 210 Mb of community DNA sequence was obtained. Quantitative PCR data indicated that <0.1% of the sequences derived from bacterial contamination. To date, this is the first in vivo study of the impact of antibiotics on the overall population of extracellular phage in the gut., The study revealed an increased representation of phage-encoded genes associated with antibiotic resistance after 8 weeks of exposure to each of the two antibiotics compared with the control groups. One assumes that these resistance genes were present in bacterial genomes, perhaps in prophage, or within extracellular phage, prior to antibiotic treatment. In addition to genes that confer resistance to ciprofloxacin or ampicillin, there was enrichment of genes that confer resistance to other members of these two classes of antibiotics, as well as genes associated with resistance to other classes of antibiotics, providing evidence of co-inheritance of heterologous drug resistance. Antibiotic treatment also led to an enrichment of genes related to metabolic processes that might mediate the killing effects of these drugs (such as oxidative stress), or to beneficial, adaptive responses that might mitigate these effects (such as DNA repair) or enhance glycan degradation and other metabolic capacities of the community [10]. The authors then transfected pools of fecal bacterial isolates from untreated mice with phage purified from the feces of treated mice, and found that the fraction of antibiotic-resistant isolates increased more than it did using phage from untreated mice, thereby demonstrating that the phage-encoded antibiotic resistance genes were functional. An analysis of the inferred interactions between phages and bacterial hosts suggests that antibiotic treatment increases the numbers and kinds of interactions, and hence the genetic potential of individuals and consortia within the bacterial communities., There are some unresolved questions with regard to this study. The increase in phage-encoded host genes might result either from blooms in pre-existing antibiotic-resistant lysogenic bacteria, with subsequent phage induction, packaging of host DNA and release of phage, or from primary induction of resistance-encoding prophage and subsequent phage propagation, or both. To disentangle these different mechanisms, one might sequence the corresponding bacterial host populations, in addition to the phage pools, in order to characterize intrinsic resistance genes, the genomes of integrated phage and relative abundances of the hosts, before and after antibiotic treatment. In addition, the role of other extrachromosomal elements in this setting is unclear. Comprehensive assessments of the microbial cell-associated and cell-free metagenomes before and after treatment would help address the contribution of plasmids and transposable elements to the response to disturbance and ecosystem adaptive capacity. From an evolutionary perspective, phage populations confer flexibility and adaptive capacity upon the microbiota; however, in considering the significance of the findings in this study we must bear in mind that the concentrations of antibiotics used here and on humans and other hosts today exceed by many orders of magnitude the concentrations that have been encountered by naturally occurring microbial communities over evolutionary time scales., The findings from the study by Modi et al. lend powerful support to the well-established role of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer within complex naturally occurring microbial communities, and in particular, within the human microbiome. The enrichment of phage-encoded antibiotic resistance genes as well as other beneficial host genes following antibiotic exposure suggests that phage are key factors in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Examination of complete bacterial and phage genomes in control and treated animals, especially humans, would help elucidate the roles of phage in shaping and re-shaping the composition and structure of gut microbial communities before and after various forms of disturbance. Future studies would also benefit from more frequent sampling of individual animals before and after initiation of antibiotic exposure, as well as shorter drug exposures, lower doses, and the use of antibiotics that do not induce phages. These study features would enable a more detailed appreciation of microbial community temporal dynamics, network interactions, community stability and resilience, and variation in these microbiome characteristics among different hosts. The longer term goal of such work is a predictive understanding of ecosystem responses and functions, such that health can be maintained in the face of perturbations and that targeted interventions can be designed to treat or prevent disease-associated community disturbances."

Each of these three display inter-individual variation and thus are candidates for the discovery of variants correlated with quantitative traits. They are therefore currently being explored for associations with diseases, environmental exposures, specific drug interventions, and many other phenotypic effects., One of the major challenges in these rapidly evolving -omics fields is how to integrate datasets in a way that will reveal how the three types of variation inter-relate. As we uncover more details about this network of interactions, we are beginning to discover how disruption of gene expression, DNA methylation or genotype can affect one another on a genome-wide scale. Currently, questions remain as to what extent all three types of variability are inter-dependent, how these relationships vary between cell types and individuals, and how these relationships change throughout an individual's lifetime., A recent article by Dermitzakis and colleagues has taken a step forward in the integration of these disparate types of data by combining data from RNA-seq, SNP genotyping and the Illumina 450K Human DNA Methylation platform to investigate the relationship between gene expression, genotype and CpG methylation [1]. Using samples of three different cell types isolated from the cord blood of 195 newborn infants, they examined concordance between the three types of data to find areas of association. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are correlations between SNPs and gene expression, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) are correlations between SNPs and methylation, and expression quantitative trait methylations (eQTMs) are correlations between gene expression and methylation. The numbers of eQTLs, mQTLs and eQTMs differed between the three tissue types, with mQTLs accounting for the most sites and eQTMs the least [1]. Consistent with previous studies, these associations account for only a small fraction of the assayed CpG sites, SNPs and expressed genes., In keeping with previous reports, the authors found that within a single sample, increased methylation at promoters is associated with decreased gene expression across all genes [1–3]. As was previously published elsewhere, when comparing specific sites across multiple samples, some show the opposite trend: increased gene expression with increased methylation [2]. The authors of this article went one step further, subdividing their sites based on whether they showed a positive or negative correlation between promoter DNA methylation and gene expression across individuals. They found that, regardless of which direction the across-individual correlation was, the across-gene correlation within each individual was always negative. That is, within an individual, analysis of even the positive eQTMs revealed a negative correlation with gene expression., The authors then showed that the CpG sites that were positively correlated with expression across individuals were significantly less likely than their negatively correlated counterparts to be found in CTCF binding sites, enhancers and promoters, particularly non-CpG island promoters [1]. This implies that positive eQTM CpGs are using other mechanisms to influence expression levels., Another interesting finding in this study involved modeling the causative relations of all three types of data. The authors used SNPs as the starting point, since SNPs are the least likely to change over time, and tested whether a SNP is more likely to: (1) affect a methyl site that, in turn, affects gene expression levels; (2) affect gene expression levels that, in turn, affects DNA methylation; or (3) affect both gene expression and methylation independently of one another. Surprisingly, in all three tissues, it is more likely that a SNP affects methylation and expression independently, with SNP to expression to methylation being the least likely in all cases [1]. To determine the underlying mechanism by which SNPs affect both of these in an independent manner, they examined transcription factor (TF) expression levels across individuals, assaying whether an increased or decreased presence of TFs affects both methylation and expression. They examined eQTMs that overlapped with known TF binding sites, and found an enrichment of significant associations with TF expression levels [1]. Thus, if a SNP interferes with or alters a TF binding site, it could potentially affect both DNA methylation and gene expression independently., The authors also showed that CpG sites with the greatest methylation differences between tissues were enriched for both mQTLs and eQTMs. This indicates that tissue-variable sites contribute to inter-individual variation as well. It follows that some of these eQTMs are a result of gene expression affecting local DNA methylation, and thus differences in the transcriptome between cell types results in different eQTMs. For mQTLs, though, the relationship is less clear, as this suggests SNP-dependent methylation at a given site is also tissue-dependent., The analysis done in this study yields important insights into how DNA methylation interacts with both genomic variants and gene expression. However, relatively little of the variation in the dataset could be explained by simple models accounting for these three players. In the context of epigenetics, it is also necessary to consider the changes observed during an individual's development, and the influence of the environment upon these changes., It is tempting to speculate on how or whether the interactions between gene expression, DNA methylation and genotype vary over an individual's lifetime. It has recently been shown that there is massive shifting of patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications in the brain during restructuring and learning [4, 5]. It follows that the interactions of methylation with genotype and gene expression might also change during that time for those CpGs that are linked to allelic variation and gene expression. Given the models presented, it is possible, for example, that changes in gene expression with age result in the changes in DNA methylation patterns that we associate with aging. Alternatively, it could also be that aging directly remodels DNA methylation, resulting in changes in gene expression., It has been clearly shown not only that DNA methylation changes over time, but also that genetic variants can affect the rate at which a person's methylome changes with age [5, 6]. It is entirely possible that understanding the mechanisms by which DNA methylation, gene expression and genomic variation interact over the course of a person's life could yield valuable clues to improving human health and opening new avenues of disease prevention. A similar analysis to that performed in the study by Dermitzakis and colleagues expanded to cover a wide range of ages has the potential to unlock many of the mysteries associated with age-related cellular changes., It is also possible that the environment can be integrated into the proposed models as a global modifier of all three sources of variation, given that exposures to environmental factors can alter gene expression levels as well as DNA methylation [7]. One of the questions asked when assaying a correlation between an environmental or social exposure and an epigenetic pattern is whether the pattern is a result of the exposure or whether it is a sign that the exposure has affected something else in the genome. The current work shows that patterns of DNA methylation that are associated with gene expression levels, for example, are more frequently causative of the gene expression change as opposed to being a result of the change for all three tissues. This is an exciting observation for those who study developmental- and environmental-related changes in DNA methylation, as it describes a potential mechanism by which experiences and exposures can influence the epigenome. At the same time, it is important to note that a large proportion of the eQTMs examined were passive DNA methylation patterns established as a result of gene expression changes., The incorporation of numerous complementary methods together in this study is an important milestone in the maturity of the field of epigenetics, signaling that we are able to unite disparate information sources together to identify patterns that would be invisible when investigated through the lens of a single method. Detailed mapping of these passive versus active DNA methylation patterns in different tissues will be an important next step. It will be vital to identify what determines whether methylation is causative of gene expression changes versus merely being an indicator of transcriptional status. In current population epigenetics studies, large numbers of putative gene associations are being identified for such disparate areas as disease, stress, social history and mental health. If we do not know which of the associations are causative of gene expression changes and which are merely passengers, it will be difficult to differentiate between potential biomarkers and druggable gene targets., Another important implication for the field of population epigenetics that comes from this study is that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression levels is not likely to be allele-specific. Thus, 50% methylation and reduced gene expression at a specific site are much more likely to mean that half of the cells collected were methylated and show lower expression than that all the cells are methylated only on a single chromosome with allele-specific expression., It is curious that, in the article under discussion, no mention is made of how many eQTLs, eQTMs and mQTLs overlap between the tissues or even whether specific CpGs are found on the eQTM and mQTL lists. In previous studies examining more than one tissue, some eQTMs did overlap between tissues [8]. It would be very interesting to note how many of each are found in one or more tissues. It could be predicted, for example, that eQTMs found in all three tissues might have a broader function and could be more stable during development. These cross-tissue eQTMs may be stronger targets for mechanistic experiments to determine through which pathways gene expression and DNA methylation are being coordinated. In addition, mQTLs have been shown to vary across ethnic groups, suggesting the possibility of multi-gene interactions controlling polymorphic DNA methylation [8]., Given the interesting data presented in the article, it will be very exciting to apply a similar approach with genome-wide data for histone modifications, and add this layer to the models proposed. It is likely that histone modifications are at the interface between some of the proposed interactions, mediating the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression, for example; adding this layer to the current data will therefore help to further clarify these relationships., In the context of human disease, the current work presents the first evidence for interactions between genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional variants on a genome-wide scale. Studies such as this, integrating the current wealth of genome-wide technologies, are poised to bring us further information on how and whether multiple types of variation are collaborating to modify disease and disease risk. There are currently few published examples of specific variants interacting to affect disease, but one example showed DNA methylation and genotype interacting as partners to affect the risk of rheumatoid arthritis [9]. It will be interesting to see whether some of the unaccounted-for variation in well-studied diseases may be discovered to be an example of these molecular interactions between genotype, gene expression and DNA methylation."

They mostly discussed generic whole-exome sequencing (WES) in severe syndromic cases, and two main filtering strategies for identifying the causal variant(s) were used in those cases: strategies focusing on de novo mutations (not observed in the parents) and strategies on homozygous mutations (in patients from consanguineous families), which have not been reported in public databases and are predicted to be damaging. Using this approach, Lissenka Vissers (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands) and collaborators identified a de novo mutation in the ARID1B gene, in a patient presenting with eczema, short stature, delayed development and intellectual disability. It is known that mutations in this gene cause Coffis-Siris syndrome, a disease with an autosomal recessive inheritance. Furthermore, the same group identified a de novo mutation in the PDHA1 gene, in a patient presenting with microencephaly, feeding problems, severe developmental delay (non-speech), behavior problems, intellectual disability, short stature, hirsutism and paraplegia. It is of note that before WES, the PDHA1 gene had been erroneously reported negative in the patient via Sanger sequencing., Anita Rauch (Zürich University, Switzerland) and collaborators discussed a case presenting with Fraser-syndrome-like clinical features (including kidney and ureter agenesis). Four genes (including 100 exons) can be mutated in this syndrome. The assessment of these genes would have been too expensive and taken too much time using Sanger sequencing. Therefore, they used WES and found, after filters, a truncated variant and a substitution, both located in one of the four known genes: FRAS1. They discussed another patient with intellectual disability, severe short stature and severe microencephaly, and born from consanguineous parents. They found a homozygous mutation of interest in the CRNPJ gene that is known to be mutated in Seckel syndrome. However, the overlap of phenotypes was incomplete. Interestingly, they found another homozygous mutation of interest in the SACS gene and suggested a compound phenotype that would explain all disorders of the patient., Rauch and collaborators also investigated a third case presenting with macrosomia, severe hypotonia, hyperactivity, autistic features and postaxial hexadactyly. They found a de novo frameshift in OFD1 that causes oral-facial-digital syndrome type I when mutated. However, the phenotypes were not overlapping. They subsequently looked for mosaic mutations in a candidate gene (that had just been published): PIK3CA. They successfully identified a mosaic substitution in this gene that was present in 16% of the saliva cells and in 7% of the blood cells., In a concurrent session, Jean-Baptiste Rivière and collaborators (Laboratoire de Génétique Moléculaire, CHU, France) presented a study in which they performed WES in two patients (and their unaffected parents) with short stature, hyperextensibility of joints and/or inguinal hernia, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly and teething delay (SHORT) syndrome. By focusing on de novo mutations of interest, they found two different substitutions in PIK3R1. Subsequently, via Sanger sequencing, they found seven additional carriers of PIK3R1 mutations who presented with SHORT syndrome. Furthermore, they demonstrated the functionality of these mutations using fibroblasts derived from individuals with PIK3R1 mutations. Their findings highlighted the critical role of PIK3R1 in insulin action, and normal growth and development., In the same session, Sian Ellard and collaborators (University of Exeter Medical School, UK) used a combination of genome sequencing and homozygosity mapping analysis in consanguineous pedigrees affected with neonatal diabetes linked to pancreatic agenesis. They found a shared run of homozygosity encompassing the PTF1A gene known to cause pancreatic agenesis when mutated. No mutations were found in the PTF1A gene. However, through genome sequencing in two probands, they identified a substitution located in a highly conserved 400 bp region. Through functional analyses, they showed that this region was actually an enhancer of PTF1A. Four additional mutations and one indel spanning the same region were identified in ten affected families. This study shows the potentially key role of non-coding regions in monogenic disorders., Other NGS success stories in rare disorders were presented at the meeting. However, it is noteworthy that the NGS results were rather disappointing in common diseases and in general populations. A concurrent session, including six oral presentations, was devoted to this topic, but no strong data were presented. However, most of the presenters tackled the problem of statistical power., In the educational session named 'NGS in the clinic', Christian Gilissen (Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands) tackled several challenges in NGS and discussed with the audience what can go wrong in NGS analyses. It was noted that sample quality can have detrimental effects in NGS analyses, affecting the transition:transversion ratio, overlap with public databases, increases in private variants, as well as negative effects on fastQC data. Gilissen also discussed how not sequencing variants can be due to a low coverage, which is determined by the number of reads for a sample, the number of reads that can be aligned to the genome and the number of reads mapping to the exome (enrichment). Of note, some regions do not enrich well, but in good samples 90% of reads can efficiently map to the target. However, there can be specific enrichment problems due to, for instance, GC-rich regions. False-positive variants can also be due to high amounts of sequence errors (even when there is high coverage), a homopolymer stretch, a PCR amplification artifact and strand bias., Gilissen and Yves Moreau (University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) discussed the big challenge in prioritizing variants. After standard filtering against variants that are not present in healthy populations, many potential candidate mutations are often retained and predictive methods to prioritize variants for further validation are needed. The current computational methods take into account biochemical, evolutionary and structural properties of mutations to assess their functional effect. However, most of these methods overpredict the pathogenecity of the mutations. Moreau and collaborators suggested a genomic data fusion methodology (Extasy) that integrates multiple strategies to detect deleteriousness of mutations and prioritizes them in a phenotype-specific manner using diverse genomic sources such as Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and genomes (KEGG) and InterPro., To conclude, although many NGS success stories were reported during this European Society of Human Genetics meeting, these results were only found in monogenic diseases, especially recessive or de novo dominant disorders. NGS data in polygenic diseases have been very disappointing to date, and so it is clear that we still have many challenges to overcome in NGS."

              , In addition to measuring protein levels in circulation, microRNAs (miRNAs) have also been shown to be effective blood-based biomarkers for a wide array of diseases. The field of circulating miRNAs has been rapidly gaining momentum over approximately the last 5 years, beginning with the discovery that miRNAs themselves can be easily detected and quantified in multiple body fluids, including blood. These circulating miRNAs are resistant to RNases and are in fact very stable in an extracellular environment, in which they can be packaged in microvesicles, exosomes or apoptotic bodies. Circulating miRNAs can also be found in ultrastable protein complexes with Argonaute2, which is the key factor involved in miRNA-mediated repression of target genes [3]. It appears that these miRNAs found in exosomes or in protein complexes may be the remnants of dead cells that have already been cleared. Circulating miRNAs have been profiled from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, serum and whole blood, although there has been some disagreement as to whether there are distinct or reproducible populations of miRNAs detected from each of these sources., Nevertheless, quantification of miRNAs found in blood samples has yielded fruitful results for potential early-stage diagnosis of numerous cancers and other pathologies, making them an attractive new class of disease biomarkers. In a collaborative study, miRNome analysis of 454 blood samples from individuals with different cancers or other diseases yielded strongly dysregulated miRNA profiles for all tested diseases. Further, there appeared to be significant correlations between these dysregulated miRNAs and the genomic location of disease-associated genetic variants [4]., Profiling of circulating miRNAs has now been identified as a useful biomarker tool for AD as well. In this issue of Genome Biology, Petra Leidinger and colleagues report their identification of a novel miRNA signature for detecting AD from blood samples [5]. They performed high-throughput Illumina sequencing of all human miRNAs from whole-blood samples of 48 patients afflicted with AD and 22 age-matched healthy controls, and saw 82 upregulated and 58 downregulated mature miRNAs in AD patients. It appeared that at least some of these 140 dysregulated miRNAs cluster together within a localized genome region, implicating a possible shared regulatory mechanism of miRNA expression., The most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs had already been described in relation to various diseases and thus did not appear to be specific for AD. To differentiate miRNA expression in AD and control samples, the researchers used standard machine learning to yield a 250-miRNA signature with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. However, as many of these miRNAs were strongly correlative with each other, the researchers selected a smaller panel of miRNAs with limited cross-correlation that were also dysregulated in AD patients based on the Illumina sequencing results, but not in many other diseases published in the literature., The next-generation sequencing also detected lowly expressed novel miRNA candidates, which the authors termed brain-miRs. They identified 15 brain-miRs, all of which were upregulated in AD compared with healthy controls. To represent this new class of miRNAs, the researchers selected two brain-miRs to include in their smaller panel. The 12-miRNA panel consists of seven upregulated miRNAs (brain-miR-112, brain-miR-161, hsa-let-7d-3p, hsa-miR-5010-3p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-1285-5p and hsa-miR-151a-3p) and five downregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-532-5p, hsa-miR-26b-5p and hsa-let-7f-5p). While this miRNA signature represents a unique group of miRNAs that has not been identified thus far in its relationship to AD, two of these miRNAs (miR-103 and miR-107) have previously been implicated in the disease, thus increasing confidence in the selection process of this miRNA signature. In a recent study, miR-103 and miR-107 were both shown to reduce expression of their target, ADAM10, which controls the processing of amyloid precursor protein and the formation of amyloid plaques [6]., To validate these differentially expressed miRNAs in a larger cohort, the researchers performed quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of 12 miRNAs in 202 samples from AD patients, healthy controls, and patients afflicted with other neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders. Ten out of the 12 miRNAs were dysregulated in the same direction when comparing next-generation sequencing and qRT-PCR results, showing that the findings from the screen and validation cohort were concordant. Support vector machine classification on the qRT-PCR data reached 93.3% accuracy, as well as high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between AD patients and controls., The expression profile of this 12-miRNA panel was also able to separate AD patients and patients with other neurological disorders, albeit with lower accuracy. As patients with other neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders can sometimes exhibit AD-related symptoms, the authors were curious to see if these patients showed comparable dysregulation in the expression of the miRNA signature. Schizophrenia patients showed a pattern most similar to AD, in which there were six upregulated and six downregulated miRNAs. Patients with other disorders also showed either significant overall upregulation or downregulation of all the 12 miRNAs. Lastly, the authors noted that the AD miRNA signature can distinguish other neurological diseases from the control group using support vector machine classification; surprisingly, the group of psychological disorders was more accurate than AD or the group of neurodegenerative diseases in separation from the control group., Leidinger et al. have shown that identifying dysregulation of miRNA expression in peripheral blood can be a useful biomarker for diagnosis of AD and other neurological disorders [5]. Many studies have investigated the role of miRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases; until this work from Leidinger and colleagues, however, very few reports have analyzed blood-borne miRNA expression profiles in AD patients. Schipper et al. [7] profiled miRNA expression in PBMCs of 16 AD patients and 16 controls, in order to identify miRNAs that may be responsible for targeting mRNAs also shown to be downregulated in AD patients. However, the study found only a very slight increase in expression of nine miRNAs in these patients compared with controls., The identification of targets of significantly dysregulated miRNAs in AD patients remains an important factor for understanding the potential regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in this disease. Leidinger et al. identified 2,354 mRNAs predicted to be targeted by the 10 known miRNAs in the 12-miRNA signature. The authors performed over-representation analysis of these predicted targets and found an enrichment of miRNA targets in Gene Ontology categories of neuron projection development, morphogenesis and other related categories. In fact, many of these predicted targets have already been related to AD or other neurological diseases, including DRD1 (dopamine receptor D1), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), IGF1R (insulin growth factor 1 receptor) and DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1). DISC1 was also a predicted target of a novel miRNA (brain-miR-112) identified from high-throughput sequencing., It should be noted that these genes are only predicted to be targeted by the miRNA panel using bioinformatics; however, a recent study has shed light on analysis of miRNA-mRNA relationships in AD patients. In an effort to simultaneously examine miRNA and mRNA expression in AD patients, Nunez-Iglesias et al. [8] have provided the first joint profile analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs in brain cortex from AD and age-matched controls. By identifying numerous miRNA-mRNA pairs that are altered in AD versus control patients, the data provide a unique resource for studying the relationships between miRNA and mRNA expression in normal and AD brains [8]., Leidinger and colleagues acknowledge that, while this 12-miRNA signature demonstrates impressive accuracy in identifying blood samples from AD patients, this may still not be the most effective diagnostic approach. The authors conclude that a combination of AD-specific miRNA profiles, along with other standard diagnostic tools, may be the best method for diagnosing AD at early stages [5]. Additionally, any direct relationship between AD diagnosis from brain tissue samples or from blood samples remains to be validated, as tissue and blood samples from the same patients were not available for this study. It will be important to show in the future that miRNA profiling from blood or tissue samples will achieve the same AD diagnosis of a patient., This study profiled miRNAs from whole blood; as mentioned earlier, there has been some debate over whether whole blood or isolated plasma or serum fractions should be utilized when performing blood-based biomarker studies. Nevertheless, a serum profiling of AD patients was, in fact, the first study to show that profiling of circulating miRNAs can be a useful AD biomarker, by identifying four downregulated miRNAs in the serum of probable AD patients and risk factor models [9]. Future work could simultaneously compare miRNA profiles in serum, plasma and whole blood in AD patients and controls to identify the most consistent approach for circulating miRNA biomarker studies., Leidinger and colleagues also used their miRNA signature to differentiate between blood samples from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus healthy controls. A recent report has identified two miRNA classes that could also differentiate patients with MCI from controls [10]. Moreover, these miRNA biomarkers successfully detected MCI in a majority of patients in an asymptomatic stage, 1 to 5 years before a clinical diagnosis [10]. The ability to identify MCI in patients could very well delay the onset of AD, as early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases, including development of AD, are associated with MCI."

It integrates specific characteristics of the experiments into a generative model. The model and a novel pattern discovery tool are iteratively applied to data to estimate seed activity probabilities, cluster confidence scores and to assign the most probable microRNA.

              , MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators in all known multicellular organisms. These 20- to 24-nucleotide-long RNA molecules play roles in development, tumorigenesis and viral infection [1]. Generally, they bind to 3' UTRs of their target transcripts inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of the target mRNA [2]. Neither the exact mode of binding nor the mechanisms of downregulation are completely understood and these are being heavily debated [3–7]. It is believed that miRNAs recognize their target sites using only a few bases at their 5' end called the seed [8] and that other factors, such as additional base pairing at the 3' end [2], target site accessibility [9], target site location and AU content around the target site, contribute to recognition [10]. These factors, as well as the evolutionary conservation of target sites (for conserved miRNAs), have been used to predict target sites of miRNAs [11, 12]. However, all known prediction methods are hampered by a huge number of false positives and false negatives [13]. Recently, several high-throughput assays have been developed, which allow accurate identification of miRNA targets (reviewed in Thomson et al. [14])., Immunoprecipitation (IP) of the Argonaute (AGO) protein, the major component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), is used to identify the miRNA-mediated recruitment of hundreds of different transcripts to the RISC. Target mRNAs of miRNAs co-precipitate with AGO and can thus be identified using either microarrays (RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation followed by chip analysis (RIP-Chip)) or next-generation sequencing (RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis (RIP-seq)) [15–20]. However, these RIP experiments only give information about target genes or transcripts and do not give the precise location of target sites nor the actual miRNA targeting these sites. As a result, novel techniques including high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP), individual nucleotide resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) and photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) have been developed. Before the IP, RNA is cross-linked to proteins using UV light, and the precise location of the target site is determined by deep sequencing of cross-linked RNA after digestion of non-cross-linked RNA [21–23]. The actual miRNA binding at these sites still has to be determined., Both techniques, RIP and CLIP, need specialized bioinformatic analysis methods. RIP is very similar to standard gene expression experiments and, thus, advanced analysis methods are readily available. In addition to these standard approaches, in a recent paper, we described additional algorithms that need to be employed to consider and cope with the characteristic features of RIP data [24]. In contrast, CLIP data are more complex: first, short sequencing reads must be aligned to the genome or transcriptome and then clustered [21–23]. True target sites have to be identified in the clusters and the specific miRNA targeting each site has to be determined. Depending on the exact experimental protocol, true target sites may look quite distinctive: for HITS-CLIP, narrow peaks in the read coverage are expected [21], while iCLIP clusters show specific read start positions [22] and PAR-CLIP clusters are characterized by T to C conversions [23]. Here, we focus on PAR-CLIP, a technique that has been used by several groups to identify miRNA target sites [23, 25–27]., In their original PAR-Clip paper, Hafner et al. [23] used several manually chosen parameters to define target sites (for example, at least two distinct conversion positions per cluster and at least five sequencing reads). They recognized that the region downstream of the main conversion site is enriched for sequences complementary to the seeds of the top expressed miRNAs., PARalyzer is a software package specifically designed to define RNA binding sites from PAR-CLIP data. Reads are first clustered and filtered using similar parameters as those used by Hafner et al. [23]. Then, conversion and non-conversion distributions are computed by counting the respective events and employing kernel density estimation along each cluster. All positions with a higher conversion than non-conversion density are considered target sites and surrounding sequences are submitted to a standard motif discovery tool that uses linear regression to determine miRNA seed sites enriched among clusters with many conversion events [28]., There are several open problems in PAR-CLIP data analysis: first, it is unclear which miRNAs should be taken as a starting point for searching seed sites in PAR-CLIP clusters. In all published studies, the top N miRNAs according to miRNA read counts in the PAR-CLIP experiment or an additional experiment are taken. However, read counts provide a potentially strongly biased estimate of miRNA expression levels [29, 30]. In addition, it is unclear how many miRNAs should be used. Finally, it may not be sufficient to consider only known miRNAs: first, there are indications that there are still many unknown miRNAs [31] and second, not only miRNAs (as defined by their maturation pathway) may be associated with AGO and used for target recognition, since there may be other pathways that lead to the incorporation of small RNAs into RISC [32–36]., Second, the specific information given by a PAR-CLIP experiment is only partially exploited: in the PAR-CLIP protocol, RNase T1 is used to digest RNA, which cleaves specifically after guanine [37]. This information could be used to exclude seed sites spanning read start or end positions under the assumption that these sites are protected from digestion by the miRNA. Also, it is known that positions in the mRNA bound to the miRNA cannot be efficiently cross-linked and, thus, seed sites spanning a cross-linking site could also be excluded [23]. Currently, there is no method available that directly uses the information from RNase cleavage sites or conversion sites for the discovery of motifs or the assignment of seed sites. Third, no available scoring system has been demonstrated to identify clusters or assigned miRNAs reliably., Here, we present a method to address these aspects: PAR-CLIP miRNA assignment (PARma) seeks explanations for the presence of each identified PAR-CLIP cluster. Here, an explanation is a k-nucleotide-long sequence (a k-mer) within a cluster that corresponds to the seed of the miRNA binding this site. PARma explains each PAR-CLIP cluster by a k-mer that (a) explains multiple clusters with high probability and (b) matches a generative model for the experimental data (that is, the data observed in the experiment are likely to be generated by amiRNA binding at the determined position). The determined k-mer can identify miRNA families that are characterized by a seed matching the k-mer. The model is able to score each k-mer in a cluster according to the observed conversions and RNase cleavage sites. Parameters as well as k-mer activity probabilities are estimated in an iterative manner. The model assigns the most probable seed to each PAR-CLIP cluster, scores each cluster according to the confidence to correspond to a true miRNA target site and also scores the confidence of the assignment of the correct seed., Differential PAR-CLIP data was used to evaluate our methods: we used pairs of PAR-CLIP datasets with miRNAs that are known to be present in the first dataset but not in the second. When these pairs are analyzed, the target sites (PAR-CLIP clusters) of these miRNAs should only be present in the first dataset. We used our own PAR-CLIP datasets of the two B-cell lines DG75 and BCBL1, of which only the latter is infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a herpesvirus encoding 25 mature miRNAs. In this data, we expect the viral miRNAs, and hence their targets, only to be present in the infected cell line. We also repeated our evaluations using a published dataset of positive and negative cell lines for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which encodes 44 mature miRNAs [25]., In this paper we presented PARma, a method to analyze PAR-CLIP data. Clusters are defined in a similar way as before [23, 28]. The main purposes of PARma are (a) to define reliable miRNA target sites and (b) to identify the miRNA responsible for each identified target site. Therefore, two scores are computed: the Cscore assesses the likelihood that a cluster is a valid miRNA target site and the MAscore corresponds to the confidence that the assigned miRNA is the true regulator., PARma utilizes features specific to PAR-CLIP data to determine seed sites: the positions of cross-linking sites and missing cross-links as well as cleavage sites of RNase T1 relative to seed sites are learned and incorporated into a generative model. This model is used to guide a novel pattern discovery tool, kmerExplain, that estimates activity probabilities for k-mers., Our method can be used to discover active k-mers in an unbiased manner, that is, without assuming a set of admissible k-mers such as the top N miRNA seeds. Each reported active k-mer nevertheless has two properties: it explains several clusters and the positions where it occurs match the model of PAR-CLIP data learned from all target sites. Using differential PAR-CLIP data, we have shown that PARma is more accurate than existing methods and that both Cscore and MAscore are useful measures to rank clusters., PARma is published under the GNU General Public License v3 and is available as supplementary material (see Additional file 1) and from the project website [50]., None declared."

In this review, we discuss how recent advances in ant genomics have contributed to our understanding of the evolution and organization of insect societies at the molecular level., Ants are among the most ecologically diverse and successful animals on our planet. They have colonized most terrestrial environments, where they occupy keystone positions and have strong ecological impacts owing to their crucial roles as scavengers, predators, granivores, herbivores and mutualists [1]. Understanding the ecological dominance of ants requires investigation into the complex organization of their societies., The past three years have seen the publication of seven ant genomes [2–8] (Table 1; Figure 1), an achievement that has given the community studying social insects an unprecedented opportunity to investigate ant societies at the molecular level. The ant genomes provide insights into social insect biology that are complementary to those provided by the honeybee genome published in 2006 [9] because ants have a wider variety of social structures, morphotypes, behaviors, colony sizes and diets.Table 1

(Figure adapted from [81].)
                    , In this review, we focus on six core aspects of ant biology: the production of alternative morphological castes, division of labor, chemical communication, alternative social organization, social immunity and mutualisms (Figure 2). While these issues have been extensively studied from a behavioral and physiological perspective, only now are we beginning to understand them at the molecular level [10–13]. For each issue, we discuss the advances provided by the ant genomes and their use in subsequent studies (Figure 3). Finally, we propose some avenues of research for future molecular studies.

                        Diagram of a typical ant colony representing the six topics discussed in this review. (1) Morphological caste determination. In most ant species, a switch during larval development triggers alternative trajectories toward different female castes. Only the queen and one-worker caste are represented here, but some species also have different morphological worker castes. (2) Division of labor. Different groups of workers perform different tasks. Here, some workers nurse the brood inside the nest, whereas others forage for food outside. (3) Chemical communication. Ants rely on chemical communication for many aspects of their social organization. (4) Social immunity. Ants use both behavioral and physiological defenses to limit the transmission of pathogens and diseases in their societies. (5) Social structure. Ant species differ in the number of queens found in one nest, as well as the number of males that the queens mate with (not shown here). In some cases, these numbers vary between colonies of the same species. (6) Mutualism. Many ant species engage in mutualistic interactions with other organisms. Here, some ants tend and protect aphids in exchange for the sugary honeydew they produce.

                        Pie chart representing the publication volume associated with each topic discussed in this review since the publication of the seven ant genomes. The numbers correspond to the number of studies investigating each topic, including the original genome papers and all publications on social insects citing the genome papers (reviews excluded). The category 'other' incorporates studies of topics that were not discussed in this review (such as sex determination, aging, circadian rhythms, invasiveness, metabolism and neurobiology), as well as studies focusing on social insects but not in a sociobiological context.
                    , One of the most striking features of ants is the presence of queens and workers that can differ greatly in morphology, physiology and behavior. In some species, workers (which are all females) can also differ in size and morphology (such as minors, majors and soldiers). In some species, caste determination stems mostly from a developmental switch controlled by environmental factors, whereas, in others, strong genetic effects can also influence the process of caste determination. These genetic influences range from plastic genotypes that are biased toward queen or worker development to a strictly genetic determination [14]. Thus, ants provide an ideal system to investigate how differences in the social environment trigger developmental switches, changes in gene expression and the production of alternative phenotypes., Recent studies implicate epigenetic processes in caste determination during larval development. Contrary to Drosophila fruit flies and Tribolium flour beetles, all sequenced ant and bee species have a complete set of DNA methylation enzymes [15]. Genome methylation in mammals and plants is widespread and primarily occurs in repetitive, transposable and regulatory elements, whereas it is found mostly in gene bodies in ants and bees, suggesting a fundamentally different function of DNA methylation [16–18]. In the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus and the jumping ant Harpegnathos saltator, DNA methylation is correlated with caste-specific gene expression and alternative splicing, and patterns of DNA methylation change during development [16]. The genomes of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus and the Argentine ant Linepithema humile revealed that annotated genes in the networks that underlie reproductive development, apoptosis and wing polyphenism have fewer CpG sites, the main target sites of DNA methylation, than the genome average [4, 5]. This was interpreted as evidence for elevated rates of methylation in these genes because DNA methylation leads to increased mutation rates and thereby a depletion of CpG sites [19, 20]. By contrast, the opposite pattern was observed in the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes [6], suggesting that there might be important interspecific variation in how DNA methylation affects the production of alternative phenotypes. This is consistent with the recent finding that ant genomes exhibit distinct genome-wide depletion of observed relative to expected CpG sites [20]. Changes in gene transcription are also associated with histone modifications and changes in chromatin structure between castes and developmental stages in H. saltator and C. floridanus [2, 21]. Both genome methylation and histone modification might therefore influence caste determination through transcriptional control and alternative splicing., A recent comparative analysis suggested that the abundance and diversity of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) might also play a role in the evolution of caste-specific patterns of gene expression [20]. TFBSs were found to be more divergent within ants than between social and solitary insects, and genes exhibiting important changes in the abundance of TFBSs between social and solitary insects showed higher levels of gene expression plasticity between castes in C. floridanus (high polymorphism and reproductive division of labor) compared with H. saltator (low polymorphism and reproductive division of labor). Furthermore, the ant genomes revealed that the networks commonly known to exhibit phenotypic plasticity between castes (such as the neuroendocrine system) were preferentially targeted for regulatory changes during the evolution of sociality [20]., The genome sequences also facilitate the identification and study of candidate genes in the process of caste differentiation [5–7, 20]. For example, analysis of insulin signaling, juvenile hormone and vitellogenin expression during artificial hibernation and hormone manipulation revealed how the environmental cues experienced by Pogonomyrmex rugosus queens are translated into the production of new queens and workers [22]. Similarly, the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) was found to harbor two insulin receptors, which might play a role in the process of caste determination [23]. Finally, a study on molecular evolution in S. invicta revealed a positive association between caste-biased gene expression and the rate of gene evolution, the latter being driven largely by variation in the strength of purifying selection [24]. This study also showed that high rates of gene evolution actually preceded gene expression bias associated with the evolution of castes, suggesting that fast-evolving genes are more likely to be recruited to the processes underlying phenotypic plasticity [24]., Genetic effects on morphological caste determination have been found in L. humile [25] and the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior [26, 27]. An extreme case of genetic caste determination occurs in the genus Pogonomyrmex, where some populations contain differentiated genetic lineages, most or all of which derive from historical hybridization between the harvester ants P. rugosus and P. barbatus [28–32]. These lineages always occur in pairs [33], and queens in each lineage-pair mate multiple times with males of their own as well as with males of the alternative lineage. Inter-lineage offspring develop into workers, whereas intra-lineage offspring develop into queens. Thus, the only way that a queen can produce a colony with both workers and queens is by mating with males of both lineages. Crossing experiments revealed that intra-lineage individuals are developmentally constrained to become queens [32]. Inter-lineage individuals have partly retained plasticity and can develop into queens under some conditions, but the association of genotype and caste is very strong, with almost no adult females presenting a mismatch between the genotype and expected phenotype [34]. This provides an interesting system to compare the epigenetic and gene expression changes across developmental stages between individuals for which caste fate is already known [17]., In addition to the reproductive division of labor between queens and workers, there is also usually a strong division of labor between workers, which specialize in different tasks. Worker behavior is influenced by several factors, including size and morphology [35–37], age [38, 39], individual experience [40, 41] and genetic background [42, 43]. Worker behavior and task specialization in ants are often regulated by genes that also affect behavior in solitary insects (the foraging gene and circadian clock genes, for example) [44–48]., Reproduction and behavior are often interconnected in animals. In solitary wasps, for instance, females with developed ovaries lay eggs, whereas females with undeveloped ovaries forage for food. Accordingly, studies in the honeybee Apis mellifera suggest that physiological pathways regulating reproduction and behavior in solitary insects have been co-opted for the regulation of worker behavior in social insect species [49, 50]. Studies in the ant Pogonomyrmex californicus revealed that nurses and foragers differ in ovary activity [51] and juvenile hormone levels [52], which are known to affect the production of vitellogenin (typically involved in reproduction) [22]. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of multiple genes encoding vitellogenin in most of the ant genomes sequenced [53], suggesting that an initial duplication of the ancestral vitellogenin gene occurred after ants diverged from bees and wasps. The ant vitellogenin genes cluster in two paralogous gene families that show caste- and behavior-specific expression in S. invicta [7] and P. rugosus [53], suggesting that vitellogenin in ants not only regulates reproduction but also the behavior of sterile workers [53]. The finding that vitellogenin plays similar roles in ants and bees, which evolved sociality independently, supports the hypothesis that the co-option of reproductive pathways plays a major role in social evolution., Effective communication is an important ingredient for any society to function efficiently. Ants rely heavily on chemical communication for social organization and to discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates [1]. The importance of chemical communication in ants is reflected by large expansions of chemosensory gene families and metabolic pathways for cuticular hydrocarbons in all ant genomes that have been studied in this respect compared with other sequenced hymenopterans [2, 4, 5, 7, 54]. A comparative analysis of antennal transcriptomes between C. floridanus and H. saltator identified many chemoreceptors differentially expressed between males and females, as well as between species, suggesting that sex- and species-specific biology is likely to have shaped the expression patterns of genes involved in communication [54]., A recent study of chemosensory protein genes revealed contrasting modes of evolution between genes occurring only in ants and those also found in the honeybee [55]. Clades with ant-specific expansions showed evidence of faster evolution and elevated levels of positive selection compared with clades of one-to-one orthologs across all ants and the honeybee. A possible explanation is that the more conserved chemosensory protein genes that occur in both ants and bees are associated with more general features of social insect biology, whereas genes in ant-specific expansions might be related to more idiosyncratic environmental and social conditions [55]. At the same time, ant-specific desaturase gene families, which are involved in the production of chemical signals, show an elevated number of genes and high variability in both sequence and expression, possibly reflecting an increased demand for diversity in the chemical signals used in ant communication [20]., There is tremendous variation across ant species in social organization and the number of queens per nest. Such variation in the breeding system can also occur within species, as in S. invicta, where colonies can have one queen (monogyne) or many queens (polygyne). As is the case in other ants, the two social forms not only differ in the number of queens but also in many other traits (such as the reproductive potential of queens, odor and size of both queens and workers, aggressiveness of workers and number of sperms produced by males) [7, 56–58]. The social phenotype of S. invicta is completely associated with two allelic variants at a single locus (Gp-9) encoding an odorant binding protein [56, 59, 60]. Gp-9 was recently found to be located on a pair of heteromorphic social chromosomes (SB and Sb) comprising a large (12.7 Mb) non-recombining genomic region [57]. It is likely that several of the 600-plus genes in the non-recombining region are involved in the many phenotypic differences characterizing individuals harboring the alternative social chromosomes. Comparative studies revealed that these social chromosomes have many properties typical of sex chromosomes. First, the lack of recombination is also associated with several inversions. Second, one of the two variants (the Sb chromosome) occurs only in one type of social organization (the polygyne form), just as the Y chromosome occurs only in males. Third, the Sb chromosome cannot recombine with itself because individuals having two copies of this chromosome die within weeks after reaching the adult stage. Finally, the inability of the Sb chromosome to recombine with itself or with the SB chromosome has been associated with the accumulation of many repetitive elements, in a manner similar to that of the Y chromosome [57]. While this is the first description of a social chromosome, it is likely that such supergenes also exist in other social insects. Polymorphism in social organization has evolved independently numerous times in ants, where many species have both monogyne and polygyne colonies. The occurrence of the polygyne social form is associated almost invariably with a polygyny syndrome whereby, as in S. invicta, polygyne queens are smaller, accumulate reduced amounts of fat during sexual maturation, have lower fecundity and initiate new colonies with the help of workers, rather than independently [61]. Interestingly, it appears that variation in queen number is also associated with a single non-recombining region in the ant Formica selysi (J Purcell, A Brelsford and M Chapuisat, unpublished data)., Another important aspect of social life is that it facilitates the transmission of pathogens and diseases owing to the associated high population densities and frequent social contacts [62]. Thus, one could expect social insects to have more efficient immune systems and more genes involved in immunity compared with solitary species. Surprisingly, early comparative analyses reported that both the honeybee and the ants have fewer immune genes than do Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum [4–6, 9, 63–66]. Social insects have multiple collective behavioral defenses against pathogens, such as grooming other colony members [67] or the intake of tree resin with anti-pathogenic properties [68]. It has thus been proposed that such prophylactic behaviors might reduce the selective pressure for increasing the number of immune genes in the genome [4–6]. However, a recent comparative-genomic analysis shows that only 3 of 16 immune-gene families differed significantly between social and solitary insect species [20]. This finding, combined with the fact that the non-social parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis also contains fewer immune genes than do flies and beetles [69], suggests that the depletion of immune genes in social insects is not as dramatic as initially proposed and might not be directly associated with sociality., Specific features of the ant immune system could also account for the lower number of immune genes in their genomes. The genome of C. floridanus revealed the antimicrobial peptide hymenoptaecin to be a large precursor protein with multiple bioactive domains [65, 66], suggesting a diverse array of possible immune functions. Hymenoptaecin is present in all other ants, the honeybee, as well as Nasonia vitripennis [5, 65, 69]. Finally, behavioral analyses combined with RNA-seq of genes implicated in physiological immune defenses in A. echinatior confirmed the existence of efficient prophylactic behaviors and showed that, in most conditions, pathogenic challenges triggered an increase in immune gene expression. However, ants challenged with a fungus-garden pathogen showed a decrease in immune gene expression while displaying more prophylactic behaviors, suggesting that trade-offs might occur between physiological and behavioral immune responses [70]., Another key type of interspecific interaction in ants lies in the evolution of diverse and ecologically important forms of mutualisms with plants (Acacia trees, for example) [71] and other insects (such as aphids) [72]. Approximately 50 million years ago, one ant clade also evolved a complex system of fungus farming [73]. The current repertoire of sequenced ant genomes includes two species of fungus farming leaf-cutting ants (A. cephalotes and A. echinatior), which cultivate their food fungus on leaf fragments harvested from the vegetation surrounding their nest [1]. The analysis of their genomes revealed that the genes necessary for the biosynthesis of the amino acid arginine are lacking (in contrast to C. floridanus, S. invicta and H. saltator), but that they are present in their symbiotic fungus [3, 6]. This suggests that leaf-cutting ants have become completely dependent on their food fungus over evolutionary time. These findings highlight the benefit of genomic resources for identifying the potential physiological consequences of evolution in complex societies and pave the way for further studies to better understand the genomic impact of obligate mutualisms in ants and other organisms., Analysis of the seven sequenced ant genomes has already led to significant advances in our understanding of important aspects of ant biology. Below, we highlight three avenues of research that we believe will prove fruitful as this endeavor continues., First, large comparative analyses of the genomes of ants, social bees and social wasps (which evolved sociality independently) with the genomes of solitary bees, wasps and other insects will be needed to investigate the key evolutionary changes associated with sociality in the Hymenoptera. The only study that has conducted such a comparative analysis so far has provided valuable information on the evolution of several aspects of social organization (caste determination, chemical communication and social immunity), as discussed above [20]., A second important step will be to perform functional studies to validate experimentally the numerous hypotheses generated by comparative analyses. So far, only a handful of studies have manipulated gene expression in ants using RNA interference [74, 75], hormonal treatments [22, 76] or pharmacological manipulations [47], and none of them investigated the consequences at the genome scale. Forward genetics, using, for example, random mutagenesis, has been prohibitive in ants and other social insects because these approaches require substantial subsequent crossing. This is not feasible in ants mainly owing to their long generation times and the difficulty to breed most species in the laboratory. However, reverse-genetic approaches for social insects using new and highly effective tools for targeted genome editing have now come within reach. These approaches use engineered nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) [77], transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) [78] or CRISPR RNA-guided Cas9 nucleases [79, 80]. Although these techniques will not be able to overcome the fundamental experimental limitations posed by many ant species, they are now opening up the possibility of creating transgenics and genetic knockouts for a subset of carefully chosen model species that can be propagated in the laboratory. Studies using combinations of genetic, pharmacological, social, hormonal and pheromonal manipulations will be necessary to provide a better understanding of the actual roles of different genes and physiological pathways in regulating ant social life., Finally, understanding the molecular organization of ant societies will require precise behavioral data at the individual level to investigate the links between communication, gene expression, physiology and behavior. Collecting such data has long been a difficult task, but a new automated tracking system now allows the automatic quantification of all social interactions between all individuals in an ant colony over the course of several weeks. Using this system has already demonstrated the importance of spatial distribution in the regulation of age-related division of labor in insect societies [39]. The use of such sophisticated behavioral tracking and quantification, combined with next-generation genomic data, could well provide the next answers to the big questions in the biology of social insects., In conclusion, social insects have played a central role in our understanding of the organization and behaviors of complex animal societies, principally from ethological and ecological perspectives. The advent of next-generation sequencing techniques now provides opportunities to use social insects to study how genetic and environmental contributions interact to control societal organization."

Whole-genome sequencing of a tumor sample yields reads from this mixture, but does not directly reveal the cell of origin for each read. We introduce THetA (Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis), an algorithm that infers the most likely collection of genomes and their proportions in a sample, for the case where copy number aberrations distinguish subpopulations. THetA successfully estimates normal admixture and recovers clonal and subclonal copy number aberrations in real and simulated sequencing data. THetA is available at http://​compbio.​cs.​brown.​edu/​software/​
              , Cancer is a disease driven in part by somatic mutations, which accumulate during the lifetime of an individual. The clonal theory of cancer progression [1] states that the cancerous cells in a tumor are descended from a single founder cell and that descendants of this founder cell acquired multiple mutations beneficial for tumor growth through multiple rounds of selection and clonal expansion. A tumor is thus a heterogeneous population of cells, each cell potentially containing a different complement of somatic mutations. These include both clonal mutations from the founder cell or early rounds of clonal expansion and subclonal mutations that occurred after the most recent clonal expansion. Alternatively, subclonal mutations may suggest that the tumor is polyclonal, consisting of subpopulations of cells that are not all descended from a single founder cell [2]., High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies are now giving an unprecedented view of this intra-tumor mutational heterogeneity [3]. However, nearly all recent cancer sequencing projects generate DNA sequence from tumor samples consisting of many cells - including both normal (non-cancerous) cells and one or more distinct populations of tumor cells. The tumor purity of a sample is the fraction of cells in the sample that are cancerous, and not normal cells. If a sample has a low tumor purity, then the power to detect all types of somatic aberrations in the cancer genomes is reduced. For example, lower tumor purity attenuates copy number ratios or allele frequencies away from the values expected with integral copy numbers. Methods to detect somatic copy number aberrations or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from SNP array data or array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data must account for this issue [4–9]. In addition, many algorithms for identifying somatic single-nucleotide mutations from DNA sequence reads implicitly or explicitly rely on an estimate of tumor purity. For example, the VarScan 2 program [10] uses an estimate of tumor purity as input to calibrate the expected number of reads that contain a somatic mutation at a locus., Traditionally, tumor purity was assessed by visual analysis of tumor cells, either manually by a pathologist or via image analysis [11]. Recently, methods such as ASCAT [12] and ABSOLUTE [13] were introduced to estimate tumor purity directly from SNP array data. Both of these methods utilize the presence of copy number aberrations in cancer genomes to estimate both tumor purity and tumor ploidy, which is the number of copies of segments of chromosomes or entire chromosomes. Tumor purity and tumor ploidy are intertwined; for example, a heterozygous deletion of one copy of a chromosome in a 100% pure tumor sample (containing one cancer genome) could also be explained as a homozygous deletion in a 50% pure tumor sample (containing one cancer genome). Thus, it is necessary to estimate tumor purity and ploidy simultaneously, but this is a subtle and difficult problem. ASCAT and ABSOLUTE address this problem by estimating the average ploidy over the entire cancer genome. These estimates of tumor purity and average ploidy are then used in a second step to derive copy number aberrations., Both ASCAT and ABSOLUTE have been shown to yield accurate estimates of tumor purity, achieving in some cases better estimates than via pathology or other techniques. However, these methods also have important limitations. First, the mathematical models used by ASCAT and ABSOLUTE are optimized for SNP array data, as we detail below. While these methods may be adapted to run on DNA sequencing data (for example, for ABSOLUTE see [14] and for ASCAT see below), the underlying mathematical model used by both methods does not adequately describe the characteristics of sequencing data. Second, both of these methods apply various heuristics in their estimation procedures, such as rounding copy numbers to the closest integer [12] and do not directly infer integer copy numbers for each segment of the genome during the estimation. Finally, both methods do not explicitly identify multiple tumor subpopulations, and instead infer only a single tumor subpopulation. For example, ABSOLUTE [13] classifies copy number aberrations as outliers if they are not clonal, but does not refine these outliers into subpopulations. If a tumor sample consists of multiple tumor subpopulations, then considering only a single tumor population may yield inaccurate estimates of tumor purity, as we show below., High-throughput DNA sequencing data is much higher resolution data than SNP arrays, and provides the opportunity to derive highly accurate estimates of both tumor purity and the composition of tumor subpopulations. For example, the number of reads containing a somatic single-nucleotide mutation at a locus provides - in principle - an estimate of the fraction of cells in a tumor sample containing this mutation. However, three interrelated factors complicate this analysis: (1) The number of reads supporting a somatic single-nucleotide mutation has high variance, implying that an estimate of the allele frequency will be highly unreliable at the modest coverages (30× to 40×) employed in nearly all current cancer sequencing projects. (2) Somatic mutations may be present in only a fraction of tumor cells. (3) Somatic copy number aberrations (nearly ubiquitous in solid tumors) alter the number of copies of the locus containing the mutation. While the first issue might be addressed in part by clustering allele frequency estimates across the genome [15–17], the second and third issues complicate such a clustering. Recent methods for analyzing tumor composition from DNA sequencing data either ignore copy number aberrations [17] or use iterative approaches [18] or other approximations [12, 13], and do not formally model the generation of DNA sequencing data from a mixture of integral copy numbers for each genomic segment., Beyond the estimation of tumor purity and ploidy, it is desirable to identify subclonal aberrations, which can provide information on the age or history of the tumor [19], and can yield further insight into tumors that fail to respond to treatment or metastasize [19–21]. However, even with a pure tumor sample, characterizing subclonal mutations is a challenge. Tolliver et al. [22] infer subclonal copy number aberrations by comparing aberrations across different individuals, thus assuming that the progression of somatic copy number aberrations is conserved across individuals. Gerlinger et al. [23] recently demonstrated the extent of subclonal mutations by sequencing multiple (spatially separated) samples from a tumor, complementing earlier studies of heterogeneity using microarray-based techniques [24]. In another approach, Ding et al. [17] used a targeted ultra-deep sequencing (1,000 × coverage) approach to estimate allele frequencies for relapse mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In another recent study, Nik-Zainal et al. [25] used a SNP array based estimate of tumor purity [12] followed by extensive manual analysis of somatic mutations to identify a clonal (majority) population and a number of subclonal populations in each of several breast cancer genomes. Ultimately, single-cell sequencing techniques promise to provide a comprehensive view of cancer heterogeneity [26–29], but these techniques presently require specialized DNA amplification steps, which can introduce artifacts and also incur higher costs because they sequence many cells. Thus, the problem of the simultaneous estimation of and correction for tumor purity as well as the identification of clonal and subclonal mutations will remain a challenge for the majority of cancer sequencing projects., In this paper, we introduce Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis (THetA), an algorithm that infers the most likely collection of genomes and their proportions from high-throughput DNA sequencing data, in the case where copy number aberrations distinguish subpopulations. In contrast to existing methods, we formulate and optimize an explicit probabilistic model for the generation of the observed tumor sequencing data from a mixture of a normal genome and one or more cancer genomes, each genome containing integral copy numbers of its segments. Specifically, we derive and solve the maximum likelihood mixture decomposition problem (MLMDP) of finding a collection of genomes - each differing from the normal genome by copy number aberrations - whose mixture best explains the observed sequencing data. Thus, we generalize the problem of estimating tumor purity to the problem of determining the proportions of normal cells and any number of tumor subpopulations in the sample., Our formulation and solution of the MLMDP leverages the fact that copy number aberrations create a strong signal in DNA sequencing data: even relatively small copy number aberrations cause deviations in the alignments of thousands to millions of reads. Thus, in contrast to single-nucleotide mutations, where there is high variance in the number of reads at each position, many measurements (reads) are perturbed for each copy number aberration. Thus, each copy number aberration provides many data points for deconvolution of the tumor genome mixture. We show how to solve the MLMDP as a collection of convex optimization problems. THetA is the first algorithm - to our knowledge - that automatically identifies subclonal copy number aberrations in whole-genome sequencing data from mixtures of more than two genomes. Moreover, in the case of an admixture between a single (clonal) cancer population and normal cells, THetA runs in polynomial time; it is the first rigorous and efficient algorithm for simultaneously estimating tumor purity and inferring integral copy numbers., We apply our THetA algorithm to simulated data and to real DNA sequencing data from breast tumors sequenced at approximately 188× and approximately 40× coverage from [25]. We quantify the normal cell admixture in each tumor, outperforming other algorithms for this task. We also demonstrate that allowing only one tumor subpopulation may lead to highly inaccurate tumor purity estimates, and subsequent failure to detect clonal and subclonal copy number aberrations. In the 188× sequenced tumor, we identify both clonal and subclonal tumor cell populations, each containing unique copy number aberrations. Our results recapitulate most of the findings reported in [25] for this sample, but also have some distinct differences, which are supported by the sequencing data. In one of the 40× sequenced tumors, we identified two previously unreported tumor subpopulations, demonstrating the ability to identify intra-tumor heterogeneity, in particular subclonal aberrations, at the modest sequence coverages that are the current standard in cancer sequencing studies., We introduce Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis (THetA), an algorithm that infers the most likely collection of genomes and their proportions from high-throughput DNA sequencing data, in the case where copy number aberrations distinguish subpopulations. We show that THetA outperforms three other methods, CNAnorm [18], ASCAT [12] and ABSOLUTE [13], for inferring tumor purity and identifying copy number aberrations in the case of a single tumor cell population admixed with normal (non-cancerous) cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that THetA successfully estimates tumor purity even at low purity (10%) and with modest sequence coverages (approximately 30×) on both real and simulated data. In contrast to other recent methods [12, 13] that first infer average ploidy across the genome, THetA simultaneously estimates tumor purity and computes the integral copy number of each genomic segment/interval. These advantages result from THetA exploiting the large number of data points (reads) that measure copy number aberrations in high-throughput sequencing data - information that is not available from SNP arrays., We also demonstrate that THetA successfully deconvolves a tumor sample into a normal population and multiple tumor subpopulations, inferring the proportion of each subpopulation in the mixture, and partitioning copy number aberrations into clonal and subclonal populations. Other existing methods, such as ASCAT [12], ABSOLUTE [13] and CNAnorm [18], do not directly infer multiple subpopulations. Further, we show that these methods can produce highly inaccurate estimates of tumor purity on samples containing multiple subpopulations, and are sometimes unable to identify some copy number aberrations that occur in subpopulations of tumor cells. In addition, THetA reports all possible solutions of interval count matrices C and genome mixing vectors μ with the same maximum likelihood, allowing users to explore different maximum likelihood solutions. Thus, THetA is an attractive alternative to these methods., We demonstrated the advantages of THetA using three breast cancer genomes sequenced in [25]: one sequenced at approximately 188× coverage and two at approximately 40× coverage. Nik-Zainal et al. [25] showed how a large amount of information about a tumor's evolutional history can be derived by analyzing clonal and subclonal mutations in high-coverage sequencing data. Our THetA algorithm automates some of the manual analysis involved in such reconstructions. For the 188× genome, our results are largely concordant with the extensive analysis and annotation of this sample in [25]. THetA automatically recovered nearly all of the copy number aberrations reported in [25], but with some differences in the classification of aberrations as clonal or subclonal. Allele data not used by THetA provides external evidence that support the THetA results in several cases. On one of the 40× coverage genomes, we identified two previously unreported tumor subpopulations in nearly equal proportions, as well as a 24% normal admixture. These results are supported by statistical comparisons of read depth ratios, and also allowed us to identify copy-neutral LOH on chromosome 8q. Thus, we demonstrated that it is possible to identify multiple tumor populations successfully in a single sample by considering a subset of genomic intervals. Further, we did so for an approximately 40× sequenced tumor, demonstrating the ability to identify intra-tumor heterogeneity at sequence coverages that are the current standard in cancer sequencing studies., THetA uses only read depth for inferring intra-tumor heterogeneity, in contrast to other methods [12, 13, 17, 25] that use allele frequencies of heterozygous germline SNPs and somatic mutations. Since copy number aberrations - even those of a modest size - affect a large number of reads, THetA is able to infer multiple tumor subpopulations directly from sequencing data. However, THetA also has some limitations. First, the reliance on copy number aberrations means that THetA is unable to identify tumor subpopulations that do not contain copy number aberrations. As copy number aberrations are ubiquitous in many types of cancers, particularly solid tumors, we expect that THetA will prove useful for analyzing a wide range of different cancer samples. Second, while the mathematical model used by THetA allows for any number of subpopulations, in practice the number of subpopulations that can be correctly inferred depends on having at least one copy number aberration that distinguishes every subpopulation. Finally, THetA's computation time increases with an increasing number of subpopulations., Our focus in the development of THetA was to address rigorously the difficult problem of analyzing tumor purity and subclonal copy number aberrations from DNA sequencing data. A logical next step is to use the output from THetA to help predict single-nucleotide mutations in tumor samples and/or assess the clonality of somatic mutations, both challenging problems in their own right. Carter et al. [13] and Nik-Zainal et al. [25] show that once tumor purity is correctly estimated, then this value can be used to analyze the clonality/subclonality of somatic mutations. Incorporating the additional signal of variant allele frequencies into the probabilistic model, as well as extending the model to allele-specific copy number changes [52], are important directions for future work. Ultimately, a desirable goal is to integrate into a single probabilistic framework the detection of all types of somatic aberrations (single nucleotide, copy number and rearrangements) with the estimation of tumor purity and the derivation of tumor subpopulations. Finally, further algorithmic improvements in THetA would help in the analysis of more complicated tumor samples that have more intervals (for example, smaller copy number aberrations), higher amplitude copy number aberrations, more subpopulations or more complicated rearrangements; for example, due to breakage/fusion/bridge (B/F/B) cycles [53], chromothripsis [54] or extrachromosomal amplifications [55]. THetA runs in polynomial time for a mixture of two genomes with intervals of equal weight, but the question of the complexity of the MLMDP for n > 2 remains open., A number of other techniques have recently been used to study intra-tumor heterogeneity. For example [56] uses expression profiles across different individuals to identify differentially expressed genes with respect to healthy cells at the cancer site of origin. Single-cell sequencing and multi-region sequencing from a primary tumor are alternative strategies that have been successfully employed [23–29]. As these technologies improve they will likely further contribute to our understanding of intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, sequencing of primary tumor samples as well as matched tumor/metastasis samples will remain a dominant protocol for some time. Thus, algorithms, such as THetA, ABSOLUTE, ASCAT and others, that can derive information about intra-tumor heterogeneity from DNA sequencing of tumor samples are a useful complement to other technologies and techniques for tumor heterogeneity studies., Tumors are highly heterogeneous with individual cells in a tumor typically having different complements of somatic mutations. Highly accurate estimates of tumor purity and tumor subpopulation frequencies are necessary for investigating intra-tumor heterogeneity from single tumor samples. We introduce THetA, an algorithm that infers the most likely collection of genomes and their proportions from high-throughput DNA sequencing data, in the case where copy number aberrations distinguish subpopulations. We show the power of THetA with both simulated and real sequencing data - demonstrating the ability to identify intra-tumor heterogeneity (in particular subclonal copy number aberrations) at modest sequence coverages (approximately 40×) that are the current standard in cancer sequencing studies."

Of these, 82 have higher and 58 have lower abundance in AD patient samples. We selected a panel of 12 miRNAs for an RT-qPCR analysis on a larger cohort of 202 samples, comprising not only AD patients and healthy controls but also patients with other CNS illnesses. These included mild cognitive impairment, which is assumed to represent a transitional period before the development of AD, as well as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. miRNA target enrichment analysis of the selected 12 miRNAs indicates an involvement of miRNAs in nervous system development, neuron projection, neuron projection development and neuron projection morphogenesis. Using this 12-miRNA signature, we differentiate between AD and controls with an accuracy of 93%, a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 92%. The differentiation of AD from other neurological diseases is possible with accuracies between 74% and 78%. The differentiation of the other CNS disorders from controls yields even higher accuracies., The data indicate that deregulated miRNAs in blood might be used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD or other neurological diseases.","Alzheimer disease, miRNA, biomarker, next-generation sequencing, quantitative Real Time PCR","Alzheimer disease(AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative illness leading to dementia which is predicted to affect as much as 1 in 85 people globally by 2050 [1]. While early-onset (familiar) AD has been reported in younger people, the majority of (sporadic) AD cases is diagnosed in people aged over 65 years [2]. As of today, final diagnosis of AD can only be achieved by autopsy making the identification of reliable, early, and non-invasive biomarkers a major challenge. Finding such non-invasive, reliable diagnostic tools is of paramount importance as it appears that early intervention in the prodromal stage of AD or the identification and therapy of those patients with mild cognitive impairment who will transform to AD rapidly might be a possibility to delay the onset of AD substantially [3]., A prominent example of recently developed AD biomarker assays is the combinatorial analysis of the concentration of peptides and proteins: beta-amyloid-1-42 (Aß 42), tau, and/or p-tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). According to the S3 guidelines, an increased level of tau protein together with a decreased level of beta-amyloid-1-42 provides strong evidence for the presence of AD [4]. The combinatorial analysis of all three factors yields even higher diagnostic accuracy than the combination of only two of the above-mentioned proteins [5]. Furthermore, combinatorial analysis of Aß levels and tau levels can discriminate between patients with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with progressive MCI into AD or other types of dementia with a sufficient diagnostic accuracy [6]. Nevertheless, according to the S3 guidelines, the analysis of CSF biomarker is only indicated to confirm the diagnosis if other clinical symptoms give evidence for the presence of neurodegenerative dementia or for the differential diagnostics of other forms of diseases that can cause symptoms like dementia (encephalitis, neuroborreliosis, multiple sclerosis, Lues, brain abscess, metastases)., The use of peripheral markers, like Aß and tau in easily accessible peripheral cells (in particular platelets and skin fibroblasts), as a diagnostic tool has been under investigation for more than 10 years [7, 8]. Molecular genetics analyses of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes such as presenilin or ApoE4 did not significantly improve risk estimation for the susceptibility of AD [9]. Likewise, there is no consistent evidence for an association between AD and genetic variation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) [10]., There is increasing effort to develop molecular diagnostic markers that meet requirements like easy accessibility, for example, from blood, sufficiently high specificity and sensitivity, low costs and applicability by laboratories with standard equipment. Several blood, plasma, or serum born AD biomarkers have been proposed to meet these criteria. Doecke et al. recently presented a panel of protein biomarkers to reliably detect AD with an accuracy of 85% [11]. Moreover, Tan et al. provided evidence that the proteins p53 and p21 can be used to detect AD using blood samples. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a specificity of 76% and a sensitivity of 84% for p53, 88% and 82% for p53(ser15), 80% and 75% for p21, and 84% and 68% for p21(thr145) [12]., Besides proteins microRNAs (miRNAs) have also demonstrated their potential as non-invasive biomarkers from blood and serum for a wide variety of human pathologies [13]. A deregulation of miRNA expression might be involved in neurological dysfunction or neurodegenerative processes. Interestingly, Liang et al. [14] showed that the expression pattern of brain and blood PBMC cluster together which might be an indication that a specific blood based expression signature might prove to be useful as biomarker for AD and other neurological diseases. MiRNA expression analyses can be readily applied for in vitro diagnostic testing by molecular diagnostics and CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) laboratories., While altered miRNA patterns have been exhaustively investigated in AD patients' tissue samples or cell cultures [15–18], less information on circulating miRNAs in AD is known. A recent serum profiling of AD patients provided first evidence that expression changes of circulating miRNAs may be valuable biomarkers for AD [19]., We describe our results obtained by applying the next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to screen the expression of all human miRNAs in blood from extensively characterized AD patients and healthy controls. Patient blood was obtained from the SAMPLE (Serial Alzheimer diseaseand MCI Prospective Longitudinal Evaluation) Registry of PrecisionMed (San Diego, CA, USA) and blood from age-matched healthy donors from the ACE (Aging Cognition Evaluation) Registry, a PrecisionMed- UBC (The University of British Columbia) collaboration. We identified 140 unique differentially expressed miRNAs between AD patients and controls. Validation of a 12-miRNA signature was carried out by RT-qPCR in a cohort of 202 samples encompassing patients suffering from other neurological disorders including mild cognitive impairment as a potential preliminary stage of AD, and other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis as well as mental diseases like schizophrenia (SCHIZ), major depression (DEP), and bipolar disorder (BD)., A combination of AD-specific miRNA expression signatures with the rapidly developing and expanding amyloid load imaging techniques may be useful as non-invasive diagnostic tools in AD diagnosis in the future [20]., At present, there is no single molecular test that is suitable to reliably diagnose AD with adequate specificity and sensitivity. Tests for the analysis of CSF proteins like Aß42 or tau have high specificity and sensitivity, but are only indicated as confirmation of AD diagnosis based on clinical symptoms or as differential diagnosis to differentiate between AD and other forms of diseases that can cause symptoms like dementia. The analysis of SNPs in certain genes (for example, ApoE) yields too low diagnostic accuracy and is therefore not recommended as diagnostic test for AD. Furthermore, Ray et al. yielded promising results by the identification of 18 proteins in blood plasma that could differentiate AD patients from controls with 90% accuracy [25]., Here, we investigate whether blood-borne miRNA expression signatures might contribute to AD diagnosis. Until now, many efforts have been made to understand the role of miRNAs in neurodegenerative disorders, as summarized by Eacker et al. [26]. However, there are only two publications dealing with the miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of AD patients. The study by Villa et al. analyzed the expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A1, that is involved in the maturation of APP mRNA, and showed that the decreased expression of hsa-miR-590-3p is negatively correlated with the increased hnRNP-A1 mRNA levels [27]. The study by Schipper et al. [28] investigated the expression of 462 different miRNAs in PBMCs of 16 AD patients and 16 healthy controls to identify miRNAs that are responsible for the regulation of transcription of mRNA species that were previously reported to be downregulated in PBMCs of AD patients [29]. Only a modest relative increase of miRNA expression in AD PBMC in the range of 1.1- to 1.4-fold was found for nine miRNAs, namely hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-579, hsa-miR-181b, hsa-miR-520h, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-517*, hsa-let-7f, hsa-miR-200a, and hsa-miR-371. These data link the development of AD pathology to systemic dysfunction in the cellular stress/antioxidant response and genomic maintenance [28]., Using high throughput sequencing, we identified 140 unique miRNAs from 180 precursors that were differentially expressed between whole blood obtained from AD patients and healthy controls. It is incumbent upon the investigator, who proposes a set of miRNAs as done here to examine whether there is any known connection of these miRNAs and their target genes to neurodegeneration. Below we discuss this aspect in respect to our findings of dys-regulated miRNAs in blood of AD patients compared to healthy controls., According to our TAM analysis out of the downregulated miRNAs, six were associated with the disease category Alzheimer disease including hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-29b, hsa-miR-106b, and hsa-miR-107. In a mouse model, Wang et al. investigated the involvement of hsa-miR-106b in the TGF-β signaling pathway that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD and found an inverse correlation between the expression of hsa-miR-106b and TGF-β type II receptor (TβR II) protein level [30]. In addition, Hebert et al. showed that hsa-miR-106b affects the expression of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) in vitro. Furthermore, they found a statistically significant decrease in hsa-miR-106b expression in sporadic AD patients, but the correlation between miR-106b and APP expression in AD brain was not significant [31]. The same group showed an inverse correlation between increased BACE1 levels and decreased miR-29a/b-1 expression [15]. Shioya et al. also observed a decreased expression of hsa-miR-29a in brain tissue of AD patients [32]. They also identified neuron navigator 3 (NAV3), a regulator of axon guidance, as a target of hsa-miR-29a and found elevated NAV3 mRNA levels in AD brains [32]. Hsa-miR-17 was shown to regulate APP expression in vitro and under physiological conditions in cells [31, 33]. MiR-21 was shown to be downregulated in time-course assays of mature murine primary hippocampal cell cultures after neuronal Aβ treatments [34]., We further performed over-representation analysis with the 2,354 predicted targets of the 10 known miRNAs of our 12-miRNA signature. Here, several GO categories, with significant enrichment of miRNA targets in the GO categories linked to the nervous system, were found. Most interestingly, some of these target genes have already been related to AD or other of the investigated neurological diseases. One of the most prominent examples is DRD1 that encodes the Dopamine receptor D1, which is the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system. DRD1 is associated with AD, BD, and SCHIZ. Another example, DISC1 (disrupted in SCHIZ), associated with BD and SCHIZ, encodes a protein involved in neurite outgrowth and cortical development. BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) important for survival of striatal neurons in the brain is known to be downregulated in AD patients and also associated with BD, DEP, PD, and SCHIZ. IGF1R is the only target gene that was exclusively found to be associated with AD. The protein encoded by this gene is increased in temporal cortex surrounding and within Aß-containing plaques, but a significantly lower number of neurons of AD patients express IGF1R [35]. This suggests that IGF1R signaling normally controlling vital growth, survival, and metabolic functions in the brain is disturbed in AD brains. The two unknown miRNAs revealed 234 target genes for brain-miR-112, but only six target genes for brain-miR-161. In the over-representation analysis for brain-miR-112 we also identified GO categories linked to the nervous system, including targets like DISC1 as discussed above. For brain-miR-161 we found no significant GO categories. However, a literature review of the six target genes of brain-miR-161 revealed some interesting findings. GRID1 (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 1), predicted to be a target gene of brain-miR-161, encodes a gene product that is a subunit of glutamate receptor channels which mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and play key roles in synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, GRID1 has previously been associated with SCHIZ and BD [36–38]. Another predicted target gene CCDN2 (Cyclin D2) plays a role in corticogenesis [39]., However, we have to point out that our analysis is based on whole blood. Previous findings on cancer suggest that the miRNA expression pattern between blood cells and cancer tissue do not necessarily show the same expression pattern but some overlaps can be found [40–42]. Unfortunately, tissue and blood samples of the same patients were not available for the present study. Nevertheless, we performed database analysis and extracted all miRNAs deregulated in AD and the corresponding literature out of the Human MiRNA& Disease Database [43]. In total, we found 18 different publications, with 15 publications on AD brain tissue and/or cell culture models. Out of those studies, 29 different miRNAs deregulated in AD are listed in the HMDD. Comparing these miRNAs with our data revealed eight of the 29 miRNAs that were significantly dys-regulated in blood cells in our study. There is, however, no evidence whether these overlaps were found by chance or not. Any link between deregulated miRNAs in blood of patients with neurological diseases and the disease itself has to be considered with caution., Since a large set of miRNAs often contains a significant amount of redundant miRNAs with largely identical information content the differentiation between AD samples and healthy controls using a reduced set of miRNAs may likely yield comparably accurate results. Therefore, a panel of 12 miRNAs with limited cross-correlation, including most strongly dys-regulated miRNAs that show a potential to separate AD from controls, was selected. Some of these 12 miRNAs have already been related to AD. For example, Wang et al. showed in a computational analysis that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA is targeted by hsa-miR-107 and that BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression for AD. An increased BACE1 expression is an important risk factor for sporadic AD [15]. Nelson et al. also showed a negative correlation between the expression of hsa-miR-107 and BACE1 [44]. Interestingly, hsa-miR-107 that was also part of our 12-miRNA signature investigated in the presented study was also downregulated in blood of AD patients compared to healthy controls. Augustin et al. [45] recently investigated miRNAs that are predicted to target another AD-related gene, namely ADAM10, which controls the proteolytic processing of APP and the formation of the amyloid plaques. Database analyses prompted them to further investigate two miRNAs that were also included in our 12-miRNA signature, namely hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-103. They found that predicted target genes of hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-103 showed significant overlap with the AlzGene database. In a reporter assay ADAM10 expression was reduced by both miRNAs. These two miRNAs were also investigated in relation to the expression of cofilin protein in a transgenic mouse model [46]. Cofilin binds to actin resulting in the formation of Hirano bodies, which may play an essential role in AD pathogenesis. In APP transgenic mouse brains hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-103 levels were decreased while cofilin levels were increased and in a luciferase assay it was demonstrated that hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-103 were able to reduce the expression of cofilin. In our RT-qPCR approach both miRNAs hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-103 showed the same expression pattern, that is, both were downregulated in blood of AD, PD, DEP, and SCHIZ patients and upregulated in mild cognitive impairment, multiple sclerosis, and BD patients. All other miRNAs of our 12-miRNA signature have not been identified or investigated so far in relationship to AD., While we showed the 12-miRNA signature's potential to separate AD patients from controls with an accuracy of 93.3%, we also tested its applicability as differential diagnostic biomarker to separate AD from other neurological diseases. As we expected, the accuracy decreased when trying to use this signature for separating other neurodegenerative diseases from controls or separating AD from other neurological disorders. Remarkably, the classification of psychiatric disorders versus controls yielded an even better accuracy than for AD versus controls. These findings suggest a relevance of the considered 12 miRNAs also for psychological disorders. The association of the 12-miRNA signature with neurological diseases in general is further underlined by the results of our over-representation analysis using GeneTrail. Here, we found four significant GO categories related to nervous system and neurons with an over-representation of target genes of the 10 known miRNAs from our 12-miRNA signature. In addition, out of the 10 known miRNAs nine miRNAs are already included in the HMDD and five of those miRNAs that were previously associated with neurological diseases including AD, PD, and SCHIZ. As mentioned above, Yao et al. [46] showed that reduced levels of hsa-miR-103 or hsa-miR-107 are associated with elevated cofilin protein levels and formation of rod-like structures in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Both miRNAs were also downregulated in our study. Martins et al. [47] showed that hsa-miR-151a-3p and hsa-miR-26a-5p are differentially expressed in PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of PD patients and controls. In prefrontal cortex tissue of individuals with SCHIZ hsa-miR-26b was downregulated [48]. Target analysis of the miRNA that was not included in HMDD, hsa-miR-5010-3p, revealed target genes involved in nervous system processes. For example, predicted targets of hsa-miR-5010-3p include the NFASC (neurofascin), that functions in neurite outgrowth, and organization of nodes of Ranvier on axons, NPY (Neuropeptide Y), that is one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the mammalian central nervous system [49], NLGN1 (neuroligin 1), that may be involved in the formation and remodeling of central nervous system synapses, NRXN3 (neurexin3), that functions in the nervous system as receptors and cell adhesion molecule, and NCAN (neurocan), that seems to be a genetic risk factor for BD., Finally, one has to take into account that AD is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disease causing cognitive, behavioral, and functional problems that are also found in other neurological diseases. Furthermore, dementia is not only caused by AD but can result from other neurological disorders. Dementia patients often suffer from other additional mental and behavioral problems like depression, anxiety, psychosis, agitation, and aggression further complicating correct classification. As AD shares common neuropsychiatric symptoms with other neurological diseases there might be an overlap with the associated medication., Most importantly one needs to point out that as the patients included in our study are not treatment-naïve, we cannot exclude the influence of administered drugs on the miRNA signature. As an example, Bocchio-Chiavetto et al. showed that chronic anti-depressant treatment has effects on the blood miRNA profile [50]. Furthermore, we have to point out that we do not have a birth cohort. Nevertheless, the age distribution between the AD samples and the control samples used for NGS is not significantly different (Pvalue 0.1147). The age distribution of AD patients, MCI patients, PD patients, and controls is quite similar. Patients suffering from multiple sclerosis, DEP, BD, or SCHIZ are about 20 to 30 years younger. The differences in the age distribution are due to the differences between the onsets of the diseases. In previous studies [51] we already investigated the influence of age and gender on the miRNA expression profile of whole blood. We did not find any statistically significant deregulated miRNAs between men and women. The miRNA with the lowest Pvalue was hsa-miR-423 (Pvalue 0.78). To test for the influence of age we compared the profiles obtained from old versus young patients by splitting the total group in half based on the age. Here, the miRNA with the lowest Pvalue was hsa-miR-890 (Pvalue 0.87). Again, we did not find any deregulated miRNAs. In summary, we found no evidence that age and gender have a substantial influence on the miRNA profiles. Both miRNAs mentioned above were not significant in the present study on AD., Here we identified 140 unique differentially expressed miRNAs between AD patients and healthy controls. Using a signature of 12 miRNAs differentially expressed between AD patients and healthy controls we were not only able to distinguish with high diagnostic accuracies between AD patients and healthy controls, but also between AD patients and patients suffering from other neurological disorders including mild cognitive impairment as a potential preliminary stage of AD, and other neurodegenerative diseases like PD and multiple sclerosis as well as mental diseases like SCHIZ, DEP, and BD. However, additional work will be needed to elucidate the applicability of this 12-miRNA signature as a potential diagnostic test for AD and the above-mentioned effects of the drug treatments commonly used in the treatment of the disease. Hopefully, tests of this non-invasive and relatively cheap kind will be applicable to prodromal AD cases and to MCI patients with the aim to recognize early AD to initiate treatment."
"83","The strength of genetic interactions scales weakly with mutational effects","Andrea Velenich, Jeff Gore","Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Andrea Velenich","velenich@mit.edu","26 July 2013","Genetic interactions pervade every aspect of biology, from evolutionary theory, where they determine the accessibility of evolutionary paths, to medicine, where they can contribute to complex genetic diseases. Until very recently, studies on epistatic interactions have been based on a handful of mutations, providing at best anecdotal evidence about the frequency and the typical strength of genetic interactions. In this study, we analyze a publicly available dataset that contains the growth rates of over five million double knockout mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae., We discuss a geometric definition of epistasis that reveals a simple and surprisingly weak scaling law for the characteristic strength of genetic interactions as a function of the effects of the mutations being combined. We then utilized this scaling to quantify the roughness of naturally occurring fitness landscapes. Finally, we show how the observed roughness differs from what is predicted by Fisher's geometric model of epistasis, and discuss the consequences for evolutionary dynamics., Although epistatic interactions between specific genes remain largely unpredictable, the statistical properties of an ensemble of interactions can display conspicuous regularities and be described by simple mathematical laws. By exploiting the amount of data produced by modern high-throughput techniques, it is now possible to thoroughly test the predictions of theoretical models of genetic interactions and to build informed computational models of evolution on realistic fitness landscapes.","Epistasis, Evolution, Fitness landscapes, Genetic interactions, Yeast","Genetic interactions [1] have shaped the evolutionary history of life on earth. They have been found to limit the accessibility of evolutionary paths [2], to confine populations to suboptimal evolutionary states and, on larger time scales, to control the rate of speciation [3]. Epistatic interactions can also be relevant to the development of complex human diseases such as diabetes [4]. Complex traits and diseases are determined by a multiplicity of genomic loci [5], whose independent effects and interactions [6] are often necessary to understand the phenotype of interest. Despite the broad implications of epistatic interactions, a quantitative characterization of their typical strength is still lacking. In this study, we consider growth rate in yeast as an example of a complex trait modulated by genetic interactions., Previous studies [7–10] on the relation between the growth effects of a mutation and its epistatic interactions have often been based on a handful of mutations, and only in recent years has anecdotal evidence started being replaced by robust statements based on large data sets. Perhaps the most impressive of these datasets is the one made publicly available with the publication of the article entitled 'The genetic landscape of a cell' by Costanzo et al. [11]. The genome of the budding yeast Saccharomyce cerevisiae includes approximately 6,000 genes, about 1,000 of which are essential. Viable mutants can be constructed by knocking out any of the approximately 5,000 non-essential genes, by reducing the expression of the essential genes, or by partially compromising the functionality of the gene products. The dataset (see Additional file 1, Figure S1) has been compiled with the growth rates of about 5.4 million double knockout mutants, a sizable fraction of all possible double knockout mutants in yeast. Supported by the Costanzo et al. dataset, we consider the fundamental question of whether mutations with larger effects have stronger genetic interactions., The Costanzo et al. dataset is publicly available [49]. The file http://sgadata_costanzo2009_rawdata_101120.txt.gz was downloaded on August 17, 2010 and analyzed with Mathematica (code available at the Gore laboratory website [50]). We restricted our analysis to double knockout mutants whose growth rates were positive numerical values and for which the growth rates of both single mutants were numerical values (see Additional file 1, Figure S1). Some genes appear in the dataset both as query and array genes; care was taken to avoid double counting., The exponentially growing intervals used for the binning of the log growth rate effects were defined as [-2n, -2n-1] for an appropriate range of integer n's. Owing to the rarity of extremely deleterious mutations, bins for positive n's contained only a few data points, while bins with large negative n's were extremely small. In the figures we reported only bins for n = -7 to 0, containing log growth rate effects ranging from -20 = -1 to -2-8 = -0.0039 or, alternatively, relative growth rate effects ranging from 2-1 = 0.5 to 2-0.0039 = 0.997. Different choices for the binning sizes and positions did not significantly alter the results of the analysis., In order to quantify the contribution of experimental uncertainty to epistasis, we generated nine randomized mock datasets. The mean level of noise-generated epistasis in these nine datasets is reported in Figure 4 (dashed lines), and we provide an extensive discussion of the choice of Student's t-distributions to generate the mock datasets from the original dataset (see Additional file 1, Supplementary text 3)., The GO database go_201207-assocdb-tables.tar.gz was downloaded from the GO site [51] on July 19, 2012. The MySQL database was queried with Python and analyzed Mathematica (code available upon request)."

These changes are hypothesized to influence the aging rate of an individual. We analyzed gene expression changes with age in abdominal skin, subcutaneous adipose tissue and lymphoblastoid cell lines in 856 female twins in the age range of 39-85 years. Additionally, we investigated genotypic variants involved in genotype-by-age interactions to understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters with age., Using a linear mixed model, differential expression with age was identified in 1,672 genes in skin and 188 genes in adipose tissue. Only two genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines showed significant changes with age. Genes significantly regulated by age were compared with expression profiles in 10 brain regions from 100 postmortem brains aged 16 to 83 years. We identified only one age-related gene common to the three tissues. There were 12 genes that showed differential expression with age in both skin and brain tissue and three common to adipose and brain tissues., Skin showed the most age-related gene expression changes of all the tissues investigated, with many of the genes being previously implicated in fatty acid metabolism, mitochondrial activity, cancer and splicing. A significant proportion of age-related changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific with only a few genes sharing an age effect in expression across tissues. More research is needed to improve our understanding of the genetic influences on aging and the relationship with age-related diseases.","Aging, gene expression, skin, adipose, brain, microarrays","Aging has been described as a progressive decline in the ability to withstand stress, damage, and disease resulting in degeneration [1, 2]. Age is also a major risk factor in the development of many diseases, although the relationship between the aging process and the etiology of age-related diseases is not fully understood. Previous gene expression studies of aging have primarily concentrated on model organisms [3] or have been confined to specific aging-associated disorders such as progeria syndromes[4]. A study of postmortem human brain tissue from 30 individuals aged 26 to 106 years [5] showed that approximately 4% of approximately 11,000 genes analyzed show a significant age-related expression change (1.5-fold or more) in individuals aged >40 years. These genes were reported to play central roles in synaptic plasticity, vesicular transport, and mitochondrial function. Another study [6]examined gene expression changes with age in healthy renal tissue removed at nephrectomy from 74 patients ranging in age from 27 to 92 years old; identifying 985 genes differentially expressed with age. More recently, a meta-analysis of age-related gene expression profiles combined multiple disparate gene expression studies in an attempt to identify common signatures of aging across both tissue and species [7]. However, to date, studies published using human tissuehave all been carried out on a limited number of samples, making them underpowered for the detection of normal age-related expression differences., The aims of this study were to determine which genes and pathways show differential expression with age in multiple tissues and to understand how the genomic regulation of gene expression alters with age. Age effect on gene expression was explored by examining expression profiles in skin, adipose tissue, and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 856 female twins agedfrom 39 to 85 yearsold (Figure 1)from the Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER study) [8].Genes significantly affected by age in skin and adipose tissues were followed upin 932 postmortembrain samples (representing from 10 brain regions) from 100 individuals;provided by the UK Brain Expression Consortium[2]. In addition, the influence of genetic variants on gene expression in aging individuals was explored by examining significant eQTL from the MuTHER dataset [9], for a genotype-by-age interaction.

                    , Aging studies from model organisms such as yeast, worms, and flies have repeatedly shown that changes in the expression of certain genes have an effect upon longevity. Although similar aging processes are likely to operate across multiple species [30], it has been much more difficult to identify longevity candidate genes in human studies [30]. A key question in human aging is to what extent a signature of aging may be detectable across tissues. Until now there has been a lack of large transcriptional profiles from the same human individuals in multiple tissues. The MuTHER study provides insight into the human aging process by interrogating the largest multiple human tissue gene expression resource to identify genes in which expression was affected by chronological age. The analysis of the skin and adipose tissues samples identified several hundred genes responsive to changes in chronological age. However, the 43 shared genes in skin and adipose tissue showed a single common identifiable pathway related to the stress response. From over 1,800 transcripts that have altered expression with age in skin and adipose tissues, 14 also had age-related differential expression in brain. The limited overlap in these two experiments may partly reflect the smaller sample size of the brain expression dataset, the differences in age range between the studies (16 to 83 years for brain samples; 39 to 85 years for MUTHER samples), or the inclusion of males in the brain samples. But it may also imply, as other studies have suggested, that the effects of age on gene transcription are tissue specific[6, 31, 32]. This hypothesis was supported by the comparison with known related aging genes from the GenAge database, which identified an overlap for a small number of aging-related genes with our data. The GenAge database was the result of a meta-analysis using age-related expression profiles from human brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle, and several expression profiles from mouse and rat; no adipose tissue or skin samples were included (Additional file, Table 1 in [7]). The limited overlap between these datasets supports the idea that molecular signatures of aging reflect predominantly a tissue-specific transcriptional response., The lack of age-related genes in transformed LCLs, suggest that the transformation to immortalize a cell line may mask or even remove the age-related signatures in gene expression. The transformation of primary B lymphocytes into LCLs requires infection by the Epstein-Barr virus which has the effect of disrupting the p53 signaling pathway in order to induce growth and survival [33]. Joehanes et al.[15] identified only five genes with age-associated expression in LCLs, including p53 itself (TP53). Although the authors attribute the lack of age-affected genes to their small sample size (n=50) and narrow age range, our analysis with a much larger sample size found even fewer age-related changes, suggesting a lack of detectable aging signature in LCLs. The analysis in the subset of fresh lymphocytes suggested an age influence in fresh lymphocytes may potentially be detectable with a larger sample size., Similarly to age-affected genes, genes with a significant GxA interaction are likely to be relevant for the general aging process. More than 300 GxA interactions have previously been identified in the model organism C. elegans[34, 35]and more than 600 have been documented in human blood and kidney [36, 37]. By focusing on SNPs with a statistically significant effect on expression (eQTL) from the MuTHER study, we were able to identify more than 1,000 genes for which a GxA interaction better explained the SNP effect in expression in skin and adipose tissue. Fewer than 10% of GxA interactions were observed in both tissues, suggesting that these changes were also tissue-specific. Model organism studies have observed that gene expression can influence the aging rate of an individual but also the aging rate of different tissues[38]. A feedback process may be involved here, where the consequences of the aging process may affect the expression of multiple genes like the expression and regulation of gene expression may affect the aging process. However, it is impossible to determine whether the gene expression changes observed were result or causative of the aging process. The GxA interactions identified the interface between tissue-specific gene expression regulation and tissue-specific aging. But resolving the potential feedback mechanism would require deeper knowledge of the regulatory process of gene expression and its relationship with the aging process. Our results, however, provide a starting point for future work in this direction., Among the 70 genes associated with GxA common to both tissues, we identified cancer-related genes, such as BARD1 and BCL7C.The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, implying that the formation of a stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression. BARD1 may also be the target of oncogenic mutations in breast or ovarian cancer and is also important for DNA repair. CLPTM1L gene, which has been implicated in susceptibility to lung cancer, had a GxA effect in both skin and fat. A recent study has shown that the TERT-CLPTM1L locus is also associated with melanoma risk [39]. This suggests that the associations of genetic variants to certain diseases, in particular the onset of cancer, are modified by chronological age-related effects. Other studies have found associations between genes expression changes with age and the development of cancer [40, 41] and while age remains the strongest risk factor for developing the vast majority of cancers, the actual relationship between the aging process and the development of cancer is complex and far from fully understood[42, 43]. We provide a description of genes affected by age in multiple tissues. Using the limited knowledge on gene functionality available on the databases, many of those genes have been associated to cancer, in some way. However, we do not talk in terms of enrichment for 'cancer genes' as we are not able to define them accurately enough to generate a set of genes to test in a statistical analysis. Are oncogenes considered the only cancer genes? What about metastasis and tumour suppressor genes? What about other genes? After all, genes involved in authophagy, cell migration, and metabolism in general are also involved in cancer, with immune-system-related genes also being relevant for this process. The distinction is still unclear making the definition of a list of 'cancer' genes difficult. Since epidemiological studies identify age as a strong and consistent risk factor for cancer, it is well accepted that both processes are related, but the actual mechanism behind is still unknown. Our study supports the idea that gene expression changes with age might be linked to the association between aging-related diseases and senescence or lack of it, as both processes share many genes. Recently this relationship has been exploited when using pro-senescence therapies for cancer treatment [44]. Although secondary effects of these therapies are still under investigation, the positive results obtained in animal models suggest that genes which expression changes with age may be relevant to understand the link between cancer and aging., Regarding cancer and aging, Serrano and Blasco (2007) suggested that an equilibrium between mechanisms diminishing cellular damage and mechanisms preventing excessive cellular proliferation is required between both processes[43]. The authors argue that the p53 pathway may be seen as an anti-aging mechanism as it is a key defense mechanism against cellular damage protecting from both aging and cancer. One effect of aging at the cellular level is reduced telomerase activity and progressive shorter telomeres in somatic cells [45]. Shortened telomeres are highly recombinogenic, leading to a genome-susceptible cancer development[46, 47]. Genomic instability driven by dysfunctional telomeres is also associated with the transition from benign to malignant tumors[48]. Conversely, telomere dysfunction also acts to induce the p53 gene to suppress tumor development by initiating cell-cycle arrest, cellular senescence or, apoptosis. Our analysis has identified several genes involved in the regulation and activity of the p53 pathway as being affected by age. In skin, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) showed an age-related expression in association with a genetic variant (rs10866530). In addition p21, a gene directly regulated by p53 and also involved in telomere-driven aging, was shown to be differentially expressed with age [49]. In brain, theZBTB16, CA9,and HEY2, genes associated to the p53 pathway directly or via SIRT1, all showed age-related expression. The activity of p53 has been shown to enhance the transcription of inhibitors of the insulin receptor pathway, preventing cell growth and division after stress signaling[50, 51] and many genes from the insulin signaling pathway have been extensively associated with longevity in multiple studies and organisms. Our results suggest that the link between aging and cancer is evident in multiple tissues through differential expression of genes with age., This study examines for the first time changes in gene expression with chronological age in multiple normal human tissues from the same individuals. While a significant proportion of age-related changes in gene expression appear to be tissue-specific, a few common genes were affected by age in a diverse range of tissues. Many of these genes are important in cell division regulation, senescence and apoptosis, processes prone to dysregulation, and potential oncogenesis with advancing age. Tissues comparison suggested that a significant proportion of age-related changes in gene expression are tissue-specific. This raises the question of to what extent age-related changes in gene expression are due to tissue aging rate differences or to tissue-specific gene expression regulation. Further interrogation of this aging-related expression and eQTL resource has the potential to unravel the complex interactions betwe enaging and gene expression regulation, as well as the link with age-related diseases. However, this may reveal that the two processes are so inextricably linked that it is difficult to consider them independently."

The process is found in diverse organisms such as Toxoplasma, Giardia, and nematodes. In Entamoeba histolytica this process cannot be induced in vitro, making it difficult to study. In Entamoeba invadens, stage conversion can be induced, but its utility as a model system to study developmental biology has been limited by a lack of genomic resources. We carried out genome and transcriptome sequencing of E. invadens to identify molecular processes involved in stage conversion., We report the sequencing and assembly of the E. invadens genome and use whole transcriptome sequencing to characterize changes in gene expression during encystation and excystation. The E. invadens genome is larger than that of E. histolytica, apparently largely due to expansion of intergenic regions; overall gene number and the machinery for gene regulation are conserved between the species. Over half the genes are regulated during the switch between morphological forms and a key signaling molecule, phospholipase D, appears to regulate encystation. We provide evidence for the occurrence of meiosis during encystation, suggesting that stage conversion may play a key role in recombination between strains., Our analysis demonstrates that a number of core processes are common to encystation between distantly related parasites, including meiosis, lipid signaling and RNA modification. These data provide a foundation for understanding the developmental cascade in the important human pathogen E. histolytica and highlight conserved processes more widely relevant in enteric pathogens.","","Conversion between distinct developmental stages is an essential part of the life cycle of many pathogens and is necessary for transmission. For enteric protozoa, the transmissible stage is the cyst, which allows survival outside of the host [1]. Understanding the molecular processes controlling stage conversion is central to the development of transmission-blocking therapies as well as novel diagnostics [2, 3]. Entamoeba histolytica causes colitis and dysentery and infects 500 million people per year worldwide [4]. The related Entamoeba invadens causes a similar invasive disease in reptiles [5]. The Entamoeba life cycle has two stages: trophozoites, which proliferate in the colon and cause disease, and non-dividing, multinucleate cysts that are transmitted to new hosts [6]., Research into the molecular basis of conversion between these two forms has been hampered by the absence of tools to induce encystation and excystation in in vitro axenic cultures of E. histolytica [7, 8]. Clinical E. histolytica isolates maintained in xenic culture are capable of stage interconversion and have been used to examine the transcriptome of E. histolytica cysts [9]. However, the percentage of cells forming cysts is low and stage conversion is asynchronous [10]. While interesting developmentally regulated genes were identified, the inability to isolate cysts at different developmental stages likely prevented the discovery of many important regulators of encystation., Due to the lack of in vitro methods for studying encystation in E. histolytica, the reptile parasite E. invadens has been utilized as a model system to study development. The IP-1 strain was originally isolated from a natural infection of a painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, and is pathogenic in snakes [5]. E. invadens IP-1 can form cysts in axenic culture and methods have been developed to induce high efficiency encystation and excystation in vitro [6, 11]. Using this system, many features of cyst wall biosynthesis have been elucidated [12, 13] and several compounds that enhance or inhibit encystation have been identified, including protein kinase C inhibitors and cytochalasins [14–16], suggesting that these pathways may be involved in regulating development. Recently, genetic tools have been developed to allow stable protein expression in E. invadens [17, 18], further enhancing its usefulness as a model system., Genome-wide transcriptional profiling using microarrays has been an important tool for increasing our understanding of parasite stage conversion [19–21]. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have allowed development of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), in which an entire transcriptome (reviewed in [22]) is sequenced and relative expression of each transcript deduced from read frequencies. In this paper we present the genome assembly and annotation of E. invadens IP-1, RNA-Seq analysis of transcriptional changes during the complete developmental cycle (encystation and excystation), and the functional demonstration that perturbation of the phospholipase D (PLD) pathway inhibits stage conversion in Entamoeba. Our findings demonstrate major changes in gene expression during encystation and excystation in Entamoeba, and provide insight into the pathways regulating these processes. A better understanding of processes regulating stage conversion may guide targeted interventions to disrupt transmission., Encystation and excystation are vital for dispersal and pathogenicity in some of the most important intestinal pathogens affecting humans, including Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Entamoeba, and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention has recently been highlighted [87]. However, encysting organisms can be very distantly related and it is unlikely that they have conserved many of the mechanistic features of the process over these long evolutionary periods; rather, these similarities may represent convergent adaptation to analogous lifestyles and environments. By understanding the similarities between these processes, we can begin to understand common selective forces acting on these parasites and potentially common therapeutic targets. The genomic and transcriptomic data described in this paper will lay the foundation for functional studies of the developmental cycle in Entamoeba. Our study has shown a number of important similarities between the processes in Giardia and Entamoeba, including down-regulation of basic metabolic processes [88, 89], meiotic division, and involvement of Myb domain transcription factors and lipid signaling pathways. We have also described potential signaling mechanisms that could be involved in triggering the encystation process. These genome-wide datasets lay the groundwork for future mechanistic dissection of the developmental cascade and identification of new targets for diagnostic or treatment approaches."

GLiMMPS takes into account the individual variation in sequencing coverage and the noise prevalent in RNA-seq data. Analyses of simulated and real RNA-seq datasets demonstrate that GLiMMPS outperforms competing statistical models. Quantitative RT-PCR tests of 26 randomly selected GLiMMPS sQTLs yielded a validation rate of 100%. As population-scale RNA-seq studies become increasingly affordable and popular, GLiMMPS provides a useful tool for elucidating the genetic variation of alternative splicing in humans and model organisms., Alternative splicing (AS) is the process by which exons from precursor mRNA transcripts are differentially included during splicing, resulting in different mature mRNA isoforms from a single gene locus [1]. AS is a major contributor to the control of gene expression and protein diversity. More than 90% of human genes are alternatively spliced [2]. Changes in the relative ratio of alternatively spliced isoforms of a single gene can have significant phenotypic consequences and cause various diseases [3, 4]., The control of AS is mediated through extensive protein-RNA interactions involving cis regulatory elements and trans acting factors [5]. Genetic polymorphisms that alter cis splicing regulatory elements can result in difference of alternative splicing among human individuals and subsequently affect gene expression or protein activity. Increasing evidence suggests that such natural variation of alternative splicing can influence complex traits or modify disease risks [6]. For example, genetic variation of alternative splicing in the sodium channel gene SCN1A can influence the response to antiepileptic drugs [7]. To date, most genome-wide surveys of alternative splicing variation in human populations were carried out on the HapMap lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LCLs), whose genomic variants have been extensively characterized by the HapMap [8] and 1000 Genomes projects [9]. The first few studies utilized the Affymetrix exon array with approximately 6 million exon-targeted probes [10–12]. In these studies, the microarray probe intensities of individual exons were compared to those of whole genes to quantify exon inclusion levels and then associations with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested to identify splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (sQTLs). Another study used the same exon array platform to characterize tissue-specific control of alternative splicing in brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples [13]. These studies have shed light on the prevalence and functional importance of alternative splicing variation in human populations. The development of the high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has provided a powerful alternative to splicing sensitive microarray for exon level expression quantification. RNA-seq has several advantages compared to microarray, including a greater dynamic range of exon expression levels, the ability to detect novel transcripts not probed on the array, the ability to better quantify exon inclusion levels, single nucleotide level resolution, and less confounding effects from polymorphisms on the target exons [14, 15]. Several studies have used the RNA-seq technology to characterize transcriptome variation in HapMap LCLs at the whole-gene and/or individual exon level. Pickrell et al. and Montgomery et al. used low-coverage (4-25 million short reads per individual) single-end and paired-end RNA-seq to characterize gene expression and splicing in LCLs derived from 69 Nigerian [16] and 60 CEU (Utah residents of European descent from CEPH-Centre d'Etude du Polymporphisme Humain) [17] individuals. Cheung et al. independently generated an RNA-seq dataset on 41 CEU individuals at a deeper coverage of 28.4-66 million single-end reads per individual, although the authors restricted their data analysis to expression QTLs [18]., Despite the novel findings in these pioneering RNA-seq studies, the statistical models applied for sQTL detection were simple linear regression models (lm) and did not model all the relevant information contained in the complex RNA-seq data. Montgomery et al. used the exon read counts as the phenotype and carried out spearman correlation analysis with the genotypes [17], while Pickrell et al. used the percentage of the exon read counts over total gene read counts as the quantitative trait and carried out linear regression over genotypes [16]. Neither approach directly estimated the percent inclusion levels of target exons. Moreover, by treating the exon expression measurement as a point estimate, neither approach considered the variability of RNA-seq read count that strongly affects the uncertainties in estimates of exon splicing activities [14]. Here we report a novel method GLiMMPS (Generalized Linear Mixed Model Prediction of sQTL) for robust detection of sQTLs from RNA-seq data. The GLiMMPS model takes into account the individual variation of exon-specific read coverage as well as the prevalent overdispersion of simple statistical models when applied to RNA-seq data [19, 20]. Importantly, GLiMMPS uses the reads information from both exon inclusion and skipping isoforms to model the estimation uncertainty of exon inclusion level, instead of treating the exon inclusion level as a point estimate in sQTL analysis (see Materials and methods and Figure 1 for details). Using both simulated and real RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that GLiMMPS outperforms competing statistical models (linear model and generalized linear model), and identifies sQTLs at a low false positive rate as indicated by extensive RT-PCR tests.

                    , We have developed GLiMMPS, a generalized linear mixed model to detect genotype-splicing associations from RNA-seq data. The key advantage of GLiMMPS over previously used methods is that it models: (1) variation in exon-specific read coverage across individuals; and (2) overdispersion in RNA-seq read counts. Both issues are important for accurate exon-level expression quantitation. The coverage of RNA-seq reads for any given alternative exon is a critical factor for the precision of the exon inclusion level estimate [14, 56]. The importance of accounting for overdispersion in RNA-seq data analysis has also been well recognized [57]. Methods based on the negative binomial model [58, 59] or the generalized linear model with Cox-Reid dispersion estimators [19, 20] have been developed for modeling dispersion in detecting differential gene or exon expression between biological states. Here in the sQTLs analysis, by modeling these two levels of variation in RNA-seq read counts, GLiMMPS achieves superior performance over competing statistical models, as demonstrated by analyses of simulated and real RNA-seq data. Importantly, even at a low coverage we observed a high level of concordance in the GLiMMPS results between the two human datasets (CEU and CEU2). Additionally, RT-PCR tests of 26 randomly selected significant sQTLs yielded a validation rate of 100%. Together, these results demonstrate that GLiMMPS is a robust and improved method to detect sQTLs from RNA-seq data., Fine-scale analysis of sQTLs reveals positional features of SNPs that alter exon splicing. We found that the location of the SNPs is strongly correlated with potential impact on splicing (Figure 4b). Specifically, SNPs located within the 5' and 3' splice sites have the smallest (most significant) overall GLiMMPS P values, consistent with the importance of the splice sites in exon recognition during pre-mRNA splicing. Interestingly, the significance level of sQTLs is positively correlated with the proximity of the sQTL signal SNPs to target exons. As we increased the significance level cutoff for sQTLs, we observed a progressive increase of the proportion of sQTLs with at least one significant signal SNP within 300 bp of the splice sites (Figure 4a). The causal roles of these proximal sQTL SNPs on exon splicing were further confirmed by minigene splicing reporter assays. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that the majority of cis regulatory information controlling alternative splicing is encoded in close proximity (for example, within 300 bp) of the target exons, consistent with a recent analysis of the mammalian splicing code [60]. Nonetheless, it should also be noted that 20% of the significant sQTLs (FDR ≤0.1) lack any significant signal SNP within 300 bp of the splice sites, including sQTLs confirmed experimentally by RT-PCR (in NCAPG2 and PIGQ, see Figure S6 in Additional file 1). For such sQTLs, it is possible that the causal SNPs are indeed proximal, but are missing from current SNP annotations or fail to reach the significance level cutoff due to small sample size. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small fraction of sQTLs are indeed due to SNPs disrupting distal splicing regulatory elements, given that the physical binding sites of splicing factors on the pre-mRNA can be located deep into the introns [61]. In the future, it would be interesting to confirm the identity and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of causal sQTL SNPs acting in introns distal to target exons., The detection of sQTLs is useful for interpreting signals from GWAS studies. Despite the success of GWAS in revealing the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, elucidating the mechanistic implications of GWAS findings remains a major challenge [29]. As many functional SNPs may affect gene expression and regulation instead of the final protein sequence, integrating transcriptome information with GWAS signals has proven to be an effective approach for pinpointing the functional causal variants underlying GWAS signals [62–64]. Here, from the CEU RNA-seq dataset we identified 140 unique sQTLs, including 10 significantly linked to previously identified GWAS signals (Table 1). This is probably only scratching the surface of trait-associated sQTLs, due to the low sequencing depth (28.4-66 million single-end reads per individual) and the small sample size (41 individuals). We anticipate that with more and deeper RNA-seq data generated for diverse human tissues and cell types, the catalog of sQTLs linked to phenotypic traits and diseases will rapidly expand in the near future., The GLiMMPS framework provides the basis for several aspects of future extensions. Currently, GLiMMPS uses reads mapped to splice junctions to estimate exon inclusion levels. This is a commonly used approach in alternative splicing quantitation from RNA-seq data [56, 65, 66]. However, with proper normalization for lengths of isoform-specific segments, it is feasible to also incorporate reads mapped within the exons, which may further improve the power in detecting sQTLs. This could be particularly useful for strand-specific RNA-seq, where the origins of exon body reads can be unambiguously assigned to sense or antisense transcripts. Additionally, in paired-end RNA-seq data with tight distribution of insert size, reads that map to flanking constitutive exons can also provide useful information about the exon inclusion level [14]. Furthermore, RNA-seq reads often display non-uniform distribution along mRNA transcripts due to sequence-specific bias in RNA sequencing, and several methods have been developed to model and correct for such biases [67–70]. In principle, we can use a suitable bias correction method to adjust the raw RNA-seq read counts, prior to analysis by GLiMMPS. However, we tested two well-known bias correction methods [67, 68] using a deep RNA-seq dataset with matching quantitative RT-PCR data for over 100 exons in two cell lines [66, 71], but did not observe improvement in the RNA-seq estimates of exon inclusion level as judged by the correlation of RNA-seq estimates with the RT-PCR measurements. Another area of improvement is to consider the potential impact of specific SNPs on exon splicing as the prior in the statistical model, an idea previously used for detecting expression QTLs [72–74]. For example, our results show a significant association between the SNP position and the potential impact on splicing (Figure 4), with SNPs located in the 5' and 3' splice sites most likely to influence exon splicing. It is possible to incorporate such positional information or more advanced predictive models of exon splicing [60] as the prior information to guide the detection of sQTLs., RNA-seq has become a powerful and increasingly affordable technology for population-scale analysis of transcriptome variation. Here we report GLiMMPS, a robust statistical method for detecting splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) from RNA-seq data. GLiMMPS is applicable to all major patterns of alternative splicing events. The GLiMMPS source code and user manual are freely available for download at [75]. As the cost of high-throughput sequencing continues to decline, we anticipate that combined sequencing of genomes and transcriptomes will become a popular design in large-scale studies of traits and diseases. GLiMMPS provides a useful tool for genome-wide identification of sQTLs from population-scale RNA-seq datasets."

Its vast complexity is exemplified by the recent identification of an unusual and notable component of the transcriptome - very long intergenic non-coding RNAs, termed vlincRNAs., Here we identify 2,147 vlincRNAs covering 10 percent of our genome. We show they are present not only in cancerous cells, but also in primary cells and normal human tissues, and are controlled by canonical promoters. Furthermore, vlincRNA promoters frequently originate from within endogenous retroviral sequences. Strikingly, the number of vlincRNAs expressed from endogenous retroviral promoters strongly correlates with pluripotency or the degree of malignant transformation. These results suggest a previously unknown connection between the pluripotent state and cancer via retroviral repeat-driven expression of vlincRNAs. Finally, we show that vlincRNAs can be syntenically conserved in humans and mouse and their depletion using RNAi can cause apoptosis in cancerous cells., These intriguing observations suggest that vlincRNAs could create a framework that combines many existing short ESTs and lincRNAs into a landscape of very long transcripts functioning in the regulation of gene expression in the nucleus. Certain types of vlincRNAs participate at specific stages of normal development and, based on analysis of a limited set of cancerous and primary cell lines, they appear to be co-opted by cancer-associated transcriptional programs. This provides additional understanding of transcriptome regulation during the malignant state, and could lead to additional targets and options for its reversal.","vlincRNA, LTR, macroRNA, cancer, embryonic stem cell, non-coding RNA, intelligent scaffold, single molecule sequencing, RNAseq","Over the past 10+ years, efforts to understand the complexity of the human transcriptome have employed a number of independent technologies to discover and characterize the extent of transcription from non-coding regions [1–4]. While little doubt remains about the existence of this ""dark matter"" RNA, as highlighted by the recent ENCODE papers [5, 6], its function and biological significance continues to generate controversy [3, 7–11]. Much of the problem stems from an insufficient theoretical basis to classify and categorize the dark matter transcripts, and thus they can appear as transcriptional 'noise' made by the cell. Another part of the problem arises from our genome's large number of repetitive sequences of retroviral origin. The presence of so many of these poorly conserved elements is often mentioned to support the notion that the non-coding portion of the genome has little function., Recently, by profiling total RNA depleted of ribosomal RNAswith single-molecule sequencing (SMS), we revealed an intriguing phenomenon: the presence of very long (50 to ~700 kb) transcribed regions of human non-coding intergenic genomic space [12]. These regions, dubbed vlincRNAs for very long intergenic non-coding regions, were found in tumors, and showed highly cell-type specific expression patterns. Unlike many non-coding RNAs with low levels of expression, RNAs produced from these novel vlincRNA regions were relatively abundant by mass in the cell [12]. The length of these regions emerged as a prominent feature, which, together with an absence of any obvious coding potential, made them similar to macroRNAs such as Airn or KCNQ1OT1, yet distinct from the previously identified long-intergenic ncRNAs (lincs) [13]. MacroRNAs are very long, un-spliced RNAs driven by canonical RNA Pol II promoters that function in the maintenance of imprinting in normal tissues [14, 15]. However, only a few characterized examples of macroRNAs exist, leading to the belief that they occur only rarely in the human genome [14, 15]., Here we show that vlincRNAs encode functional RNAs whose combined properties parallel those of the macroRNAs except that they criss-cross our genome in very large numbers. Regulated by relatively few dedicated promoters, these very large transcripts account for much of the dark matter transcription in the cell. Strikingly, we show that retroviral repeats, the quintessential dark matter of the genome, tend to specifically associate with tissue-specific vlincRNAs. This association occurs in both transformed and pluripotent cells, pointing to yet another un-anticipated link between pluripotency and malignancy., In this study, we show that transcription from very long stretches of genomic space, often devoid of any known genes, exists as a common and yet un-recognized property of human cells. Extrapolating from the set of samples used here to identify vlincRNAs, this class of transcript could have much greater numbers and importance than previously anticipated. In fact, it's conceivable that by profiling a larger number of cell types, we will find that vlincRNAs emanate from most of the genome. Length stands out as a unique property of these sequences, with some of them reaching over 1MB (see Additional File 1, Table S1). At least in some cases, the transcripts are made as one whole RNA molecule (see Additional File 2, Figure S3; Lazorthes et. al., manuscript in preparation). As we show here, elements bearing chromatin marks of bona fide human promoters appear to regulate these vlincRNA regions. Notably, vlincRNAs encode functional RNA species: depletion of vlincRNA transcripts in this study has measurable phenotypic effects. In addition, all human samples profiled to date express vlincRNAs, including normal primary and embryonic stem cells and a normal human tissue, blood. Still, it is worth noting here that most of our conclusions were obtained utilizing a limited number of cell lines, and thus need to be further validated on an expanded set of primary tissues, both normal and cancerous., VlincRNAs show statistically-significant association with SNPs associated with diseases in GWAS studies. In this respect, the recent work of van Dijk et. al. implicates a 205 kb vlincRNA to HELLP syndrome [30]. This HELLP vlincRNA completely overlaps one of our vlincRNAs, however our data suggests a longer and more complex locus (data not shown, see Additional File 1, Table S1). Remarkably, that study showed that point mutations linked to the disease could affect stability of the vlincRNA and result in downstream functional consequences. These findings should signal re-evaluation of the results of GWAS studies where disease-associated variants are often found outside of known genes., All this begs the question of what such huge transcripts could be doing. While some of these vlincRNA regions could possibly produce spliced protein-coding transcripts, the long un-spliced versions of these RNAs would very unlikely code for proteins, especially considering that, for the most part, they localize to the nucleus (data not shown). Instead, these RNAs likely participate in the regulation of gene expression. Indeed, one such vlincRNA was shown to be critical for maintenance of the senescent state probably by altering expression of neighboring genes via epigenetic control of chromatin state (Lazorthes et. al., manuscript in preparation). These properties make vlincRNA regions similar to macroRNAs which were previously associated only with the regulation of imprinting [14, 15]. However, until now, studies have recognized the presence of only a handful of such macroRNAs, limited to just six imprinted loci (Igf2r, Igf2, Kcnq1, Pws/As, Gnas and Dlk1) in the human and/or mouse genomes [14, 15]. Our results suggest that gene regulation via vlincRNAs and macroRNAs could be a general theme in human cells. As recently suggested, these transcripts may function as a type of scaffold to facilitate regulatory or other processes happening in the nucleus, [31]. In this respect, the abundance of these transcripts relative to annotated coding mRNAs is noteworthy. Either the relative ratio of molecules of the two types of RNA, or mass of RNA represented by them can describe their abundance. If these very long molecules function as complex scaffolds, then the amount of RNA (mass) is also an important measure of their importance in a cell. We estimate that in K562 the average molar ratio of vlincRNA transcripts is 10-20 times lower than that of protein-coding transcripts, however, the average absolute mass of vlincRNAs is roughly 5 times higher than protein-coding transcripts., Perhaps the most striking result comes from the association of tissue-specific vlincRNAs and LTR-based promoters. While cell-type specific promoters in general tend to be somewhat enriched in LTR sequences, the promoters of cell-type specific vlincRNAs demonstrate a much greater enrichment. The number of LTR-driven vlincRNAs correlates with certain cellular states. Specific activation of these very long non-coding transcripts controlled by LTR-based promoters connects stem cells with cancerous cells, both sharing a high potential for cell division. In this respect, it's reminiscent of very recent studies showing the prominent importance of cancer stem cells in disease [32–34]. It's tantalizing to speculate that these RNAs could participate in the complex machinery that supports the pluripotent-like properties of cancerous cells., Activation of ERVs in some cancers has been observed previously. These studies have focused mostly on RNAs and proteins encoded by ERVs [35, 36]. However, no connection has been made to the global importance of cellular non-coding RNAs, particularly vlincRNAs, driven by promoters embedded in ERVs or their LTRs in disease. Here we provide evidence that these cellular transcripts, rather than the LTRs themselves, constitute another component mediating the function of ERVs in pluripotency and malignancy. Exaptation of endogenous LTRs to serve as primary or alternative promoters of known genes is a well-documented phenomenon [22]. However, it seems that in most of the well characterized cases, the LTR promoter either contributes a minor effect in alternative regulation of the target gene or recapitulates the expression pattern conferred by the primary promoter [22]. The notable exception to this rule is specific redirection of expression to placenta [22]. Our results seem to suggest yet another paradigm, where the endogenous LTRs were exapted to serve as cell-type specific primary promoters of a class of non-coding RNAs, and this effect is most pronounced in pluripotent and malignant cells., A general theme in the LTR transcriptional activation observed here is that only a very specific subset of LTRs function as promoters in any given cell line (Table 2), arguing against a genome-wide global activation of this type of sequence. For example, stem cells themselves could theoretically produce non-functional vlincRNAs due to their more open chromatin structure [37]. However, only a tiny fraction (< 0.1%) of all LTR sequences are active promoters specific to the H1-hEsc cell line, and only a fraction of those drive vlincRNA expression - a situation very different from non-specific, genome-wide activation of transcription. Still this activation is non-random as indicated by detection of vlincRNAs and their promoters in different biological replicas of the same cell line using different techniques. While we have shown that LTR-promoters of vlincRNAs do indeed have strong promoter activity in reporter-gene assays, their DNA sequence alone does not recapitulate the cell-type specificity found in vivo. Thus, it's likely that some other mechanisms such as epigenetic control define the specificity of LTRs. In fact, the epigenetic status of tissue or cell specific LTR promoters has been shown modulate their activation and repression [38–42]. Furthermore, tumor-specific alterations in DNA methylation of some repeat elements have been reported [43]., Finally, our results connect two genomic features typically considered ""junk DNA"": endogenous viral sequences, specifically LTRs, and non-coding, intergenic portions of the genome often with little annotation, the so-called ""gene desert"" regions. However, their specific activation in pluripotent and cancer cells combined with siRNA-based studies suggest that the conventional wisdom of ignoring these features should be revisited. Interestingly, enrichment of different LTR elements in vlincRNA promoters distinguishes the various cell lines. Even with the small number of cell lines analyzed here, some clear differences emerge. The reason behind these differences and their biological implications offers an interesting direction for future investigation., We show two potentially independent dimensions of functional, endogenous LTRs in the human genome: selective activation of promoter capabilities of a specific subset of LTRs in stem and cancerous cells, and association of LTR promoters with a specific functional class of very long non-coding RNAs, vlincRNAs (Figure 6). These intriguing connections shine a different light on ignored portions of the genome and highlight the question of why specific subsets of LTRs and vlincRNAs activate in very specific stages of development.

                    , Given the high abundance of vlincRNAs shown in this paper, we could speculate that much of the dark matter RNA may take the form of these huge transcripts. While the scientific community continues to look at the genome through the prism of short ESTs or lincRNAs scattered in intergenic space, our data suggests that many of these transcripts actually belong together in very long transcripts regulated by relatively few promoters. This observation could be an organizing theme in the biology of non-coding RNA regulation: very long RNAs that traverse our genome may regulate gene expression in the nucleus, spiking in early development, and capable of reactivation in the malignant cellular state.,

However, it is unclear how complex spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression driven by these elements emerge from the activity of short, transcription factor binding sequences., We describe a comprehensive promoter extension assay in which the regulatory potential of all 6 base-pair (bp) sequences was tested in the context of a minimal promoter. To enable this large-scale screen, we developed algorithms that use a reverse-complement aware decomposition of the de Bruijn graph to design a library of DNA oligomers incorporating every 6-bp sequence exactly once. Our library multiplexes all 4,096 unique 6-mers into 184 double-stranded 15-bp oligomers, which is sufficiently compact for in vivo testing. We injected each multiplexed construct into zebrafish embryos and scored GFP expression in 15 tissues at two developmental time points. Twenty-seven constructs produced consistent expression patterns, with the majority doing so in only one tissue. Functional sequences are enriched near biologically relevant genes, match motifs for developmental transcription factors, and are required for enhancer activity. By concatenating tissue-specific functional sequences, we generated completely synthetic enhancers for the notochord, epidermis, spinal cord, forebrain and otic lateral line, and show that short regulatory sequences do not always function modularly., This work introduces a unique in vivo catalog of short, functional regulatory sequences and demonstrates several important principles of regulatory element organization. Furthermore, we provide resources for designing compact, reverse-complement aware k-mer libraries.","","The activity of regulatory elements is governed by transcription factors (TFs), which bind to DNA sequences averaging 6 to 9 bp in size [1] and function in combination to achieve diverse gene expression patterns. Knowledge of the vertebrate TF repertoire and individual TF binding site (TFBS) preferences is still far from complete, due to binding-site degeneracy and the challenge of annotating functional TFBSs that may occur over a million base pairs from the transcription start site (TSS) of their target gene. Even less is known about the minimal functional elements that are sufficient to drive tissue-specific expression, and how elaborate patterns result from their interplay. Deciphering the vocabulary and grammar of the vertebrate regulatory code will enable high-resolution mapping of regulatory elements, accurate interpretation of nucleotide variation in regulatory sequences, and the design of regulatory elements to deliver genes to specific tissues for research and therapeutic purposes., Many top-down approaches are used to predict vertebrate regulatory sequences. For a subset of vertebrate TFs, motifs derived from in vitro measurements of binding affinity [2, 3] can be used to identify potential TFBSs in genomic sequences. Distinguishing which TFBSs are functional is challenging, even with the aid of evolutionary conservation [4, 5] and clustering of TFBSs [6, 7]. Techniques that combine biochemical assays with massively parallel sequencing, such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)-seq, identify potential gene-regulatory elements by measuring TF binding and open chromatin in a specific cell type on a genome-wide scale [8–17]. However, these methods only coarsely locate functional sequences and are predictive in nature, requiring downstream validation. There is evidence that regulatory signals may be short (approximately 44 bp) [18], but canonical regulatory elements identified by these techniques tend to be quite long. For example, the average size of the 846 functional elements currently listed in the VISTA enhancer browser is 1,812 bp [19]. Traditional efforts to bash larger elements for core domains [18] are effective, but are time-consuming and costly., To complement existing methods for identifying regulatory regions, it will be essential to reverse-engineer regulatory elements to reveal the fundamental units that drive complex expression patterns and the rules that govern their organization. One study that employed such an approach [20]in vitro tested 100-bp synthetic elements, each composed of tandem repeats of multiplexed 10-bp sequences, in six cell lines. Considerable differences in expression levels were observed between cell lines, consistent with the tissue-specificity of native vertebrate regulatory elements [8]. However, in vivo assays are essential to understanding how the vertebrate regulatory logic functions in a physiological environment involving multiple cell types, cellular interactions and temporal stages., Here, we developed a bottom-up approach to characterize regulatory element vocabulary by systematically cataloging the effect of each 6-bp sequence (6-mer) on a TATA-box-containing 42-bp minimal promoter using zebrafish transgenics. To make this comprehensive screen feasible in vivo, we multiplexed the 6-mers into an ultra-compact library of 184 double-stranded constructs, each 15-bp in length. The activity of each construct was then scored in 15 tissues at 24 and 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf). We identified 27 multiplexed oligomers (15%) that produced distinct, consistent expression patterns. Four such constructs with distinct expression profiles were functionally dissected to identify even shorter 9-bp sequences that match binding motifs of known TF families, suggesting a mechanism by which they achieve tissue-specificity. Removal of these functional sequences from native zebrafish enhancers reduced their activity. Functional sequences were also used to design larger completely synthetic homotypic regulatory modules that drove strong expression to specific tissues. In contrast, heterotypic combinations of synthetic concatemers revealed a non-modular grammar., In this study, we made several observations on the role of TFBS-sized sequences in gene regulation in vivo. First, we identified a considerable number of very short DNA sequences that are drivers of consistent, tissue-specific expression. A previous report carried out in various cell lines [20] suggested, as a rationale for screening concatemeric sequences, that such short sequences could not drive observable levels of transcription. Our results suggest that this is not the case, and that there exists an intermediate stage between neutral sequence and fully-fledged regulatory elements. We also showed that expression levels can be amplified in vivo through homotypic concatenation, a principle that has previously been demonstrated primarily in in vitro transient transfections [38, 42, 43]. Together, these findings suggest a potential mechanism through which short sequences could gain a toehold as minimal regulatory elements and evolve into more complex clusters., A limitation of this approach is that each multiplexed construct contains multiple k-mers, requiring further bashing to determine functional sequences. However, such functional dissection is negligible compared to what would be required for a typical enhancer of more than 1,000 bp. Furthermore, multiplexing 6-mers into 15-bp oligomers identified sequences such as 2GH12, which was the only construct to drive notochord-specific expression and could not be broken down into smaller, functional units. This result, in particular, points to the potential benefits of testing higher order k-mers, ideally without multiplexing., We additionally demonstrate that short k-mers (9 to 15 bp) are important for the proper spatiotemporal expression of a subset of distal-acting regulatory elements. Thus, even though our multiplexed sequences were generated synthetically, they harbor endogenous signals that confer tissue-specificity. Using a straightforward TFBS analysis tool and publicly available data, we identified potential interacting proteins for all four tissue-specific signals. However, these matches were not perfect, highlighting the need for more in vivo testing of short sequences., Another contribution of this work is a mathematical and computational framework for the design of ultra-compact DNA libraries with single-copy representation of pairs of reverse-complementary k-mers. We show here that the reverse complementarity of DNA can be exploited to construct an MRCC library, which is about half the size of the analogous de Bruijn sequence library and yet still maintains uniform, minimal coverage of k-mers. Traditional de Bruijn sequences have proven to be extremely useful for biological applications, including protein-binding microarrays [3], universal DNA tag systems [21] and microfluidic affinity analysis devices [22]. Our formal analysis of the structure of the de Bruijn graph induced by the reverse complementarity of DNA should aid in the advancement of these and other specialized techniques that use k-mer libraries [20, 44]. In addition, the use of programmable microarrays to generate barcoded libraries of sequences for functional testing would provide an enticing platform for applying MRCC libraries. These 'massively parallel reporter assays' (MPRAs) have so far only been used to test variants of an individual promoter or enhancer [45–47], but could be used to screen k-mer libraries on a larger scale., Extending such methodologies to higher k may aid in the discovery of drivers for tissues such as the eye, otic vesicle, and fins, which were poorly represented in the 6-mer screen. For these tissues, it is entirely possible that 6-mers are simply not sufficient to drive expression. Although our screen covered 100% of 6-mers, it only captures 32% of all 7-mers, 9% of all 8-mers, and a mere 2% of the 262,144 unique 9-mers. Such methods could be combined with transgenic lines with secondary markers for specific tissues of interest to improve annotations., Finally, as evidenced by a homotypic concatemer whose expression is affected by downstream sequences, we show that local context affects enhancer function. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that show that the function of regulatory elements is sensitive to changes of spacing and order [37–40], but could also imply that our synthetic enhancers are missing key, yet undiscovered, signals typical of endogenous enhancers. While deciphering the rules of syntax by testing individual combinations is technically challenging, this process could also be accelerated by testing rearrangements of a known enhancer in parallel, using MPRAs. One such example is the recent use of MPRA technology to characterize the regulatory logic of promoters in yeast [43]. Such large-scale functional dissections will aid in the design of synthetic regulatory elements that can drive molecules to a specified level of expression in any combination of tissues and time points., Our unique catalog of short, functional sequences is a good starting point in the search for the basic functional units contributing to regulatory element activity. These sequences could be used to improve genome annotation and to interpret the effects of non-coding genetic variants. Another application is in the design of synthetic regulatory elements that can drive expression of molecules to specific tissues and time points. Using only a small subset of the 'words' in our 6-mer regulatory catalog, we demonstrate a simple type of 'sentence' that obeys the syntactical rule of amplification through repetition. Attempts to construct more elaborate sentences revealed a non-modular grammar at the scale of TFBS-sized elements, highlighting the need for functional assays with higher throughput."
"89","Variants in exons and in transcription factors affect gene expression in trans
            ","Anat Kreimer, Itsik Pe’er","Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, Center of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Columbia University, Department of Computer Science, Columbia University","Anat Kreimer","anat.kreimer@gmail.com","11 July 2013","In recent years many genetic variants (eSNPs) have been reported as associated with expression of transcripts in trans. However, the causal variants and regulatory mechanisms through which they act remain mostly unknown. In this paper we follow two kinds of usual suspects: SNPs that alter coding regions or transcription factors, identifiable by sequencing data with transcriptional profiles in the same cohort. We show these interpretable genomic regions are enriched for eSNP association signals, thereby naturally defining source-target gene pairs. We map these pairs onto a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and study their topological properties., For exonic eSNP sources, we report source-target proximity and high target degree within the PPI network. These pairs are more likely to be co-expressed and the eSNPs tend to have a cis effect, modulating the expression of the source gene. In contrast, transcription factor source-target pairs are not observed to have such properties, but instead a transcription factor source tends to assemble into units of defined functional roles along with its gene targets, and to share with them the same functional cluster of the PPI network., Our results suggest two modes of trans regulation: transcription factor variation frequently acts via a modular regulation mechanism, with multiple targets that share a function with the transcription factor source. Notwithstanding, exon variation often acts by a local cis effect, delineating shorter paths of interacting proteins across functional clusters of the PPI network.","Computational biology, eSNPs, eQTLs, protein-protein-interaction networks, regulation, regulatory networks, systems biology, systems genetics, transcriptome","Creating the complete human regulatory map is an active field of study. Many previous studies have used genomic analyses of gene expression, binding motifs, epigenetic marks and other local features to infer regulatory interactions [1–5]. In recent years it has been established that genetic variation can contribute an additional angle to this investigation [6–9]. Formally, transcription level is considered as a quantitative trait that is altered by allelic variation with thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) reported as associated with changes in gene expression [10–13]. Such markers, called expression SNPs (eSNPs) are further found to contribute to variation of disease phenotypes and other clinically relevant traits [14–16]., Variation in genomic DNA can affect transcription in multiple ways. Most intuitively perhaps, level of transcripts in cis of an eSNP may be altered due to allelic variation in regulatory elements [17]. Alternatively, such levels may be auto-regulated by changes in protein structure that reflect variation of the sequence content of local transcripts. Therefore, cis eSNPs have been studied extensively. However, cis associations are limited in their ability to inform us regarding the network of regulatory interactions between one gene and another. This motivates more focused study of the effects of genetic variants on expression of distal transcripts (trans associations). Unfortunately, while trans eSNPs can identify downstream effects and previously un-annotated regulatory pathways, they are harder to statistically and biologically justify than cis eSNPs. From a statistical perspective, since trans eSNPs can be associated with any distal transcript, the multiple testing burden dramatically increases, thus only a small number of results is detected. From a biological perspective, more complex mechanisms are needed to explain trans associations. An example of such a mechanism is an eSNP with local cis effect on a gene which codes for a transcription factor known to regulate other genes in trans. Indeed, across multiple eSNP studies [7, 18], even when statistically significant trans or cis eSNPs associations are detected aplenty, the regulatory mechanisms by which they alter gene expression remain mostly unknown., A large fraction of SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [10] have been reported to be associated with disease phenotypes [14] despite being neither coding, nor linked to coding SNPs in cis. Furthermore, since large-scale genetic studies have been predominantly based on SNP arrays, SNP alleles that are reported as associated, in studies of either disease [10] or gene expression [7], are often merely tags for causal variants, whose identity is challenging to track down. More generally, the multitude of phenotypes for eSNPs represents an opportunity for tackling the central question of causation in association., Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks capture various experimental data, such as from yeast two-hybrid systems [19], regarding the physical binding of proteins, and are often used to examine how these interactions are involved in a specific biological function. Recently, improved data on signal transduction and metabolic and molecular networks have contributed to the fidelity and accuracy of the reconstructed PPI networks. However, the data represented by these networks can sometimes be partial and noisy. PPI networks have been modeled as theoretical graphs and their topological properties extensively studied [20–22]. This provided insights pertaining to functional, structural and evolutionary characterization of these networks, primarily in model organisms. Genetic interactions in yeast were studied in the context of protein complexes network [23], motivating the investigation of genetic variants that alter gene expression (as interactions) with respect to the human PPI network[24]. Studies of PPI networks in the context of genetic variation have thus far focused on GWAS-detected SNPs that are associated with common traits and disease, reporting that genes that harbor such SNPs frequently code for interacting proteins [24–28]. Yet, such studies only considered the PPI-network nodes that correspond to the associated SNP, without a PPI network node that would correspond to the phenotype., Here, we perform a comprehensive study of trans genetic associations and their large-scale properties as manifested on a PPI network. We use SNPs from sequencing data [29] that are candidates to be causal based on their genomic location, and then project their association to gene expression on a PPI network. We hypothesized that genes involved in true eSNP associations have distinct PPI-network properties that differ significantly from spurious genes with candidate association signals. To address this hypothesis, we focus on trans association of eSNPs in exons and transcription factors (TFs), analyzing their properties as reflected on the PPI-network topology and annotations of the genes involved. Our focus on expression quantitative traits allows consideration of paths along the PPI network, whose links with genetic variation had previously only been studied with respect to SNPs, rather than the transcripts they modulate., Our results suggest that a significant fraction of eSNPs in exons act in trans through mild effects in
                cis, with a regulation mechanism that is mediated by PPI paths that are shorter than expected by chance and tend to traverse across functional clusters of the PPI network. These paths highlight zinc ion binding genes as a possible mechanism of transcript-eSNP feedback across the PPI network. In comparison to such coding eSNPs, we observe that TFs harboring eSNPs and their associated genes create units of genes that are functionally enriched for biological annotations. This suggests a different, modular regulatory mechanism for such TF eSNPs. Altogether, our analysis offers insights concerning a variety of mechanisms by which genetic variation at functional loci shapes the structure of human regulatory networks., We present a computational approach to study the characteristics of trans regulation. We observed that candidate eSNPs within exons exhibited an overabundance of significant association signals. We consequently focused on eSNPs that resided within an exon of a source gene, and were associated with the expression level of a different gene target. We observed that candidate eSNPs within TFs were associated with a higher number of transcripts than expected by chance. We subsequently examined eSNPs that resided within the span of source TFs. We mapped these pairs of source and target onto a PPI network and analyzed their topological properties., We applied our approach to publicly available genetics and genomics [30] data from the same samples. We demonstrated that, by combining association data with information on PPI, it is possible to unravel topological properties for the two trans association types. We found that for an eSNP exon source and its gene target, the stronger the association, the closer the source-target distance and the higher the target degree in the PPI network. Expression analysis showed these source-target pairs to be frequently co-expressed, and that these exon eSNPs often had significant cis effects on the expression of the source genes. The observed phenomenon of exonic variation leaving a signature on PPI paths raises speculations regarding the mechanisms of transcription regulation. Previous studies have indirectly tackled these speculations regarding the connection between eSNP regulation and the PPI space. Specifically, Rossin et al. found that PPI connections between loci defined in GWAS of a specific disease were more densely connected than chance expectation [24], and Nicolae et al. [14] observed that SNPs found in GWAS were more likely to be eSNPs. The comprehensiveness of our work relied on combining eQTL data with the PPI network and not merely GWAS data, as described in previous studies [27]. This allowed us to examine source-target connections across the network, rather than be limited to studying the source nodes as in GWAS-PPI analyses. The novel observation is that the genetic variation that modifies PPI network properties is associated with a normal expression landscape and not only with extreme cases of disease., We attempted to go beyond topological results and shed light on the regulatory mechanism by which gene expression of the target gene is altered in these shorter paths. We systematically compared genes along real and permuted shortest paths and found enrichment for ion zinc binding proteins, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which the expression level of the target transcript is modified. More generally, the paths of interacting protein pairs, from a source protein to the target protein, were consistent with concatenation of two pathways (Figure S7 in Additional file 1). The prefix of the path was consistent with a regulatory pathway, leading to some regulatory protein (TF or other) that affects expression of the target. The suffix of the path may match a self feedback loop in reverse: from the target protein back to the same regulatory protein [46]., We demonstrated it is possible to characterize regulatory variation in TFs. We observed that eSNP TF sources and their gene targets create units of genes that are enriched for functional annotations. When decomposing the PPI network to clusters, we observed that these source-target pairs tend to reside within the same cluster., The design choices for a study of this kind convey a few methodological limitations. First, because we were interested in detecting putatively causal variants based on their exact genomic location, we used a dataset of fully sequenced individuals along with their transcription profiles. Such cohort sizes are limited in size, reducing the power to detect association and allowing us to see only the strongest effects. Second, we were interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying eSNPs interactions. This required the use of a well-established interaction network. We examined our results on a PPI network, rather than a TF-DNA interaction network or co-expression network derived from this dataset, to establish a broad and independent network of interactions. Overall, both the raw datasets [29, 30] and supporting databases [37–39, 47–49] in this work were noisy and limited. That we observed statistically significantly plausible results in such a small dataset combined with noisy databases is encouraging. Potentially, an increase in sample size may enable detection of eSNP associations at more significant P-values for even milder effects., Over the last decade, causal interpretation of genetic association signals for common variants and common traits had been impeded by two hurdles. First, many of the signals had been obtained as indirect association to proxy genetic markers, without access to the directly and causally associated variant. Second, often the trait under investigation was not understood at the molecular mechanistic level well enough to decipher the connection between variant and phenotype. This work bridges the gap between association and causality by considering both direct association to sequencing-ascertained variants, as well as expression quantitative traits. The ability to tie together these loose ends of genetic association using an interaction map constitutes a notable stride towards understanding the thousands of such connections that recent genetics have discovered., Our main findings suggest two modes of trans regulation via genetic variation in exons and TFs. Exonic variation possibly acts through mild cis effects that alter the expression of the source gene and delineates shorter paths between functional clusters (Figure 4a), and exonic eSNP targets might play an important role in the PPI network as hubs. TF variation frequently acts via a modular regulation mechanism, with multiple targets that share a function with the TF source (Figure 4b).

                    , Future studies could extend the approach presented here to investigate how genetic variation in different meaningful genomic locations (for example, enhancers, insulators, miRNAs) correlates with gene targets. Datasets that combine sequenced variants coupled with gene expression and phenotypic traits are limited in human, but available for other model organisms [50, 51]. It would be insightful to combine this type of study with phenotypic data, to see how trans association tracks with phenotypes. Specifically, applying our approach to samples under various conditions (for example, disease), could improve understanding of condition-specific regulatory processes [24]. Moreover, considering genetics-genomics data across different tissues along with a tissue-specific PPI network [52] could be telling regarding the underlying regulatory mechanisms characterizing these tissues."
"90","The advantages of SMRT sequencing","Richard J Roberts, Mauricio O Carneiro, Michael C Schatz","New England Biolabs, Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Simons Center for Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","Richard J Roberts","roberts@neb.com","3 July 2013","","","Of the current next-generation sequencing technologies, SMRT sequencing is sometimes overlooked. However, attributes such as long reads, modified base detection and high accuracy make SMRT a useful technology and an ideal approach to the complete sequencing of small genomes., So-called next-generation technologies for sequencing DNA are penetrating every aspect of biology thanks to the immense amount of information that is encoded within nucleic acid sequences. However, today's next-generation sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, 454 and Ion Torrent, have several significant limitations, especially short read lengths and amplification biases, that restrict our ability to fully sequence genomes. Unfortunately, with the rise of next-generation sequencing, even less emphasis is being placed on trying to understand at the biological and biochemical levels just what functions newly discovered genes have and how those functions allow an organism to work, which is surely why we are sequencing DNA in the first place. Now a new technology, SMRT sequencing from Pacific Biosciences [1], has been developed that not only produces considerably longer and highly accurate DNA sequences from individual unamplified molecules, but can also show where methylated bases occur [2] (and thereby provide functional information about the DNA methyltransferases encoded by the genome)., SMRT sequencing is a sequencing-by-synthesis technology based on real-time imaging of fluorescently tagged nucleotides as they are synthesized along individual DNA template molecules. Because the technology uses a DNA polymerase to drive the reaction, and because it images single molecules, there is no degradation of signal over time. Instead, the sequencing reaction ends when the template and polymerase dissociate. As a result, instead of the uniform read length seen with other technologies, the read lengths have an approximately log-normal distribution with a long tail. The average read length from the current PacBio RS instrument is about 3,000 bp, but some reads may be 20,000 bp or longer. This is roughly 30 to 200 times longer than the read length from a next-generation sequencing instrument, and more than a four-fold improvement since the original release of the instrument two years ago. It is notable that the recently announced PacBio RS II platform claims to have a further four-fold improvement, with twice the mean read length and twice the throughput of the current machine., The SMRT approach to sequencing has several advantages. First, consider the impact of the longer reads, especially for de novo assemblies of novel genomes. While typical next-generation sequencing can provide abundant coverage of a genome, the short read lengths and amplification biases of those technologies can lead to fragmented assemblies whenever a complex repeat or poorly amplified region is encountered. As a result, GC-rich and GC-poor regions, which tend to be poorly amplified, are particularly susceptible to poor quality sequencing. Resolving fragmented assemblies requires additional costly bench work and further sequencing. By also including the longer reads of SMRT sequencing runs, the read set will span many more repeats and missing bases, thereby closing many of the gaps automatically and simplifying, or even eliminating, the finishing time (Figure 1). It is becoming routine for bacterial genomes to be completely assembled using this approach [3, 4], and we expect this practice will translate to larger genomes in the near future. A complete genome is far more useful than the poor quality draft sequences that litter GenBank because it provides a complete blueprint for the organism; the genes encoded therein represent the full biological potential of that organism. With only draft assemblies available, one is always left with the nagging feeling that some crucial gene is missing - perhaps the one in which you are most interested! The long read lengths also have more power to reveal complex structural variations present in DNA samples, such as pinpointing precisely where copy number variations have occurred relative to the reference sequence [5]. They are also extremely powerful for resolving complex RNA splicing patterns from cDNA libraries, since a single long read may contain the entire transcript end-to-end, thus eliminating the need to infer the isoforms [6].

The graphs encode the compressed de Bruijn graph derived from infinite coverage error-free reads, effectively representing the repeats in the genome and the upper bound of what could be achieved in a real assembly. Increasing the read length decreases the number of contigs because the longer reads will span more of the repeats. Note the assembly with 5,000 bp reads has a self-edge because the chromosome is circular.
                    , Second, consider DNA methyltransferases. These can exist as solitary entities or as parts of restriction-modification systems. In both cases, they methylate relatively short sequence motifs that can easily be recognized from SMRT sequencing data because of the change in DNA polymerase kinetics, as it moves along the template molecule, that result from the presence of epigenetic modifications. The altered kinetics cause a change in the timing of when the fluorescent colors are observed, thus enabling direct detection of epigenetic modifications, which can ordinarily only be inferred, and bypassing the usual necessity of enrichment or chemical conversion. Often, thanks to bioinformatics, the gene responsible for any given modification can be matched to the sequence motif in which the modification lies [7, 8]. When it cannot, then simply cloning the gene into a plasmid, which is subsequently grown in a non-modifying host and re-sequenced, can provide the match [9]. Moreover, SMRT sequencing has also been able to identify RNA base modifications through the same approach as DNA base modifications, but using an RNA transcriptase in place of the DNA polymerase [10]. In fact, SMRT sequencing represents an important step toward uncovering the biology that happens between DNA and proteins, including not only the study of mRNA sequences but also the regulation of translation [11, 12]. Thus, functional information emerges directly from the SMRT sequencing approach., Third, we must consider the persistent rumor that SMRT sequencing is much less accurate than other next-generation sequencing platforms, which has now been demonstrated to be untrue in several ways. First, a direct comparison of several approaches to determining genetic polymorphisms has shown that SMRT sequencing has comparable performance to other sequencing technologies [13]. Second, the accuracy of assembling a complete genome using SMRT sequencing in combination with other technologies has proved to be as reliable and accurate as more traditional approaches [3, 6, 14]. Moreover Chin et al. [15] showed that an assembly using only long SMRT sequencing reads achieves comparable or even higher performance than other platforms (99.999% accuracy in three organisms with known reference sequences), including 11 corrections to the Sanger reference of these genomes. Koren et al. [6] showed that most microbial genomes could be assembled into a single contig per chromosome with this approach; it is by far the least expensive option for doing so., The power of SMRT sequencing data lies both in its long read lengths and in the random nature of the error process (Figure 2). It is true that individual reads contain a higher number of errors: approximately 11% to 14% or Q12 to Q15, compared with Q30 to Q35 from Illumina and other technologies. However, given sufficient depth (8x or more, say), SMRT sequencing provides a highly accurate statistically averaged consensus perspective of the genome, as it is highly unlikely that the same error will be randomly observed multiple times. Notoriously, other platforms have been found to suffer from systematic errors that need to be resolved by complementary methods before the final sequence is produced [16].
                    Figure 2
                      
                        A sequencing context breakdown of the empirical insertion error rate of the two platforms on NA12878 whole genome data. In this figure we show all contexts of size 8 that start with AAAAA. The empirical insertion quality score (y-axis) is PHRED scaled. Despite the higher error rate (approximately Q12) of the PacBio RS instrument, the error is independent of the sequencing context. Other platforms are known to have different error rates for different sequencing contexts. Illumina's HiSeq platform, shown here, has a lower error rate (approximately Q45 across eight independent runs), but contexts such as AAAAAAAA and AAAAACAG have extremely different error rates (Q30 versus Q55). This context-specific error rate creates bias that is not easily clarified by greater sequencing depth. Empirical insertion error rates were measured using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) - Base Quality Score Recalibration tool.
                    , Another approach that benefits from the stochastic nature of the SMRT error profile is the use of circular consensus reads, where a sequencing read produces multiple observations of the same base in order to generate high-accuracy consensus sequence from single molecules [17]. This strategy trades read length for accuracy, which can be effective in some cases (targeted re-sequencing, small genomes) but is not necessary if one can achieve some redundancy in the sequencing data (8x is recommended). With this redundancy, it is preferable to benefit from the improved mapping of longer inserts than opt for circular consensus reads, because the longer reads will be able to span more repeats and high accuracy will still be achieved from their consensus., The considerations above make a strong case for combining the more traditional, sequence-dense data from other technologies with at least moderate coverage of SMRT data so that genomes can be improved, their methylation patterns obtained, and the functional activity of their methyltransferase genes deduced. We would especially urge all groups currently sequencing bacterial genomes to adopt this policy. That said, SMRT sequencing has also substantially improved eukaryotic genome assemblies, and we expect it to become more widely applied in this context over time, in light of the greater read lengths and throughput of the PacBio RS II instrument., Perhaps it would even be worth redoing many genomes so that existing shotgun dataset-based assemblies could be closed and their complete methylomes obtained. The resultant assembled (epi)genomes would be inherently more valuable: the usefulness of a closed genome with associated functional annotation of its methyltransferase genes is far greater than the uncertainties left with a shotgun data set. Whereas we currently know much about the importance of epigenetic phenomena for higher eukaryotes, very little is known about the epigenetics of bacteria and the lower eukaryotes. SMRT sequencing opens a new window that may have a dramatic effect on our understanding of this biology."

Significant evidence has accumulated showing that the human transcriptome contains in excess of a hundred thousand different transcripts. However, it is still not clear to what extent this diversity prevails when considering the relative abundances of different transcripts from the same gene., Here we show that, in a given condition, most protein coding genes have one major transcript expressed at significantly higher level than others, that in human tissues the major transcripts contribute almost 85 percent to the total mRNA from protein coding loci, and that often the same major transcript is expressed in many tissues. We detect a high degree of overlap between the set of major transcripts and a recently published set of alternatively spliced transcripts that are predicted to be translated utilizing proteomic data. Thus, we hypothesize that although some minor transcripts may play a functional role, the major ones are likely to be the main contributors to the proteome. However, we still detect a non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes for which the major transcript does not code a protein., Overall, our findings suggest that the transcriptome from protein coding loci is dominated by one transcript per gene and that not all the transcripts that contribute to transcriptome diversity are equally likely to contribute to protein diversity. This observation can help to prioritize candidate targets in proteomics research and to predict the functional impact of the detected changes in variation studies.","splicing, transcriptome, gene expression, RNA-seq","Although there are fewer than 22,000 protein coding genes known in the human genome, they are transcribed into over 140,000 different transcripts (Ensembl release 66 [1]), over 65% of which have protein coding potential and thus may contribute to protein diversity. Recently, applications of high throughput sequencing to RNA, known as RNA-seq [2], have opened new avenues for the study of transcriptome composition [3]. RNA-seq is based on sequencing short fragments, thus making the precise reconstruction of full-length transcripts a difficult task; nevertheless, several methods have been developed to deconvolute transcript abundance [4–6]. Significant evidence has accumulated showing that approximately 95% of multiexon genes have more than one alternative splice-form expressed (for example, [4, 7–9]) and that transcript expression is regulated [10, 11]. On the other hand, focusing on EST data, Taneri et al. [12] predicted that there is a single dominant transcript per gene in primary tissues. Recently, the ENCODE project [13] showed that indeed, in cell lines most genes have a major transcript, although at the same time noted that 'genes tend to express many transcripts simultaneously, and as the number of annotated transcripts per gene grows, so does the number of expressed transcripts'. However, despite these observations, it is still not clear if and to what extent major transcripts are dominating the transcriptome and what proportion of the transcript diversity is likely to contribute to protein diversity. In addition, given the notable differences in gene expression between primary tissues and cell lines [11, 14], transcriptome analysis in cell lines can be extended to primary tissues only to some extent., Here we intend to characterise the potentially coding transcriptome from a functional perspective. By focusing on protein coding genes, we show that in primary tissues almost 85% of the total mRNA from protein coding loci comes from major transcripts (76% in cell lines). It is important to highlight that these major transcripts are not always the longest possible for the gene (40% of the major transcripts in primary tissues and 30% in cell lines are not the longest annotated), nor always include the longest CDS (Coding DNA Sequence; approximately 50% of the cases in both tissues and cell lines). For instance, we identified the AES gene (amino-terminal enhancer of split), for which we detect a ubiquitous major transcript that is shorter than the current reference. We also show that the ratio of the number of expressed transcripts to genes in primary tissues is on average 1.12 (that is, just over one transcript per gene). We further distinguish between: (1) major transcripts - the transcript with the highest expression level within a given gene; and (2) dominant transcripts - a major transcript that is expressed at a considerably higher level than any minor transcripts of the gene. We show that most protein coding genes in most conditions have one dominant transcript, for example, for almost 80% of the expressed genes in primary tissues the major transcript is at least twice as abundant as the next one., We further observe that about half of the ubiquitously expressed genes (n = 4,801) have the same major transcript across all the 16 tissues studied here. We do, however, detect switch events for approximately 35% of the genes, where the dominant and minor transcripts switch between different tissues, while the total expression level of the gene changes comparatively little. In around 100 genes we observe such a strong change that we can hypothesise that the different transcripts are likely to be translated into different proteins. One example is the MBP gene (Myelin Basic Protein), which is a major protein constituent of the myelin sheath. A shorter brain specific form has been detected by this analysis and has been highlighted recently in the literature [15]. Finally, we observe that for almost 20% of the studied protein coding genes (n = 18,450) the major transcript does not code for a protein, and this percentage is considerably higher in nucleus than in cytosol. Half of the noncoding major transcripts can be explained by a retained intron, typically located towards the 3'-end of the transcript., We perform the analyses using three different computational methods [4–6], and additionally, where sufficient coverage exists, we assess the alternative transcript abundances directly from the reads spanning unique exon junctions. We also use simulated data [16] to confirm that the methods can reliably distinguish between two hypothetical alternative scenarios - one dominant transcript per gene vs. several transcripts per gene expressed to similar levels. All those methods produce a consistent outcome, indicating robustness of the conclusions presented here., Overall, our results show that, despite of the diversity of the transcriptome, most protein coding genes have one dominant transcript, which, when combined, comprise most of the potentially coding mRNA transcriptome. Correlation between transcriptome and proteome is not straightforward, with the best estimates pointing at a range of 58% to 63% correlation [17]. However, the strong overlap with a set of isoforms that are independently predicted to be translated into proteins, together with the clear separation in expression levels between major and minor transcripts, add support to the hypothesis that the dominant transcripts are likely to be the main contributors to the proteome. Thus, our findings may help proteome analysis by prioritising the candidate proteins that are more likely to be present in a given sample. At the same time, identification of changes in the major transcript across conditions can lead to relevant clinical findings (for example, [18]) and may also be used to predict the functional impact of the detected changes in variation studies. Nevertheless, this does not imply that all minor transcripts do not have a biological function, since some may still be translated into proteins [19] or have a regulatory function as mRNAs [20]., Here we quantify and analyse the overall contribution of major transcripts to the potentially coding mRNA transcriptome, in comparison to minor transcripts. The datasets analysed comprise 16 primary human tissues - Illumina Body Map dataset (BM), further referred to as tissue data - and 5 ENCODE cell lines, including different cellular compartments (whole cell, cytosol and nucleus) - further referred to as cell line data (see Methods)., In this study we combine RNA-seq data from different primary tissues, cell lines and cellular compartments to characterise the human protein coding transcriptome from a functional perspective. We show that in a given condition most protein coding genes not only express one major transcript, as recently observed by Djebali et al. [13], but in most cases the major transcripts are dominating the transcriptome. This observation is accentuated when grouping transcripts by TSS, a scenario in which differences in transcript abundance can be mostly attributed to splicing. We are aware that transcript quantification from short read sequences is not a trivial task, and that the current annotation is continuously updated to include novel transcripts. However, our findings are supported by several quantification methods, including de novo transcript discovery, they are consistent across all datasets, and are reassuringly supported by direct evidence from junction reads. In addition, the single transcript dominance becomes stronger for highly expressed genes, for which transcript prediction and quantification have been reported to be more reliable (RNA-seq Genome Annotation Assessment Project - RGASP, J Harrow, T Steijger, F Kokocinski, JF Abril, C Howald, A Reymond, A Mortazavi, B Wold, T Gingeras, R Guigó, et al., in preparation). In the long term, longer reads and single cell sequencing will shed more light on the topic., Changes in alternative splicing across conditions have been widely reported, with many studies focusing on the differences across tissues ([7, 8, 20], Merkin et al. Science 2012, [24]), where splicing is thought to control the interactions of the protein products [25, 26]. Here we quantify changes in the major transcript across conditions by looking at switch events. We detect a significant number of genes that express several major transcripts across different conditions. Relevant examples include the MBP gene, PSEN1 (presenilin 1) and ILF3 (interleukin enhancer binding factor 3). However, in many cases the differences are subtle. This would suggest that alternative splicing might be more prevalent in dynamic processes such as development and differentiation, rather than steady state. On the other hand, dominant transcripts that are recurrent in many samples are also interesting, given that they can be used to build a catalogue for the reference transcriptome. A closer inspection of a set of recurrent major transcripts revealed cases where they do not contain the longest CDS, a criteria often used in resources like UniProt to define a reference transcript [27], thus exposing some of the limitations of the current definitions and pointing to potential advantages of taking into account functional data. For instance, the major transcripts detected for the AES gene and the CD47 gene are ubiquitously expressed and do not correspond to the current reference., We were surprised to find that for a non-negligible fraction of protein coding genes the major transcript is non-coding and can be classified as retained intron or processed transcript, which lack an open reading frame [28]. However, we observe higher prevalence of non-coding major transcripts in the nucleus, specifically retained introns. Evidence exists suggesting that unspliced or incompletely spliced mRNAs are confined to the nucleus [29, 30]; therefore we hypothesize that our observation could reflect incomplete splicing, as suggested by the higher expression levels of introns in nucleus. We also observe that retained introns are preferentially located towards the transcriptional end of transcripts, which has been previously linked to nonsense mediated decay [31], a control mechanism that leads to the degradation of unspliced transcripts when they are transported to the cytosol [32, 33]. Nevertheless, several cases of functionally relevant retained introns have been described, either as a mechanism to target mRNA molecules (for example, [34, 35], produce alternate protein products [36] or regulate expression levels [37–39]. We observe that genes with retained introns as the major transcript in both nucleus and cytosol are expressed at considerably lower levels in the later, which could point to a regulatory role. Finally, we also detected that those genes are associated to ribosomal components, which is consistent with previous findings indicating that introns regulate the expression of ribosomal proteins in yeast [40]. On the other hand, we were able to re-annotate some of the recurrent processed transcripts to either coding or retained intron, thus illustrating a potential application of our analyses. For example, we revisited the annotation for one of the transcripts from PARK7 (parkinson protein 7) to protein coding, from RNF40 (ring finger protein 40) to nonsense mediated decay and from OSBPL2 (oxysterol binding protein-like 2) to retained intron., Overall, it is difficult to predict the impact of our observations at the protein level. There have been several studies addressing the relationship between protein and transcript levels, which in general point at a modest, but not insignificant correlation [17, 21, 41, 42]. Translational efficiency, mRNA and protein turnover rates are likely to have an impact on protein levels [21]. On the other hand, proteomics studies also show that observing a protein is unlikely unless there are at least a certain number of RNA molecules per cell [21–23]. This may be partly due to insufficient sensitivity of the methods used; nevertheless this supports the hypothesis that the abundance of proteins corresponding to minor transcripts is likely to be lower than the one corresponding to dominant transcripts. We evaluated this hypothesis by overlapping our set of dominant transcripts with a set of transcripts predicted to be translated into proteins by entirely independent means [43]. We detected a considerably larger overlap for those transcripts that have a tendency to be identified as major, compared to minor ones, suggesting that major transcripts could be preferentially translated. On the other hand, alternative splicing not only has an impact on the proteome repertoire [44–46], but also at the transcriptome level, cooperating in the control of expression levels [20, 32, 47] and contributing to spatial expression patterns through transcript localisation [46]. This brings in other potential roles for minor transcripts. However, it is also possible that some of those minor transcripts are simply the result from noisy splicing [22, 45, 48]., The discovery of alternative splicing and many different classes of non-coding RNAs, together with the establishment of RNA-seq, revealed that the number of transcripts exceeds many times the number of genes in the human genome. This has been used to argue that alternative splicing possibly explains the low number of genes compared to what was believed before it was sequenced [45]. Despite this diversity of transcripts, our findings indicate that most protein coding genes express one dominant transcript in a given condition and that most of the mRNA pool from protein coding loci arises from major transcripts, thus suggesting that those could be the main contributors to the proteome. In addition, the ratio of the number of expressed transcripts to genes in primary tissues is on average 1.12 and many of the dominant transcripts are the same across different conditions. Overall, these observations may help proteome analysis by prioritising the candidate proteins that are more likely to be present in a given sample. At the same time, identification of changes in the major transcript across conditions can lead to relevant clinical findings (for example, [18]) and may also be used to predict the functional impact of the detected changes in variation studies."

Targeting nucleases have been successfully used to edit genomes. However, whole-locus or element-specific deletions abolishing transcript expression have not previously been reported. Here, we show heritable targeting of locus-specific deletions in the zebrafish nodal-related genes squint (sqt) and cyclops (cyc). Our strategy of heritable chromosomal editing can be used for disease modeling, analyzing gene clusters, regulatory regions, and determining the functions of non-coding RNAs in genomes., Genome editing tools such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) have revolutionized the fields of biotechnology, gene therapy and functional genomic studies in many organisms [1–4]. However, engineering large chromosomal deletions in vertebrates has been largely restricted to mice, where the typical strategy used is gene targeting, and subsequently, specific regions are engineered by site-specific recombination systems such as the Cre/Lox or Flp/FRT systems [5]. Although site-specific recombination has been used successfully to analyze the functions of genes involved in embryonic development, cancer and other diseases, this strategy is time, labor and resource intensive. Hence, rapid and facile methods to engineer chromosomes are of immense value., Analysis of regulatory elements in the genome, and determining the activity and functions of gene clusters require generation of chromosomal lesions. Although large chromosomal lesions have been generated by gamma ray treatment and other methods, these lesions are often accompanied by complex rearrangements affecting several loci, which is a limitation for precise analysis of specific genomic regions or regulatory elements. In addition, the size and position of the re-arrangements cannot be predetermined by these methods [6, 7]. Therefore, precise and easy techniques to generate segmental mutations at desired locations on chromosomes would be useful for analysis of gene clusters and large regulatory regions in the genome., Recent genome-wide transcriptome analyses in cells and organisms have identified several non-coding and novel coding RNAs. However, determining their functions requires the generation of RNA-null alleles [8]. The TALEN and ZFN technologies have been used successfully in many organisms to generate small insertion and deletion mutations at target sites of specific genes [3, 9–11]. Large chromosomal deletions and inversions have been shown in cell lines using ZFNs, and deletions using two pairs of TALENs have been generated in silkworm, swine fibroblasts and zebrafish [12–16]. So far, however, heritable chromosomal deletions that specifically abolish expression of a transcript have not been reported with these nucleases in any organism. Thus, rapid and easy methods to generate whole-locus, element-specific or transcript-specific deletions would greatly facilitate functional genomic studies., Here, we report a simple, effective and rapid strategy to generate a whole locus deletion in zebrafish, by the simultaneous use of two pairs of TALENs or TALEN pairs in conjunction with ZFN pairs, that we used successfully to precisely delete the nodal-related gene sqt and generate sqt RNA-null alleles. We also report targeted deletions in a second zebrafish nodal gene, cyclops (cyc), for which gamma ray- and chemically induced chromosomal rearrangements and point mutations were reported, but a precise locus-specific deletion was not available [6, 17–23]. Our strategy of heritable chromosomal editing can potentially be applied for functional genomic studies in a variety of organisms., To test if large deletions can be generated efficiently by using multiple TALENs, we first targeted the reporter gene encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). We designed and synthesized two TALEN pairs spaced approximately 600 bp apart to target egfp sequences [9, 24] (black arrows in Figure 1a). Each TALEN pair was tested individually and in combinations, at various doses, by injecting transgenic zebrafish embryos (Tg (Ds DELGT4)
                sg310
                ) with ubiquitous and robust EGFP expression (Figure 1b). Injected embryos were assessed for abnormalities or lethality, and for EGFP expression. The cutting efficiency of each TALEN pair was estimated by T7 endonuclease I (T7E1) assay on ten individual injected embryos (Table 1) and calculated by sequencing pooled PCR amplicons from the embryos (Figure S1A,D,H in Additional file 1). Higher doses of egfp TALEN pairs resulted in increased numbers of abnormal embryos and lethality (Table 2). Loss of EGFP expression was observed at 30 hours post-fertilization (hpf) in sectors of the eyes and neural tube of egfp TALEN-injected embryos (Figure 1c). Thus, the injected egfp TALEN pairs induce mutations in egfp and effectively disrupt EGFP expression in embryos.

(d) PCR with primers spanning the TALEN targeting sites (blue and magenta triangles in (a)) shows the expected 250 bp truncated egfp and 854 bp full-length egfp products in individual embryos injected with egfp TALEN pairs, whereas only the full-length product is observed in the un-injected control embryo. No template control is indicated by -g. (e) Alignment of wild-type (WT) egfp sequences with mutated PCR amplicons shows various deletions of approximately 600 bp between the targeting sites, accompanied by small insertions (red).
                    , PCR with primers flanking the TALEN sites (Figure 1a, blue and magenta triangles) shows an approximately 250 bp fragment in all injected embryos (n = 23), compared to a 854 bp wild-type egfp fragment, indicating excision of intervening sequences in some cells of injected embryos (Figure 1d). Sequencing of PCR products from individual embryos showed large as well as small deletions, likely due to mosaicism of the injected nuclease RNA pairs, and non-homologous end joining events (Figure 1e; Figure S1B,C,E in Additional file 1). Comparison of sequences of single TALEN versus double TALEN pair injections shows lower deletion frequency with single TALEN pair injections, presumably because small deletions induced by single nuclease pairs are repaired more efficiently than the larger lesions induced by multiple TALEN pairs (Figure S1A-E,H in Additional file 1). Moreover, the majority of mutant alleles from double TALEN injections showed complete deletions (Figure S1B,C,E in Additional file 1). These results show that defined large deletions that disrupt target gene expression can be generated easily via the combinatorial action of multiple TALENs., Next, to determine if large deletions in endogenous loci and element-specific deletions can be generated effectively, we designed and synthesized one TALEN pair towards sequences approximately 230 bp upstream of the predicted transcriptional start site (TSS), and a second pair targeting sequences within cyc exon 1 (cyc5TAL, chr12: 49,427,780-49,427,835; cyc3TAL, chr12: 49,428,165-49,428,221), spanning a genomic region of approximately 380 bp that encompasses the TSS (Figure 2a). Similarly, to target sqt, we generated one TALEN pair specific to the 5' sequences upstream of the TSS, and a second pair targeting sequences in the 3' UTR of sqt (sqt5TAL, chr21: 19,838,706-19,838,767; sqt3TAL, chr21: 19,840,869-19,840,929; zebrafish genome assembly Zv9). The TALEN target sites span a chromosomal region of approximately 2.16 kb, encompassing the sqt gene. We also used sqt5TAL in conjunction with a ZFN pair targeting sqt exon 1 (sqtZFN2, Figure 2a), to delete a 98 bp genomic region surrounding the TSS (sqtZFN2, chr21: 19,838,905-19,838,934).

(d) PCR with primers (yellow and black triangles in (a)) spanning the TALEN targeting sites (black arrows in (a)) shows the expected approximately 400 bp truncated cyc (white arrowhead), and 779 bp full-length cyc (black arrowhead) products in ten single embryos injected with cyc TALEN pairs, whereas the full-length product is observed in the un-injected control embryo. All embryos show faint intermediate sized products. No template control is indicated by -g. (e) PCR with primers (red and blue triangles in (a)) spanning the sqt locus show a 2.4 kb product (black arrowhead) for the intact sqt locus, whereas individual embryos with TALEN deletions show an approximately 220 bp complete locus deletion product (white arrowhead) and several other intermediate sized products. (f) PCR with primers spanning the sqt TSS site (red and green triangles in (a)) show a 478 bp full-length wild-type product (black arrowhead), and only one embryo (number 1) shows the expected approximately 300 bp deletion product (white arrowhead).

(h) Alignment of wild type sqt sequences with mutated PCR amplicons shows various deletions of approximately 2.2 kb between the targeting sites, accompanied by small insertions (red).
                    , To determine the optimal dosage, we microinjected various concentrations of sqt TALEN and ZFN pairs, or cyc TALEN pairs into one-cell zebrafish embryos individually and in combinations, and assessed the cutting efficiency, phenotypes and survival at 24 hpf (Table 3; Figures S1A-D,F-G,I-J and S2 in Additional file 1). Cyclopia and midline defects, phenotypes that are visible in cyc and sqt mutant embryos [23, 25], were found at frequencies ranging from 13 to 40% for cyc and 15 to 25% for sqt, indicating bi-allelic mutations in a proportion of injected F0 embryos (Figure 2b,c, Table 3; Figure S2 in Additional file 1). The efficacy of deletion mutations was assessed by PCR and sequencing from individual 1 dpf embryos (Figure 2d-f; Figure S1A-D,F-G,I-J in Additional file 1). Alignment to wild-type sqt genomic sequences showed that each TALEN and ZFN pair by itself generated small insertions and deletions of varying lengths (Figure S1D,I in Additional file 1), consistent with previous reports using single ZFN or TALEN pairs [9, 10, 26]. PCR performed on embryos injected with combinations of cyc5TAL and cyc3TAL, sqt5TAL and sqt3TAL, or sqt5TAL and sqtZFN2 showed both small and large fragments, including some of the size expected by targeted deletion of the intervening sequences (approximately 400 bp for cyc, approximately 220 bp for sqt whole locus deletion, approximately 300 bp for sqt TSS deletion), although the sqt5TAL+sqtZFN2 pair was not as efficient as the other double nuclease pair injections (Figure 2d-f; Figure S1B,C,F,G in Additional file 1). Sequencing of the PCR amplicons and alignment to wild-type cyc and sqt sequences shows that large deletions can be accompanied by insertions at both 5' and 3' targeting sites, indicative of non-homologous end joining events (Figure 2G,H; Figure S1B,C,F,G in Additional file 1). These results show that large defined deletions in endogenous loci can be generated efficiently by using multiple targeting nucleases, and result in mutant phenotypes. Furthermore, TALENs can be used simultaneously with ZFNs to generate chromosomal lesions (Figures S4 and S5 in Additional file 1).Table 3

                    Numbers were tabulated from at least two independent experiments.
                  , To determine the germ-line transmission frequency of the deletion mutations, we raised sqt and cyc nuclease-injected embryos to adulthood, and screened their progeny by PCR with primers spanning the targeting sites (colored triangles in Figure 2a; Table S2 in Additional file 1). For cyc, we observed deletions in 4.5 to 23% F1 progeny of 10/36 F0 founders. Of these, 9/10 founders yielded embryos with complete TSS deletions, 1/10 showed a smaller deletion near the cyc3TAL target site, and the same founder also transmitted a second mutation comprising a 187 bp deletion near the cyc5TAL target site, together with a 174 bp inversion and a 14 bp insertion near the 3' cyc3TAL target site (Table 4; Figure S3 in Additional file 1). In 3/10 founders, we also observed multiple mutation events (Figure S3 in Additional file 1). We identified sqt whole-locus deletions in 3.3 to 9.5% F1 progeny of 6/56 F0 founders injected with the sqt5TAL and sqt3TAL pairs. The smaller 5' TSS deletions generated with the sqt5TAL and sqtZFN2 pairs were observed in 3.3 to 6.7% F1 embryos from 2/28 F0 fish (Table 3; Figure S4A,B in Additional file 1). However, of the two founders with the sqt TSS deletion, only one appears to have been due to targeting by both sqt5TAL and sqtZFN2 pairs, whereas the other is likely from activity of the sqt5TAL alone (Figures S4 and S5 in Additional file 1). These results suggest that cyc is targeted at higher efficiency than sqt by the nucleases. For sqt, the efficiency and the germ-line transmission frequency of the larger sqt whole locus deletions are not substantially different from that of the smaller sqt TSS deletions.Table 4

                    , We then ascertained if the sqt TSS and whole locus deletions actually abolish sqt RNA expression in mutant embryos. We also determined if adjacent genomic regions and elements were affected by the sqt deletions, by examining expression of neighboring genes (eif4ebp1, htr1ab, and rnf180; Figure 3k) at appropriate stages. RT-PCR analyses to detect expression of immediate flanking loci show that their transcription is unaffected in the sqt
                sg27
                 TSS deletion mutant embryos (Figure 3l). By contrast, expression of sqt RNA is significantly reduced in embryos heterozygous for the sqt
                sg27
                 TSS deletion mutation, and is not detected in homozygous sqt
                sg27
                 embryos (Figure 3l). Similarly, sqt RNA expression is not detected in homozygous sqt
                sg32
                 whole-locus deletion mutant embryos, whereas flanking gene expression is unaffected (Figure 3m). Thus, our sqt deletions do not affect neighboring transcriptional units and these deletions are bona fide sqt RNA-null alleles., Our method demonstrates the ease of generating heritable whole locus deletions by the combinatorial action of multiple targeting nucleases. The ability to easily create targeted, heritable deletions in animal models such as zebrafish will greatly facilitate generation and analysis of humanized deletion mutations such as those observed in patients with hereditary neuropathies or polydactyly [27, 28]. Therefore, we believe our strategy can be applied in a variety of organisms, including those (for example, the mouse) in which current methods for chromosomal engineering employ the labor-, time- and resource-intensive strategy of first generating targeted insertions by homologous recombination, and then editing via Cre/Lox or Flp/FRT systems. Recently, Zu et al. [29] described a method using TALENs to make precise modifications by homologous recombination in zebrafish. This is an immensely valuable method for directed genome engineering, and could potentially also be used to generate precise segmental deletions by engineering loxP sites at desired locations on chromosomes [29, 30]. However, the germ-line transmission efficiency of targeted homologous recombination by this method is currently approximately 1.5%. In contrast, our method to generate deletions by direct targeting of chromosomal segments using multiple targeting nucleases is efficient, and does not require introduction of Cre recombinase or breeding for additional generations (Table 5). Therefore, combinations of targeted nucleases can be used to rapidly generate chromosomal deletions at predetermined locations.Table 5

                  , Chromosomal deletions can be used for analyzing gene clusters and regulatory regions, and for determining the functions of non-coding as well as coding RNAs in the genome. In support of this possibility, our sqt

                 and sqt
                sg32
                 deletion mutant embryos manifest phenotypes that are consistent with the previously identified sqt mutations. Thus, this strategy can be used effectively to investigate the roles of all 'functional' RNAs in the genome., The various targeting nucleases have different constraints pertaining to target sites. For instance, TALENs prefer a 5' T nucleotide, whereas CRISPR/Cas9 requires a GG dinucleotide for targeting. The spacer requirements for the various nucleases are also different, and targetable sites for the different nucleases likely occur at different frequencies in genomes [31, 32]. Therefore, using the combinatorial action of various nucleases can facilitate generation of defined deletions at desired locations with higher efficacy. Moreover, some TALEN and ZFN sites (for instance, our sqt ZFN target sites) are just not targeted efficiently for reasons that are still unclear. Hence, the ability to use multiple targeting nucleases in various combinations offers additional flexibility and alternative approaches to engineer chromosomes than is possible with individual nuclease pairs. The efficiency and precision of the deletion events can be improved further by using nuclease variants such as the 'GoldyTALEN' system [30]., Our simple, facile and efficient strategy is largely PCR-based, and, therefore, can be used with modest resources to generate deletion mutants for investigating functional elements in the genome. Finally, this approach of generating large, defined heritable deletions by simultaneously targeting two discrete regions on a single chromosome can potentially also be deployed with RNA-guide mediated or other emerging DNA cleavage methods [32–34] to enhance the toolkit for heritable chromosomal engineering in a variety of organisms., Targeted and heritable chromosomal deletions can be rapidly generated in a whole organism by using the combinatorial action of targeting nucleases. Multiple nuclease pairs are apparently more effective than single nuclease pairs in generating targeted deletions. Whole-locus as well as TSS element-specific deletions were generated efficiently by this method, and stably transmitted through the germ-line. The deletion mutations result in transcript-null alleles that manifest embryonic mutant phenotypes, demonstrating functional consequences of the chromosomal lesions. This simple, facile and efficient strategy can be used with modest resources. Thus, our strategy can be used to generate disease models, and for analysis of gene clusters, regulatory regions and functional RNAs in the genomes of a variety of organisms."

Crop species often have large, polyploid genomes with high levels of repetitive sequences, which pose challenges for generating genome assemblies. As Bevan and Uauy [2] describe in their Review article, the recent advances made in next-generation sequencing technologies, combined with the development of bioinformatics approaches, have allowed the assembly of many crop genomes. These improvements have enabled new opportunities for improving existing varieties of crops, in addition to developing new varieties., Bread wheat is a staple food crop across the world, and has a complex hexaploid genome. To apply effective genomics approaches to improve and breed new bread wheat varieties it will be essential to generate a complete genome sequence. Although whole genome shotgun sequencing allowed the recent assembly of the bread wheat gene set [3], a complete bread wheat genome will be necessary to determine the full effect of genomic variation on wheat phenotypes. Philippe et al. [4] describe the application of BAC-by-BAC sequencing to generate a physical map of wheat chromosome 1BL, which has the highest marker density to-date with 11 markers per Mb, and also has high levels of anchoring and contig ordering. It is hoped that applying the methods employed in Philippe et al. to the other wheat chromosomes may allow a complete bread wheat genome sequence to be produced in the near future., Changes in genome structure, in particular copy number variations, may play a role in regulating phenotypic variation in plants. However, the mechanisms regulating the production of copy number variation and the distribution of copy number variants throughout important crop genomes, have remained elusive. Muñoz-Amatriaín et al. [5] compare copy number variation distribution between the reference cultivar Morex and 14 barley genotypes (including eight cultivars and six wild barleys) using a barley comparative genomic hybridization array. Interestingly, they identify higher levels of diversity in copy number variation in wild barleys compared with cultivars, which may facilitate future barley breeding programs., Despite the sequencing of the maize genome in 2009 [6], comparatively little is known about the high levels of genetic diversity that exist between the many maize inbred lines. To address this, Romay et al. [7] perform genotyping-by-sequencing of 681,257 SNP markers in the 2,815 maize accessions in the USA national maize inbred seed bank. This resource will be invaluable for the analysis of genetic diversity within the publicly available maize panel using genome-wide association studies and genomic selection approaches., A key question in maize genomics has been to determine the mechanisms that control the conservation and divergence of transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in hybrids. To investigate this, He et al. [8] generate transcriptomic and epigenomic maps in the shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines, as well as in their reciprocal hybrids. They show that although there is a positive correlation between gene expression and histone modifications in hybrids and parents, intriguingly there is no significant parental bias in gene expression in maize hybrids, in either shoots or roots., Since Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, it necessarily has the longest history in plant genomics. Despite this, there are many aspects of Arabidopsis growth and development that remain unknown. Forward genetic screens are a powerful way of determining the functions of genes in plants, although applying traditional methods to genetically map mutations can be laborious. Identifying the causal mutation of a phenotype can be accelerated by combining genetic mapping with whole genome sequencing, in a process termed mapping-by-sequencing, and James et al. [9] describe important new guidelines for mapping-by-sequencing in Arabidopsis. They generate a Perl-based simulation tool called Pop-seq, which simulates mapping populations to determine the number of plants and the sequencing depth required to identify candidate mutations in outcrossed and backcrossed mapping populations., Understanding how cell type specification and differentiation are regulated is an important area of plant biology, and Arabidopsis root hair cells represent an excellent system for studying this. Lan et al. [10] generate a reference map of transcript abundance, cell-type dependent splicing, and differential accumulation of proteins in Arabidopsis root hair cells. By comparing transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, they show that while gene expression is associated with higher abundances of mRNA and protein, decreased gene expression does not necessarily correlate with reduced protein abundance., 
                Brachypodium distachyon is a model grass species, which is closely related to wheat and barley, and can be used to study grain development: a trait that is sensitive to heat stress. H2A.Z nucleosomes have been shown to regulate transcription in a temperature-dependent manner in Arabidopsis as their occupancy in transcriptional start sites of genes reduces with concomitant increases in temperature [11]. However, little is known about the mechanisms controlling temperature-dependent grain development in grasses. Boden et al. [12] show that increasing temperature has stronger effects on B. distachyon morphology, transcription and H2A.Z nucleosome distribution in reproductive grain development compared with vegetative seedling development. They also find that transgenic plants with reduced H2A.Z occupancy phenocopy heat-stressed wild-type plants, suggesting that H2A.Z nucleosomes mediate increased thermal sensitivity to heat stress during B. distachyon reproductive development., Due to their sessile nature, plants must respond to environmental signals, and the sensitivity of plants to their environment has fascinated scientists and poets alike. Shelley eloquently notes in his poem 'The Sensitive Plant' that Mimosa pudica leaves can open and close in response to the diurnal cycle as well as in response to touch. However, plants also elicit less conspicuous responses at the level of gene expression and metabolism., Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is an extensively cultivated fruit crop that exhibits phenotypic plasticity of its berries: this can mean that berries on a single plant mature at different rates, leading to variations in wine quality that are strongly dependent on the environment and vintage. To understand the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of grapevine berries to environmental differences, Dal Santo et al. [13] grew a single clone of Vitis vinifera cultivar Corvina in 11 different vineyards across Italy and harvested berries at three developmental stages (veraison, mid-ripening and fully-ripe) across three consecutive years. By performing microarrays and mass spectrometry analyses, they show that the different vineyard environments do not significantly affect gene expression. However, different season climates affect gene expression and metabolism, particularly with regard to genes regulating the synthesis of phenylpropanoid-derived compounds, and early stages of berry development are most responsive to seasonal climate changes. These results will help determine why different terroirs affect the quality of wine, and will aid breeding programs to improve berry and wine quality., In addition to abiotic stresses, plants must also respond to biotic interactions. As reviewed in Clare et al. [14], genome-wide approaches are beginning to be employed to determine the mechanisms controlling plant-pollinator interactions. Turner et al. [15] discuss how genomics techniques have also unraveled the striking complexity of plant microbiomes, and Rey and Schornack [16] highlight that determining how beneficial symbiotic microbes and detrimental parasitic microbes interact with plant hosts will be crucial for effective crop breeding programs. In addition, Pais et al. [17] discuss progress in understanding how plant parasitic oomycetes, a destructive group of pathogens that cause significant damage to crop yields, infect plant hosts. To investigate the molecular interactions that occur between Phytophthora capsici and tomato, Jupe et al. [18] compare transcriptional changes that occur simultaneously in the pathogen and plant over the course of infection. They identify two significant transcriptional changes associated with early infection and the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy, which may play significant roles in controlling infection in plants and also the life cycle of the pathogen., Trees are an extremely diverse group of plants that have evolved important roles in many ecosystems, and forest trees are also of great economic importance. Neale et al. [19] provide an update on how research on tree genomics has been progressing, and argue that open access data sharing will be essential for allowing the development of forest tree genomics, as well as outlining key research priorities that the community need to focus on., The cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, produces vibrantly colored pods containing beans that are used to create chocolate. There are several varieties of cacao, and the Matina cultivar is a traditional variety with low genetic diversity. Some cacao varieties have undesirable traits such as an unpleasant aroma and flavor caused by high acidity and astringency, which are associated with red pod coloration. Cacao derived from varieties with poor flavor qualities is often blended with cacao derived from other varieties that have more desirable flavors associated with green pod coloration. Unfortunately, the blending of cacao reduces the overall quality of chocolate. Motamayor et al. [20] generate a high quality genome sequence of Theobroma cacao cultivar Matina to improve the speed and accuracy of cacao breeding. Utilizing the genome sequence in conjunction with a haplotype-based method, they identify the TcMYB113 gene, which encodes an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, as a likely candidate for controlling red/green pod coloration: higher expression of TcMYB113 is associated with red pod color. It is hoped that these results will rapidly accelerate breeding programs to improve the quality of chocolate produced from cacao beans., Co-ordinating a special issue is an exciting enterprise, and we are indebted to all our authors for submitting their interesting research, and to our reviewers for taking the time to scrutinize the studies. We would also like to thank our Guest Editors, Mario Caccamo and Erich Grotewold, for their invaluable ideas, advice and support, and for contributing their Editorial discussing why plant genomics is such a timely topic [21]. We are passionate about plants at Genome Biology, and we hope that you will share our enthusiasm for this special issue on the blossoming field of plant genomics."

The oomycetes are a diverse and ancient group of eukaryotic microbes that are classified within the stramenopiles, many of which parasitize plants, and are therefore very important to humans [1]. Plant pathogenic oomycetes target a wide range of plants, resulting in significant damage to agricultural and natural ecosystems. The pathogenic lifestyle of oomycetes can be biotrophic, requiring living plants to survive; necrotrophic, actively killing plant cells and feeding on dead matter; or hemibiotrophic, with an initial biotrophic phase followed by a necrotrophic phase. The most notorious oomycetes belong to the genus Phytophthora ('plant destroyer' in Greek), which, with over 100 species, are arguably the most devastating pathogens of dicotyledonous plants [2]. Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato and tomato late blight, has been a recurrent threat to world agriculture ever since triggering the Irish potato famine in the 1840s [3]. P. infestans is remarkable for its ability to rapidly adapt to resistant plants, and also belongs to a lineage that has experienced repeated host-jumps throughout its evolution [3, 4]., The pathogenic and evolutionary success of P. infestans and other plant parasitic oomycetes can be ascribed to their diverse and rapidly evolving effector gene complements [5]. During infection, certain plant genotypes specifically recognize pathogens and mount active defenses to attenuate pathogen progression. Firstly, plant basal defense responses are activated by the perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors at the plant cell surface, resulting in PAMP-triggered immunity [6]. However, pathogen effector proteins can act as virulence factors to suppress these basal defense mechanisms. A second wave of plant host defense acts largely within the cell through the genetically determined recognition of a subset of pathogen effectors, known as avirulence (AVR) proteins. On certain plant genotypes, these AVR effectors can become a liability for the pathogen because they can be detected by immune receptors, encoded by resistance (R) genes, which initiate effective defense reactions. Recognition of AVR effectors can lead to the activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) that often results in a rapid localized host cell death, termed the hypersensitive response, thereby limiting disease progression [6]. However, pathogens can also secrete effectors to suppress ETI and promote disease progression. As a result, effector genes are under dynamic, even opposite, selection pressures, depending on the host plant genotype that the pathogen interacts with., Despite their importance in agricultural systems and the environment, the oomycetes have been relatively poorly studied. Recent work on oomycete effectors has greatly benefited from high-throughput in planta expression assays to link effector genes to biological activities, and from the ability to mine effectors from genome sequences based on conserved host translocation motifs and their presence in well-defined genome compartments. Such approaches could only be implemented because of the availability of genome sequences. As a consequence, recent research on oomycete effector trafficking, function and evolution resulted in major conceptual advances for plant pathology [5, 7, 8]., Here, we review how sequencing plant parasitic oomycete genomes and using genomics approaches to study host plant responses to infection has advanced our understanding of oomycete-plant interactions, and ultimately of plant processes that are perturbed by these pathogens. Oomycete pathosystems are an excellent case study illustrating how plant pathogen genomes can be a remarkable resource for basic and applied plant biology (Figure 1).

(b) This allows the computational prediction of candidate effector genes using the knowledge gained from characterized effector proteins. In the case of Phytophthora pathogens, prediction is facilitated by the presence of effector genes in gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions of the genomes, and by the modular structure of effectors. (c) Cloning of these effector genes and (d) expression of candidate effectors in planta using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression systems such as agroinfiltration (left) and wound inoculation (right). (e) These help us understand diverse plant processes. For instance, (i) identification of host proteins that interact with pathogen effectors can give insights into the plant pathways targeted and perturbed during the infection process. (ii) In addition, effectors can be used as molecular probes to study the structural changes that occur during plant infection at a subcellular level. For instance, effectors can be fused to fluorescent proteins to assess their localization in planta. (iii) The suppression of plant immune responses such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can also be studied. Blue line shows induction of ROS by flagellin peptide in the absence of effector proteins. This ROS burst is reduced (red) by the expression of an oomycete effector. (iv) The activation of host immunity by effector proteins helps the dissection of plant susceptibility and resistance mechanisms. For example, the hypersensitive response (brown spots on leaves) against effectors transiently expressed in planta can be used to identify immune receptors (R genes) of high value for plant breeding.
                    , Currently, draft genome sequences are available for ten oomycete species, nine of which are plant pathogens [3, 9–16] (Figure 2). One striking feature of these oomycete genomes is the considerable variability in size, ranging from 37 Mb for the biotrophic plant pathogen Albugo laibachii (an obligate parasite of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana), to 240 Mb for the hemibiotrophic P. infestans (which parasitizes tomato and potato). These observed differences in genome size are largely due to the proliferation of transposable elements and repetitive DNA, which in P. infestans account for 74% of the genome content [3]. At 100 Mb, the downy mildew Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, an obligate parasite of A. thaliana, also has a relatively large genome size, a recurrent trend in biotrophic oomycete and fungal pathogens [12, 15, 17]. Repeat regions in these expanded genomes tend to be unstable; they may promote genome duplication and shuffling, increased rates of mutagenesis and gene silencing [17, 18].

The representative phylogeny depicts oomycete pathogens with sequenced genomes and was generated using Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) with National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy identifiers (branch lengths are arbitrary). Pathogen lifestyles and major variations in effector gene families are indicated along the tree branches. Potential loss of particular effector classes in a lineage is indicated by a red cross.

                    , The genomes of Phytophthora species have a peculiar bipartite architecture. They show a characteristic structure comprising blocks of conserved gene order, containing approximately 90% of core ortholog genes, separated by regions in which gene order is not conserved [3, 11]. Within conserved blocks, gene density is high and repeat and transposable element content is low (Figure 3a). The trend is most extreme in the genome of P. infestans in which the gene-dense and gene-sparse regions can be easily distinguished at the whole-genome level using flanking intergenic region length data (Figure 3b). Remarkably, effector genes mostly populate the gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions of Phytophthora genomes [3, 11] (Figure 3). Because these regions evolve more rapidly than the gene-dense compartments of the genome, P. infestans has been described as having a 'two-speed' genome [19]. The presence of effector genes in plastic genomic regions is thought to promote rapid adaptation to new hosts and evasion of recognition by host immune receptors. It is reminiscent of the occurrence of plant immune receptors (R genes) in rapidly evolving gene clusters of plant genomes [20, 21].

(b) Distribution of Phytophthora infestans RXLR effectors, CRN effectors, and ribosomal protein genes (spots) according to the length of their 5' and 3' flanking intergenic regions. Percentages show the proportion of the gene group falling in the gene-dense region (GDR) and gene-sparse region quadrants as delimited by the 1.5 kb flanking intergenic region length cutoff (dashed lines).
                    , Not all plant pathogenic oomycetes have highly expanded, repeat-rich genomes. Phytophthora ultimum has the lowest level of repetitive DNA at 7%; this may be attributed to the presence of DNA methylases, which have been shown to inhibit repeat expansion and are absent in the P. infestans genome [13]. The relatively compact genome sizes of Albugo
                candida and A. laibachii (45 and 37 Mb, respectively) may reflect the loss of biosynthetic pathways in these obligate parasites [14, 15]. However, to fully understand genome evolution in parasitic oomycetes, we still need to compare the genomes of the parasites to their saprophytic kin. Fortunately, genome sequencing projects of several non-parasitic oomycete species are in progress., Effector proteins belong to two classes that target distinct sites in the host plant: apoplastic effectors are secreted into the plant extracellular space, whereas cytoplasmic effectors are translocated inside the plant cell, where they target different subcellular compartments [22]. Both classes of effectors are modular proteins with cleavable amino-terminal secretion signals. Cytoplasmic effectors carry an additional domain after the signal peptide that mediates translocation inside host cells and is defined by conserved motifs, such as the RXLR amino acid sequence [22]., Several functional classes of apoplastic effectors have been described, including enzyme inhibitors and the NEP1-like toxin proteins (NLPs) [22, 23]. One important function of apoplastic effectors is to disable extracellular plant defenses and enable the pathogen to adapt to the protease-rich environment of the plant apoplast [24, 25]. Protease inhibitor effectors that target both plant serine and cysteine proteases have been reported in several oomycetes [3, 11–13]. The P. infestans cystatin-like EPIC1 and EPIC2B inhibit the cysteine proteases PIP1, RCR3 and C14 from tomato and potato host plants [24–26]. Interestingly, C14 is also targeted by the cytoplasmic effector AVRblb2, which interferes with its secretion into the apoplast [27]. Overall, pathogen effectors have proved to be useful probes to identify plant proteases that have roles in immunity. For example, the tomato protease RCR3 is targeted by effectors from a fungus, an oomycete and a nematode, suggesting that it may have an important role in plant apoplastic defenses [24, 28]., There are three validated classes (RXLR, Crinkler (CRN) and CHXC) and one putative class (YxSL[RK]) of cytoplasmic effectors in oomycetes. The best-studied are the RXLR proteins, which include effectors with an avirulence activity, which are detected by plant immune receptors [29]. The carboxy-terminal regions of RXLR proteins carry the biochemical effector activity and about half of these proteins have a similar overall conformation, termed the WY-fold [30–33]. This fold may be an adaptive structural unit that can support effector diversification to gain new functions and/or evade plant host immunity [30, 34]. Among RXLR-WY effectors, AVR3a associates with the potato E3 ubiquitin ligase CMPG1 to suppress the cell death induced by another P. infestans secreted protein, INF1 elicitin [35]. Most RXLR effectors are not predicted to have an enzymatic activity. One exception is Avr3b from Phytophthora sojae, an NADPH and ADP-ribose pyrophosphorylase with a Nudix hydrolase motif that suppresses plant immunity [36]. Although the mechanism by which Avr3b interferes with immunity remains to be determined, Avr3b may have evolved to mimic plant Nudix hydrolases, which are known to act as negative regulators of plant immunity [36]., Gene expression profiles in oomycetes exhibit dynamic changes throughout the different developmental stages of their life cycle [37, 38], and dramatic changes occur during infection of host plants [3, 37, 39]. Therefore, high-throughput gene expression analysis by sequencing of cDNA libraries, microarray and RNA-seq technologies are valuable tools to identify candidate virulence factors and to investigate the role of different gene families in the interaction between oomycetes and their hosts [4, 39–42]. Little is known about the molecular clues that trigger these substantial shifts in gene expression and how they are regulated, but recent studies combining genome-wide analysis of promoter sequences with transcriptomics data have enabled the systematic prediction of cis-regulatory motifs that might have a role in stage-specific gene expression [43, 44]., Monitoring gene expression during potato infection showed that about 2.7% of P. infestans genes are induced at least two-fold during infection compared with vegetative growth [3]. In addition, patterns of gene induction correlate with the progression from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth in the host plant (Figure 4a). In total, 79 of the 563 RXLR effector genes predicted in P. infestans display a peak of expression during the biotrophic phase (2 to 3 days post-inoculation, dpi), decaying to basal levels at the necrotrophic phase of infection (4 to 5 dpi) [3]. Comparable induction profiles during biotrophy have been described for P. sojae RXLR effector genes [45]. These expression patterns support the hypothesis that RXLR effectors function mainly during the biotrophic phase of infection. Likewise, several apoplastic effector genes encoding protease inhibitors and cysteine-rich secreted proteins show expression profiles similar to those of RXLR genes in P. infestans [3, 46] (Figure 4a). Finally, a recent analysis of the Phytophthora capsici CRN gene family revealed two classes of CRN effectors with distinct expression patterns during tomato infection [47] (Figure 4b).
                    Figure 4
                      
                        Expression patterns of oomycete effector genes. (a) Expression profiles of two representative Phytophthora infestans effector genes in different developmental (mycelia, sporangia and zoospores) and infection (biotrophic and necrotrophic) phases. The life cycle of P. infestans begins with sporangia that are released and travel by wind to new host plants. Under suitable environmental conditions zoospores are released from the sporangium, germinate and penetrate the host plant to initiate infection. As a hemibiotroph, P. infestans undergoes a two-stage infection process, with an initial biotrophic phase followed by a later necrotrophic phase. The data correspond to P. infestans reference strain T30-4 and are based on [3], with expression during infection phases measured in potato. Gene induction values were normalized against the mycelia sample. epi1 encodes an apoplastic effector that functions as protease inhibitor [73] and Avr3a encodes a cytoplasmic RXLR effector [74]. Ubiquitin and pisp3 [75] are included as controls. dpi, days post-inoculation. (b) Crinkler (CRN) gene expression profiles during infection (reproduced from [47]). The heat map shows the expression pattern of full-length Phytophthora capsici CRN genes following tomato infection. Green is downregulated and red is upregulated compared with the median of each sample. Samples were collected at 0, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection. Gene classes with distinct expression profiles are indicated on the right.
                    , Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy, but the P. infestans gene PiNPP1.1, encoding a necrosis-inducing protein, is upregulated during the transition from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth of P. infestans in tomato [48]. SNE1, a gene encoding a suppressor of the host cell death induced by PiNPP1.1, is down-regulated at the same time points of infection [49, 50]. In a similar way, the expression of the P. sojae PsojNIP gene, which encodes a necrosis-inducing protein, is highly induced at late infection stages [51, 52] and it has been suggested that these necrosis-inducing toxins may favor colonization of host plants during the necrotrophic growth [23, 53]., Gain and loss of effector gene induction can also influence the outcome of the interaction with the host plant. Cooke et al. [54] performed infection time course experiments by hybridizing NimbleGen microarrays with cDNA samples from potato leaves inoculated with three different P. infestans strains. This allowed the identification of distinct isolate-specific sets of RXLR genes induced during potato infection. Transcriptional silencing of effector genes is one of the mechanisms that plant pathogenic oomycetes deploy to avoid the activation of host R-gene-mediated immunity. A few examples have been described for races of P. infestans and P. sojae in which the expression of specific RXLR effectors is correlated with their virulence or avirulence on specific host genotypes [29, 55–59]. In P. sojae, these transcriptional polymorphisms have been attributed to insertions or deletions in the promoter region [55, 57, 59]., Plants respond to pathogen effectors in various ways depending on the genotypes of both the plant and the invading pathogen. In the first instance when the effector is recognized by pattern recognition receptors, plants can initiate processes associated with PAMP-triggered immunity, such as oxidative bursts, callose deposition and expression of pathogenesis-related genes. Effector proteins can, conversely, act to suppress these processes, promoting pathogen progression and manipulating plant physiological processes. In resistant plant genotypes, products of plant immune receptors, encoded by R genes, may recognize some of these effector proteins and mount ETI-associated processes to restrict pathogen colonization. A major challenge for the plant-pathogen research community is to link effector sequences to plant phenotypes and processes. Functional high-throughput screens of oomycete effector candidates can be performed by in planta transient expression [45, 60, 61] or by delivery of candidate effector proteins by the bacterial type III secretion system [62, 63]. These strategies can give valuable insights into the virulence activities of effector proteins, particularly regarding the suppression of host plant immunity [45, 60, 63]. However, some of these studies need to be analyzed with caution, as discussed by Bozkurt et al. [5]. One example is the screening for suppression of immunity using the mammalian cell-death-inducing protein BAX with a heterologous expression system, which gave high frequencies of cell death suppression when testing P. sojae RXLR effectors [45]. This is because the BAX-induced cell death can be readily suppressed following activation of the unfolded protein response [5]. Another example is the screening of H. arabidopsidis RXLR effectors for the suppression of callose deposition, a component of PAMP-triggered immunity. Given that the frequency of effectors suppressing callose deposition found in this study was high (35 out of 62) [63], follow-up experiments are essential to determine whether this does truly represent identical and redundant defense suppression activities for most of the H. arabidopsidis effectors tested., Heterologous transient expression of fluorescently tagged effectors in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana is a useful tool for subcellular localization screens. Caillaud et al. [64] used this approach to test the localization of 49 RXLR effectors of H. arabidopsidis, showing that 33% of the tested proteins localize to the nucleus, another 33% accumulate in the nucleus and cytoplasm and the remaining effectors mainly target various plant cell membranes. In a similar way, Stam et al. [47] analyzed the subcellular localization of 11 diverse P. capsici CRN carboxy-terminal domains and found that all the tested domains target the host nucleus. These findings suggest that the plant cell nucleus has a crucial role in virulence and immunity, and highlights how effectors can help to elucidate the plant cell processes that take place during the interaction with oomycete pathogens., High-throughput approaches can also be used to study the avirulence activity of effectors and can help to identify and assign functions to new immune receptors [60–62]. Vleeshouwers et al. [61] used a library of RXLR effector genes predicted computationally from the P. infestans genome to screen wild Solanum species (related to potato and tomato) for induction of hypersensitive responses indicating the presence of a plant R gene. A set of 54 effectors were expressed in planta using a Potato virus × (PVX) agroinfection assay optimized for Solanum. This led to the identification of AVRblb1, the effector protein recognized by the Solanum bulbocastanum (wild potato species) resistance protein Rpi-blb1. In a similar study, the S. bulbocastanum resistance gene Rpi-blb2 was co-expressed with a PVX-based library of 62 P. infestans RXLR effector clones in N. benthamiana. This approach allowed the identification of the corresponding effector Avrblb2 [60]. Both Rpi-blb1 and Rpi-blb2 are considered broad-spectrum resistance genes, and the availability of the corresponding Avr genes could assist the use of these R genes in agriculture [29]., In addition, the use of effectors in large-scale screens of germplasm has facilitated the discovery of new resistance genes and their classification into discrete recognition specificities, accelerating the cloning of R genes while avoiding redundant cloning efforts [61, 62, 65]. Effectors can be used to identify R gene homologs in plant species that are more compatible for breeding. These strategies are nicely illustrated by the work of Vleeshouwers et al. [61], in which the screen of several wild Solanum species with a set of predicted P. infestans RXLR effectors led to the discovery and rapid cloning of Solanum stoloniferum
                Rpi-sto1 and Solanum papita
                Rpi-pta1, both functionally equivalent to S. bulbocastanum
                Rpi-blb1, with the additional advantage that S. stoloniferum and S. papita are sexually more compatible with potato, which would facilitate the introgression of this resistance specificity into commercial potato cultivars., Recently, high-throughput effector screens have also proved useful for dissecting the complex genetic basis of the late blight resistance in the potato cultivar Sarpo Mira, which has both qualitative and quantitative ('field' resistance) components [66]. This analysis identified Rpi-Smira2, an R protein conferring partial resistance on recognition of the P. infestans RXLR effector AVRSmira2. AvrSmira2 is diagnostic of field resistance to late blight and can be used to accelerate the breeding and cloning of Rpi-Smira2, showing that effectors can be used to map linkage of quantitative traits, facilitating quantitative resistance breeding., Another approach in which knowledge of effectors can assist the deployment of disease resistance against oomycetes is through the monitoring of effector allele diversity in pathogen populations [29, 67, 68]. This can provide valuable information to assess the potential of a given R gene regarding its spectrum and durability, and to design control strategies based on the dynamic distribution of virulence alleles in a given population, allowing the early detection of races that can overcome the deployed R genes. For example, the P. infestans avirulence gene Avrblb1 belongs to the highly ipiO RXLR effector family. The set of ipiO variants present in a given isolate determines the outcome of the interaction between this isolate and host plants carrying the Rpi-blb1 gene, with some combinations conferring avirulence and others overcoming this resistance gene [69, 70]. Therefore, monitoring ipiO diversity in P. infestans populations can tell us whether races are evolving in the field to overcome Rpi-blb1. In addition, genome and transcriptome analysis can be used to determine the set of effector genes present and expressed during infection by isolates of a given genotype, providing information on the R genes that can be deployed to control that particular genotype. This was illustrated by Cooke et al. [54], who showed that an isolate of the P. infestans 13_A2 genotype carries intact coding sequences of Avrblb1, Avrblb2 and Avrvnt1, and that these avirulence genes are induced during infection, suggesting that the cognate R genes (Rpi-blb1, Rpi-blb2 and Rpi-vnt1) could be used to control this aggressive genotype that is predominant in UK fields., Finally, it is also possible to expand the effector recognition specificity of a given R gene to new virulent alleles by performing artificial evolution by random mutagenesis [29], an approach that has been previously successful when applied to the PVX resistance gene Rx [71]., Pathogenomics has had a substantial impact on both basic and applied plant biology. Effectors have turned out to be effective molecular probes for a variety of plant processes, and knowledge gained from studying effectors has already had an impact on our understanding of basic plant processes, such as immune processes and cellular dynamics [5, 7]. So far, research has focused on a handful of species (Figure 2). In the future, the investigation of effectors from a diverse range of oomycetes, particularly species that alter plant development (such as those causing the deformity called 'witches' brooms') or rely on vertical transmission via plant seeds, is likely to reveal effectors that act beyond plant immunity [72]. Oomycete pathogenomics has also had a great impact on approaches to plant disease resistance breeding, an activity that has been traditionally somewhat 'blind' to the pathogen [29]. Effectors have turned out to be useful tools for probing plant germplasm for new resistance traits and are poised to improve the breeding and deployment of disease resistance genes in agriculture."

The rise and continuous improvement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has allowed researchers to shift focus from (usually small) model plant genomes to larger and more complex genomes of crop plants. Currently, about 34 flowering plant species have been sequenced and are publicly available, and new genomes, including recently the first genome of a gymnosperm, are being published every month. At the same time, novel technological challenges have emerged, particularly in computational data analysis, data distribution and storage. The premiere of the Plant Genomics Congress in the well-connected London-Heathrow Marriott Hotel brought together scientists and technology providers from different disciplines, while it maintained a personal atmosphere with about 240 participants. The conference focused on NGS technologies, plant genomic case studies, bioinformatics and functional genomics. Here, we highlight some of the exciting work presented at this conference., The breathtaking pace of development in sequencing technology opens new horizons, but simultaneously leads to new challenges. These issues were reflected by many talks and were addressed specifically in panel discussions. While there seemed to be a consensus among the panelists and audience that DNA sequences are never too long or too cheap, panelist Michel Morgante (University of Udine, Italy) stated that science is currently way behind technology, a fact clearly illustrated by the missing heritability problem and many other bottlenecks that are currently faced. Some other obstacles and potential solutions were discussed in various sessions concerning the challenges caused by the flood of sequencing data. While many of those issues can be addressed using sophisticated informatics infrastructure and process workflows, as demonstrated in talks from bioinformatics unit leaders of multiple institutions, it is still a matter of debate which data should be stored long-term and what the best technology for storage is. Most importantly, questions about funding of costs for data archiving and distribution are not yet fully resolved in many institutions, countries and funding schemes., Another important challenge of sequencing-enabled science is the development and application of appropriate analyses methods. As the sequencing of mRNA-derived cDNA libraries (RNA-seq) becomes more popular for transcriptome analyses, comprehensive in-depth evaluation of the power of RNA-seq will become very important. Etienne Delannoy (URGV, INRA, France) presented his work on comparing a state-of-the-art two-color microarray with RNA-seq data. Most interestingly, while the correlation between the reads of different sequencing runs was better between RNA-seq replicates than between microarrays, the power of detecting differentially expressed genes was lower than that of the microarrays, due to limitations of the currently used test statistics., Other ongoing challenges in RNA-seq include NGS library preparation protocols. Tamas Dalmay (University of East Anglia, UK) showed how preference of RNA ligase for certain hairpin structures can generate an adapter-dependent bias in the generation of small RNA-seq libraries. Notably, a signature of this bias is present in many previously published microRNA datasets. Fortunately, simple modifications in adapter sequences can overcome this problem, and thereby allow a more sensitive and quantitative detection of small RNAs., The gigantic, hexaploid 17 Gb genome of wheat is still a daunting challenge for sequencing technologies, but Michael Bevan (John Innes Centre, UK) described how a first step towards elucidating the wheat gene content has been made by combining 454 shotgun sequencing, sequencing of purified chromosome arms and high-resolution synteny maps, as published last year. Odd-Arne Olsen (UMB, Norway) reported further progress made by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing consortium based on the sequencing of dissected chromosome arms. A survey sequence of chromosome 7B that includes a gene catalog, virtual order of genes and markers will be released this year, while a BAC anchored and ordered sequence is the goal in the longer term., A new BAC-based strategy that was introduced by Hélène Berges (INRA - CNRGV, France) promises to alleviate the issues with complex plant genomes. With such a non-gridded BAC approach combined with 454 sequencing, map-based and positional cloning of loci in wheat that confer resistance against pathogens could be realized in relatively short time spans., The power of genome synteny in unraveling large crop genomes was pointed out by Klaus Mayer (MIPS, Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany). Chromosome survey sequence assemblies can be integrated using a 'GenomeZipper' approach that makes use of synteny to other sequenced grass genomes. The resulting gene maps can then be assigned to the different wheat sub-genomes that make up the hexaploid wheat genome. Subsequent meta-analysis and comparative analysis will shed light on the impact of polyploidization/hybridization events on gene content in bread wheat., Yielding colorful and tasty fruits, tomato and grape are tasty and colorful species that have long been subject to intensive breeding processes that have given rise to a large variety of fruit properties. Fruit quality traits in these species are of great economic importance. Mathilde Causse (INRA Avignon, France) reported association studies using 180 cherry tomato lines for 70 metabolites, revealing multiple significant associations underlying different metabolome states. To aid the mapping of causal genetic loci for fruit traits, other new genetic resources are being set up, such as a MAGIC tomato line population from eight divergent, fully sequenced parental strains for which phenotypes, metabolomes, proteomes and transcriptomes have been recorded in great detail., Another approach to reveal the secrets of tomato taste was introduced by Richard Visser (Wageningen UR Plant Breeding, Wageningen University & Research Centre, Netherlands): the 150 Tomato Genome Project will include the sequencing of old varieties, land races and wild accessions. Touching on a common theme at the conference, the speaker also emphasized that modern crop breeding programs require the integration of different types of -omics data, thus creating new challenges for data storage and analysis pipelines. Methods and software packages are now becoming available (and also for tetraploid species, which have more complex genetics)., Specific metabolites are of great interest in grape. In particular, polyphenols are among the strongest determinants of wine quality and have been associated with health benefits. Michel Morgante approached intra-species variation of grapevine using the PAN genome concept to differentiate the core genome, which is contained in all grape varieties, from the private, variety-specific genomes. With that concept in view, Alberto Ferrarini from the Massimo Delledonne lab (University of Verona, Italy) identified genes that underlie high polyphenol content using Tannat, the red wine variety with the highest polyphenol content. Interestingly, 'private' (variety-specific) genes contribute much more strongly to polyphenol pathway expression than core genes. This is a strong argument for a switch to a more PAN genome-centered approach for genetic mapping, since many current 'reference genome'-centered approaches are limited to the core genome., The research presented at the Plant Genomics Conference in London provided an informative snapshot of major current research directions in the field that encompass efforts to decipher the genomes of complex crop genomes, together with functional genomics approaches to understand the fundamental activities of plant genomes and their applications in plant breeding. In light of the rapid ongoing developments in sequencing technologies, it becomes ever more important to ensure that biology-driven research questions, experimental design, analytical rigor and careful data interpretation keep pace with data production. Conferences such as this provide important platforms to enable discussions and collaborations among experts from different areas in genomics, to raise the awareness of common aims and challenges, and eventually to move the field forward."

Not having the opportunity to travel to obtain food or run away from adverse conditions, plants have evolved to deal with extreme changes in the environment. Annual plants, for instance, can focus the most resource-intensive activities, such as reproduction, at the most favorable time of the year. Other changes, such as day-to-night fluctuations, are linked to the plant circadian cycle and the synchronized expression of specific sets of genes at particular times. Plants also need to cope with more sudden changes such as attacks from pathogens and grazing animals. These strategies are supported by rich and complex metabolic networks that enable plants to synthesize a wide range of compounds (for example, alkaloids, terpenoids and phenolics) [3]. The constant need for adaptation, the prevalence of polyploid species and past whole-genome duplication events are reflected in the larger number of genes observed in plants [4] compared with animals. This diversity has stimulated many of the scientific breakthroughs that have emerged from research in plant sciences, including the discovery of transposable elements in maize by Barbara McClintock back in the 1940s, the characterization of RNA interference [5] and, more recently, the use of TALE nucleases to target and edit plant genomes [6]. The completion of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome [7] at the turn of the century followed by the rice genome publications [8, 9] have also stirred a growing body of research in plant genomics. The success of Arabidopsis as a model organism is rooted in its accessible genetics tied to a relatively simple genome [10–12]. Many plants, especially some of the popular monocot crops and gymnosperm trees, have, however, more complex and larger genomes. The Triticeae tribe within the grasses family includes some of the most important cereal crops, such as barley (Hordeum vulgare), with a genome that is 50 times larger than Arabidopsis and almost twice the typical mammalian genome [13]. In the same family, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) adds another level of complexity with an allohexaploid genome that, over successive rounds of hybridization, has combined three diploid species with genomes the size of barley into a single huge genome. Another interesting example is the evolution and domestication of the dicot Brassicaceae family that includes Arabidopsis thaliana and gave rise to a number of economically important vegetable and oil crops such as broccoli, cabbage and oilseed rape. In a relatively short evolutionary time, this family expanded into species with markedly different external structural and anatomy, offering a unique model for the study of the underlying genetics of morphogenesis [14]. The complexity of these plant genomes has, however, posed an important challenge to the use of sequencing technologies and the downstream computational analyses [15]. Over the past few years, dramatic advances in cytogenetic techniques, sequencing technologies and more sophisticated sequence analysis methods have impacted research in some of the most complex and challenging crops [16–21]., One of the immediate challenges of plant genomics is to mine more efficiently the vast amount of data that are being generated on a daily basis as more and more plant genomes are being sequenced [22]. There is, however, an opportunity emerging from the integration of the latest technologies with more traditional genetics and the fact that plant genomes are highly plastic. The easy manipulation of plant genomes is not only a convenient tool for research, but it is also the foundation for modern plant breeding. The possibility of generating doubled haploids to obtain fully homozygous individuals, for instance, can significantly speed-up breeding, providing an opportunity to go faster 'from the genome to the field'. Genome-wide association studies are an example of the application of genomics in both model plant species and crops that have help to identify loci and alleles associated with complex traits [23–26]. The development of high-density molecular markers will be one of the most important tools for informing the design of the breeding programs of the future [27]. However, the most agronomically important traits, such as yield and drought tolerance, involve multiple genes and complex interactions with the environment, requiring more sophisticated breeding strategies such as genomic selection. The application of advanced genomics to improve breeding techniques in grass crops, for instance, will play a key role in securing affordable and nutritious food for an increasing human population., The reviews, opinions and scientific work presented in this special issue of Genome Biology are a testament to the coming of age of plant genomics research and its applications."
"98","A conifer genome spruces up plant phylogenomics","Pamela S Soltis, Douglas E Soltis","Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, Genetics Institute, University of Florida, Department of Biology, University of Florida","Pamela S Soltis","psoltis@flmnh.ufl.edu","27 June 2013","","","The Norway spruce genome provides key insights into the evolution of plant genomes, leading to testable new hypotheses about conifer, gymnosperm, and vascular plant evolution., Like the genomes of other conifers, the Norway spruce genome is immense [5], despite a typical conifer chromosome number of 2N = 24: the genome size for species of Picea ranges from 15.75 to 19.125 pg, and the draft genome for P. abies is 20 Gb (or about 20.5 pg). Based on analyses using synonymous substitution rates for inferring ancient WGDs, P. abies lacks evidence of WGDs other than the one that predated all extant seed plants [1]. The large genome of Picea and other conifers has occurred through mechanisms other than WGD: proliferation of long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), including both the well known Ty3-gypsy and Ty1-copia superfamilies of transposable elements, accounts for its genomic 'obesity' [5] and, by extension, that of other conifers [7]., Furthermore, the two fundamental differences between angiosperms and other seed plants relate to reproduction and water-conducting ability, and the genes found in the Picea genome provide information on these systems. P. abies, as expected, lacks FLOWERING LOCUS T, a set of key activation genes for flowering in angiosperms, and contains an expanded set of FT/TFL1-like genes, which probably act as repressors of flowering [5]. In contrast, the genetic control of water conduction is not as clear. Water transport in conifers is accomplished by cells called tracheids, but most angiosperms have more efficient conducting cells (vessels). Angiosperm-specific innovations in water conduction are controlled by a gene family (VASCULAR NAC DOMAIN, VND) that may have originated in gymnosperms, or possibly earlier - two VND genes were detected in P. abies, compared with seven in Arabidopsis., The sequencing of the Norway spruce genome [5] is a landmark development in our understanding of plant genomes. The gene space of conifers is not substantially different from that of angiosperms - despite the much larger conifer genomes. In fact, the number of predicted genes for essentially all sequenced plant genomes is approximately 25,000 regardless of genome size and the number of WGDs. Even the bladderwort Utricularia gibba (an angiosperm), with a genome size of only 77 Mb, has an estimated 28,500 genes [8], nearly the same as that predicted for P. abies (28,345). In contrast, the sacred lotus Nelumbo nucifera (also an angiosperm), with a genome size more than 10-fold greater than that of U. gibba and 20 times smaller than that of P. abies at 929 Mb, contains approximately 26,685 genes [9]. The consistency of these three estimates is striking, especially as the three papers [5, 8, 9] appeared within a month of one another and followed community standards for gene annotation. Furthermore, despite the much larger and more complex genomes of plants compared to those of most animals, the number of genes in their genomes is similar and does not seem to be proportional to genome size. Finally, the Norway spruce genome has expanded by the slow and steady accumulation of LTR-RTs, a phenomenon also observed in pine genomes [7]; this may reflect the lack of an efficient mechanism for eliminating these transposable elements., Because the P. abies genome is the sole representative of the four extant lineages of gymnosperms (conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes; Figure 1), it is difficult to infer which features are common to other conifers and which are unique to P. abies. However, taken together with data for other land plants, including genomic resources available for other gymnosperms, we will be able to start to assemble an understanding of the features that are unique to seed plants as a whole and those that are restricted to angiosperms. Further assembly and annotation are needed to understand genome structure and gene content in Norway spruce; genome sequences for additional conifers or other lineages of gymnosperms, despite their generally large size, should help clarify the uniqueness of the P. abies genome and provide the information needed for comparative studies that will enable the application of genomic data to forestry, breeding, and analysis of seed plant traits., Despite the relatively small size of most plant genomes sequenced so far, extensive genetic and physical map resources have typically been required for the organization of the sequencing effort and the genome assembly. Therefore, for both scientific and practical reasons, sequencing efforts have focused mostly on genetic models with small genomes. However, as efforts to understand the evolution of plant genes and genomes expand, species will be sequenced solely because of their pivotal phylogenetic position - and these species will probably lack genetic and genomic resources., Fortunately, the emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies, as well as new strategies for genome assembly, now make it possible to generate and assemble high-quality, cost-effective genome sequences for evolutionary models lacking genetic resources. For example, fluorescent in situ hybridization of bacterial artificial chromosomes or other probes, coupled with whole-genome mapping (optical mapping), can be used to guide and validate de novo genome assembly based on next-generation sequencing data. This strategy should be widely applicable to non-model plants with poor genomic resources, thus facilitating whole-genome sequencing and assembly for many other plant species., Technical and analytical breakthroughs provide unprecedented opportunities for gaining new and fundamental insight into genome and organismal evolution across land plants. The Picea genome, at 20 Gb, takes us in a bold new direction. But what genomes to sequence next? A phylogenetic perspective can help identify future targets., Viewing genome size across land-plant phylogeny reveals a dynamic pattern of genome size evolution, with an increase in genome size coincident with the origin of vascular plants, subsequent independent genome reductions in Selaginella and angiosperms, and further increases within some groups of angiosperms (such as monocots; Figure 1). Genome sizes are labile even within gymnosperms; from a large ancestral gymnosperm genome, independent increases occurred in Ephedra (a gnetophyte), Pinaceae, Pinus, and two non-Pinaceae conifers (Sciadopitys and Sequoia, the latter the only known polyploid conifer), and reduction in Gnetum (a gnetophyte), Ginkgo, and most non-Pinaceae conifers [10]. Monilophytes typically have very large genomes and high chromosome numbers, features typically attributed to ancient WGD. Although recent episodes of polyploidy have been documented in many fern genera, there is no compelling evidence for ancient WGD in any monilophyte lineage., These patterns of genome size change raise intriguing questions about the evolution of plant genomes. Through analysis of the P. abies genome, we now know that conifer genomes have expanded through proliferation of LTR-RTs, but does that mechanism apply to other large genomes, such as those of other gymnosperms and monilophytes, especially Psilotaceae and Ophioglossaceae, which have even larger genomes than conifers? Are the large monilophyte genomes comparable in structure and function to the P. abies genome? Do other large plant genomes also have long introns, similar to P. abies? What are the ancestral features of vascular plant genomes? Is genomic obesity the result of LTR-RTs retained from the ancestral vascular plants? What is the structural and functional role of the large chromosomes associated with large genomes? What role, if any, has ancient WGD played in the evolution of large monilophyte genomes? Reductions in genome size have occurred independently in gymnosperms (for example Gnetum), monilophytes (for example, Azolla, a water fern), and angiosperms: did genome downsizing occur by the same mechanism, for example, by repression of transposable element expansion coupled with loss of genetic material?, With the P. abies genome as a reference, analysis of genomes from a cycad, Ginkgo, gnetophyte, and other conifers could reveal how many features of the P. abies genome are actually shared, ancestral features of all gymnosperms and which are unique to conifers. Inclusion of a leptosporangiate fern (Ceratopteris) and a member of Marattiales (Angiopteris), both of which have some genetic resources, and of a lycophyte with a large genome (Lycopodium) would facilitate testing hypotheses of ancestral patterns of genomic change in vascular plants and their underlying mechanisms., Genome sequences carry the keys to understanding genotype-to-phenotype relationships - for features as diverse as morphological characters, biochemical pathways, transcriptional networks, stress response, and more. Increased strategic sampling of plant genomes from across land plants and their green algal relatives will yield unparalleled information on the genes and gene families responsible for the major transitions in plant evolutionary history - the move onto land and the origins of vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers - as well as the genes controlling traits that could be harnessed for human benefit."

Biotechnology of these plants will be important for a sustainable feedstock supply. Herein, we review knowledge useful for their improvement and synergies gained by their parallel study., The replacement of fossil fuels by biofuels is an ongoing effort in many countries. With decreasing oil reserves and increasing fossil fuel prices, bioenergy is a promising alternative. Advantages of biofuels can include a positive energy balance, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and indirect effects, such as rural development. Studies based on life-cycle analysis conclude that when ethanol from sugarcane is used to replace fossil fuels in transportation, a substantial reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions may result (from 80% to greater than 100% savings [1]). Biomass can also be used to generate electricity, with electric vehicles presenting several advantages over combustion engines. Wood, cellulose and biofuel generation of electricity and stationary generation of energy can be very efficient and are also being implemented as options. In the last 5 years we have seen a 109% increase in global biofuel production. World projections provided by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicate further increases in bioethanol and biodiesel production from the present 140 billion liters to 221 billion liters in 2021, corresponding to an additional 60% increase., Increased biofuel production, and the associated increase in production of energy feedstocks, raises sustainability concerns over issues such as changes in land use, competition between energy crops and food and feed crops, and impacts on ecosystem services, including soil and water resources. Mandates in several countries to substitute gasoline for bioethanol require a substantial contribution from advanced fuels (sugar-derived and/or lignocellulosic bioethanol) to guarantee a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions., Which plants are best suited to the requirements of future bioenergy feedstocks? To produce energy from plant-fixed C-bonds, crops should be high yielding, fast growing, with C-bonds that are easy to convert to useful forms, and require relatively small energy inputs for growth and harvest. To achieve sustainability, energy crops should not require extensive use of prime agricultural lands and they should have a low cost of energy production from biomass. Both the realities of agriculture in environments that are always heterogeneous and energy security require that feedstocks include a portfolio of diverse crops rather than merely a single crop., A strong case can be made that members of the Saccharinae subtribe, particularly Saccharum (sugarcane and energy cane), Miscanthus and Sorghum species (Figure 1), best encompass these requirements. For commercial markets to develop, these crops are being evaluated with respect to their productivity as perennial crops (ratoon) in short growing seasons under different conditions, such as periodic drought, low temperatures and low nutrient inputs [2]. A recent development includes breeding efforts to produce an 'energy cane' (Saccharum species or interspecific hybrid) more amenable for hydrolysis of the bagasse and straw lignocellulosic fibers. The high yield of Saccharum (sugarcane) in tropical climates is particularly well documented, and Miscanthus and sorghum show similar promise in temperate climates. Herein, we review the merits of these grasses as a complementary package of bioenergy feedstock crops, the state of knowledge useful for their study and improvement, and synergies that might be gained by their parallel study.

                    , Within the Andropogoneae grasses, sugarcane (Saccharum) and Miscanthus belong to the Saccharinae subtribe. Sorghum has been considered a member of the Sorghinae subtribe, although more recently a good case has been made (that we will accept herein) for expanding the Saccharinae to include the Sorghinae [3]., Sugarcane is a common name of a group of predominantly tropical species that originated in Southeast Asia (Table 1). Modern varieties result from crosses of the sucrose-accumulating relative Saccharum officinarum and the wild relative Saccharum spontaneum, with contributions from Saccharum robustum, Saccharum sinense, Saccharum barberi, Erianthus and Miscanthus [4, 5]. Commercial varieties have the remarkable capability of storing high sucrose levels in the stem that can reach 40% of dry weight [6]. In a study of sugarcane yields across the world, commercial maximum cane yield averaged 69 t ha-1 year-1 and the experimental maximum averaged 98 t ha-1 year-1 in the countries with the highest sunlight [7]. Today, commercial yields closer to the experimental maximum are frequently reported. Sugarcane average annual production per hectare (39 t ha-1 of dry stalks and trash) compares favorably with other high-yield bioenergy crops such as Miscanthus (29.6 t ha-1) and switchgrass (10.4 t ha-1) [8] (Table 2). Estimates from field trials show an average yield of 22.8 and 12.2 t ha-1 for sugarcane ancestral species S. spontaneum and S. officinarum, respectively [9].Table 1

                          29.6[8], Complementing the tropical adaptation of Saccharum, with most species native to eastern or southeastern Asia [10], its adaptability to continental Europe [11–13] shows the feasibility of producing Miscanthus in temperate latitudes (Table 1). Miscanthus × giganteus, a sterile, vegetatively propagated hybrid (2n = 3x = 57) believed to originate from crosses between tetraploid Miscanthus sacchariflorus and diploid Miscanthus sinensis [14], generally produces high yields, similar to (and in some cases better than) other biomass crops [8, 15]. Considerable leveraging of breeding, production and processing infrastructure might be gained by the close relationship of Miscanthus to Saccharum - thought to be the closest relatives of one another, and polyphyletic [16]. Saccharum × Miscanthus hybrids ('Miscanes') have been used for sugarcane improvement [17–19], and also show promise as a highly productive cellulosic biomass crop., Increased demand for limited fresh water, along with rising global temperatures and aridity, suggest that sustainable future biomass production will have to occur using little or no irrigation, highlighting an important role of sorghum in a portfolio of bioenergy crops. One of the most drought tolerant of cereal crops thanks to its origins in Sudan and Ethiopia [20], the multifaceted history of sorghum improvement offers a wider range of genetic variations than found in many crops, exemplified by the fact that sorghum is one of the few crops suited to all proposed approaches for renewable fuel production (such as from starch, sugar, and/or cellulose; Table 1). About 30% of the US sorghum crop is presently used as feedstock in the grain-to-ethanol process, which has also been commercialized in India and China. The completely sequenced genome of sorghum, which has the further advantages of being relatively small and with minimal gene duplication [21], together with transformation potential, knowledge of cell wall composition and architecture and other features ([22] and references therein), make sorghum an important model for research concerning bioenergy grasses [22, 23]., Plants in the Andropogoneae use C4 photosynthesis (Box 1), which avoids photorespiration, leading to higher maximal photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency than the C3 pathway used by rice, wheat and many other grasses [5, 24], resulting in more biomass accumulation. In elevated CO2 conditions, the C4 grasses sugarcane [25], maize and sorghum [26] show better responses to drought stress than C3 grasses. Plants in the Saccharinae have some further advantages in comparison with other C4 grasses, such as maize. First, many routinely produce a 'ratoon' crop, regrowing after harvest and thus eliminating the need for replanting each year. Indeed, the Sorghum genus, with annual and perennial species that are genetically compatible, has become a botanical model for study of attributes related to perenniality [27–29]. Second, sugarcane and Miscanthus have lower nitrogen-input requirements [13, 30], and the latter can relocate some nutrients from aerial parts to the roots and/or rhizomes at the end of the growing season [31]. Third, some reports show better photosynthetic features of Saccharinae plants than other Andropogoneae. Light interception by the leaves is higher in Miscanthus than in maize [15] and Miscanthus can sustain higher levels of CO2 assimilation than maize in lower temperatures [32]. Sugarcane photosynthesis is enhanced in elevated CO2 in open-top chambers, increasing biomass productivity [33], which does not occur in maize grown in open-air elevation of CO2 [34]. However, this finding is controversial since enclosure and open-air studies give different results for the same crop, and some authors argue that enclosed studies are not the best scenario to mimic future increases in CO2 concentration [35]. Moreover, experiments with Miscanthus in ambient and open-air elevation of CO2 show no differences in yield [36]., Since lignocellulosic biofuels use the plant cell wall as a source for fermentable sugars, it is important to understand the composition and architecture of the cell wall to develop strategies to degrade it efficiently. Grasses present a particular cell wall structure and composition (Figure 2), making a 'type II' cell wall that differs substantially from the 'type I' cell walls of other feedstocks, such as wood species [22, 37, 38]. This also implies the evolution of different gene families involved in the synthesis of the cell wall [22]. Recently, a model for sugarcane cell wall architecture and for hierarchical enzymatic hydrolysis was proposed [39]. By understanding the structure of the cell wall, it is possible to choose the best method to improve hydrolysis yield, and design breeding strategies or develop improved procedures to recover the released carbohydrates.

                        Simplified schematic representation of the cell wall. The wall is shown as a transverse section. Grasses and non-grass angiosperms possess different types of cell wall. The text in red denotes the main differences. Surrounding the cellulose microfibrils, the inner and outer hemicellulose circles show tightly and loosely bound polysaccharides, respectively. Grasses have glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAX) as the main cross-linking hemicellulose and a primary wall matrix enriched in mixed-linkage glucans, with lower pectin content. The thin red boundary in the primary wall of the grasses denotes the phenolic compounds, mainly ferulic acid, linked to GAX molecules. In grasses, seven cellulose microfibrils can be structured in a cellulose macrofibril. Typically, grasses have more lignin than other angiosperms. Non-grasses possess xyloglucan as the major cross-linking hemicellulose, a pectin-based matrix and structural proteins. In the secondary wall, note that pectins and mixed-linkage glucans are minor components. Also, we can see lignin forming a structural barrier surrounding the carbohydrates.

                    , Improvements in sorghum are characteristic of many other major food and feed crops, and Miscanthus improvement is just beginning; examining sugarcane improvement therefore exemplifies the methods and approaches likely to be employed in biofuel grasses., Sugarcane improvement efforts follow both molecular-assisted breeding and transgenic routes [40]. S. officinarum is a plant with high sugar content in its stems but low productivity, and S. spontaneum has high tillering and biomass yield but low sugar accumulation. Modern sugarcane cultivars derive from a few crosses between S. officinarum and S. spontaneum and have been shown to be genetically very similar [41]. Breeding programs have been able to increase yield and sucrose content by crossing cultivars but gains are becoming slimmer. To continue the improvement of yield it may be necessary to turn back to ancestral genotypes and broaden the genetic basis of crosses. S. spontaneum and S. robustum are also being used as parents, with the goal of designing a crop more amenable for cellulosic biofuel production, with increased stress tolerance and increased yield but less emphasis on stalk sugar concentration, the so-called 'energy cane'. World collections of Saccharum germplasm are held in Florida [42] and India [43], which keep ancestral genotypes and cultivars, and many private collections are also kept and used for crosses in specific breeding programs. Each world collection has over 1,500 accessions of ancestral genotypes, most of them S. officinarum (about 750), S. spontaneum (about 600) and S. robustum (about 130), and 500 to 1,000 hybrids or cultivars. Sorghum, like sugarcane, has large germplasm collections held by the US National Plant Germplasm System and at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT, the CGIAR center with a sorghum improvement mandate). Only a few small Miscanthus collections are held publicly, but several private collections associated with breeding programs are similar in size to the Saccharum collections., Crosses between members of the Saccharinae are viable. In fact, sugarcane has been crossed to both Miscanthus and sorghum, generating viable progenies, and the strategy has been used to incorporate cold and drought resistance traits from Miscanthus into sugarcane [19]., The transformation of sugarcane is becoming an interesting and growing field. Methods for transformation are already established with efforts aimed mostly at sugar yield and quality [44–46], disease resistance [47, 48], and the use of sugarcane as a biofactory to produce high-value bioproducts [49, 50]. For biofuel production, some approaches show interesting results, with lower biomass recalcitrance [51] and expression and accumulation of microbial cellulolytic enzymes in sugarcane leaves [52] to improve biomass hydrolysis. The most widely used promoters are the constitutive CaMV 35S and maize ubi1, but sugarcane promoters have already been used or characterized, including tissue-specific [46, 47] and responsive promoters [53]. However, sugarcane transformation is not a trivial task since problems such as transgene silencing frequently occur ([40, 54] and references therein). Sorghum transformation is also routine (although at lower efficiency than in some crops [55]), and Miscanthus transformation methods have been established [56]., For both molecular-assisted and transgenic strategies outlined above, the availability of a reference genome sequence is highly desirable, as well as the definition of the complete complement of genes and proteins. For the Saccharinae, the relatively small (740 Mb) and diploid genome of sorghum, which has not experienced genome duplication in about 70 million years [21], has become the best reference for genomics and transcriptomics in sugarcane [57]. Nonetheless, the sugarcane genome itself is being sequenced using a combination of approaches. In a first phase, researchers are sequencing bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) combined with whole-genome shot-gun sequencing to produce a reference genome [58]. Currently, three sugarcane BAC libraries are available; from variety R570 [59], selfed progenies of R570 [60] and SP80-3280 [61]. The two former libraries have 103,000 to 110,000 clones comprising about 12 times coverage of the basic genome complement but only about 1.3 to 1.4 times coverage of the individual alleles. The latter library has about 36,000 clones, and all three have inserts of about 125 to 130 kb. BAC sequencing has enabled research to deduce synteny and collinearity of much of the sugarcane genome with other grasses, especially sorghum, particularly in genic regions [61–63]. Unaligned regions between sorghum and sugarcane genomes are largely repetitive [62], enriched in transposon-related sequences [61, 63]. Consistent with several genetic mapping efforts, the sequencing of BAC clones revealed high levels of gene structure/sequence conservation and collinearity among hom(oe)ologous haplotypes of the sugarcane genome [64], and several putative sugarcane-specific genes/sequences [61–63]. Groups from Australia, Brazil, France, South Africa and the USA are advancing these efforts in genome sequencing, increasing the number of BACs sequenced and producing shot-gun data of several cultivars. It is expected that reference genome sequences will be made available for both cultivars and ancestral genotypes [65] and, to that end, researchers are developing statistical models using SNPs where homology groups with any ploidy level may be estimated [66]. This will be essential to obtain a saturated genetic map of the sugarcane genome that may aid genome assembly. The greatest challenge that distinguishes the sequencing of Saccharum and Miscanthus from the more tractable genomes of sorghum and other cereal models is large physical size (approximately 10 Gb) and large copy numbers of even 'low-copy' elements (8 to 12 in sugarcane; 4 to 6 in Miscanthus). During assembly of such genomes, many closely related alleles 'collapse' into single gene/element models that fail to capture allelic and perhaps also paralogous diversity within even a single genotype. The sorghum genome will greatly help in the assembly, but around 20% of the sugarcane expression sequence tags (ESTs) from the SUCEST project [67] appear to be specific to sugarcane, since they do not match sorghum, Miscanthus, maize, rice or Brachypodium [68], requiring other strategies in the assembly. Linkage maps based on molecular markers have shown synteny and collinearity of sorghum and sugarcane genomes, but are complicated to make in sugarcane due to the polyploidy and absence of inbred lines ([69] and references therein). This problem was partly overcome with the use of single-dose markers [70], which segregate in a 1:1 ratio in the gametes of a heterozygous genotype, and account for approximately 70% of polymorphic loci in sugarcane [71]. However, among 20 to 30 linkage maps based on a few thousand markers available for sugarcane ([71, 72] and references therein), it remains true that only 33% to 60% of the sugarcane genome is represented on these maps [71]. A recent development that may help breeders in marker-assisted selection efforts has been the development of an algorithm and software (ONEMAP) for constructing linkage maps of outcrossing plant species that has been successfully applied to sugarcane [73]. Enriched mapping of DNA polymorphisms that also provide for deconvolution of closely related sequences may also aid in assembly of such highly polyploid genomes., Changes in gene expression associated with allopolyploidy are well known, but sugarcane functional genomics is a challenge due the complexity of its largely autopolyploid and aneuploid genome and the absence of a reference sequence. Again, the sorghum genome has been serving as a reference to define putative transcripts. The sorghum transcriptome has been studied by different high-throughput technologies such as cDNA microarrays and massively parallel sequencing (Tables 3 and 4) to understand the expression profiling and biological function of genes in response to herbivory, biotic and abiotic stress in different tissues and treatments [68], and how the genes and their structural/functional changes contribute to the morphological variations between sorghum lines integrating genome evolution and expression divergence [74]. Deep RNA sequencing methods have overcome many limitations of microarray technologies and have allowed recent studies to reveal sorghum genes, gene networks, and a strong interplay among various metabolic pathways in different treatments [75], as well as the identification of particular paralogs that putatively encode enzymes involved in specific metabolic networks [76].Table 3

                  , Despite the absence of a sequenced genome and the complexities associated with the presence of about 8 to 12 copies of each gene, functional genomics has made considerable progress towards understanding unique biological attributes of sugarcane. These studies assist in the development of new applications for bioenergy, biomaterial industries and improved 'energy' cultivars [57]. The fundamental databases and resources for studies of functional genomics in sugarcane have been reviewed recently [57, 77, 78] and a sugarcane computational environment (SUCEST-FUN Database) has been developed for storage, retrieval and integration of genome sequencing, transcriptome, expression profiling, gene catalogs, physiology measures and transgenic plant data [79]. Studies on sugarcane gene expression have been based mainly on EST information from different tissues, treatments and genotypes. The largest contribution to the available ESTs (>80%) comes from the SUCEST project [67], and most of the remainder comes from Australia, USA, South Africa and India (reviewed by [57, 68]). To obtain a less redundant dataset including ESTs not sampled by the SUCEST project, a comparison with SoGI [80] was carried out and 8,106 sequences lacking detectable similarity to SAS (sugarcane assembled sequences) were identified. The clustering strategy in SoGI produces redundant clusters and makes the SUCEST assembly more appropriate for gene and orthology-based analysis [81]. The SUCEST-FUN project and SAS sequences have been updated with the whole sugarcane ESTs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and compared with the SoGI assembly (Table 5). A total of 282,683 ESTs are currently catalogued in the SUCEST-FUN Database.Table 5

                  , Comparison of ESTs from sorghum with sugarcane, maize and rice has revealed mean sequence identities of 97%, 93% and 86%, respectively, indicating a close relationship between sorghum and sugarcane (Figure S7 of [21]). A total of 39,021 sugarcane proteins were predicted from 43,141 clusters [67] using ESTScan [82] and the Oryza sativa matrix (Table 5). Putative orthologs and paralogs were identified by pairwise proteome comparisons with InParanoid software [83]. With the aid of MultiParanoid software [84], we found orthology relationships among multiple proteomes (Table 6). The analysis encompassed a comparison among five species: Saccharum sp., Sorghum bicolor, Zea mays, O. sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana. Proteins were grouped into 18,611 orthologous clusters. A total of 16,723 sugarcane proteins found 13,804 orthologs in sorghum, 22,312 in maize, 16,913 in rice and 13,998 in Arabidopsis, with a confidence score ≥0.05 and group merging cut-off >0.5 using the BLOSUM80 matrix, suitable for closely related sequences (Table 6).Table 6

                          35,38613,99822,165, The sugarcane transcriptome has been studied using technologies, including cDNA macroarrays (nylon membranes), cDNA microarrays spotted onto glass slides, and oligonucleotide arrays either spotted or synthesized in situ. A summary of the available platforms, samples and related works for sugarcane and sorghum using array technologies is shown in Table 3 and has been reviewed recently [57, 68, 78, 85]. Sugarcane transcriptomics has identified genes associated with sucrose content, biotic and abiotic stresses, photosynthesis, carbon partitioning and roles of phytohormones and signaling pathways in adaptive responses. These studies also allowed for the identification of promoters that can be used to drive transgene components in a tissue-specific or controlled manner. Several other methods to study sugarcane expression profiles at a moderate scale have been used to confirm the expression patterns observed in large-scale transcript studies [57]., More recently, the use of oligoarrays has included studies on the regulation of antisense gene expression in sugarcane, pointing to a role for these transcripts in drought responses [86]. Some years ago, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in sugarcane revealed an unexpectedly high proportion of antisense transcripts and chimeric SAGE [87]. High-throughput sequencing (Table 4) is useful for assessing transcriptomes, providing detailed information for transcript variants, particularly SNPs, assessment of the expression of hom(oe)ologous alleles in the polyploid genome, spliced isoforms and so on [88]. Using this strategy, some sugarcane genes were characterized for SNP density and gene haplotypes across varieties [89]. In recent studies, it has become apparent that small RNAs, particularly microRNAs, have important regulatory roles in sugarcane, playing a key role in development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses [90–92]. Evidence suggests that long terminal repeat retrotransposon (LTR-RT) families may affect nearby genes by generating a diverse set of small RNAs that trigger gene-silencing mechanisms [93]., In contrast to sorghum and sugarcane, genomic and transcriptomic studies on Miscanthus are just beginning. The recent high-throughput sequencing of its genome and transcriptome identified the presence of repeats that are actively producing small RNAs [94], and the construction of a genetic map identified informative simple sequence repeats in sugarcane and a genome-wide duplication in Miscanthus relative to S. bicolor [95]. These studies will increase the understanding of complex genomes [96]., The Saccharinae grasses sugarcane, Miscanthus and sorghum are promising and complementary elements of a portfolio of bioenergy feedstocks. As sustainability criteria take dominant roles in the commercialization of biomass sources, these plants are likely to contribute to provide cheap, reliable and politically viable options for bioenergy production. Biotechnology for these crops is less advanced than in food crops such as maize and rice, but it is progressing quickly. Many efforts are underway to define genes associated with traits of interest such as sucrose content, drought tolerance, yield and adaptation to climate changes, and much is known about genes and markers for the improvement of these crops. Breeding programs are improving germplasm collections and defining routes to speed up selection of progenies and choice of ideal parents for crossing. It is expected that prudent integration of conventional breeding methods with marker-assisted and transgenic options may increase the (currently slow) rates of yield improvement, decreasing the amount of land required for large-scale biofuel production, as well as the need for inputs such as water, herbicides and fertilizers to maintain economical levels of production. Finally, the transition to a more biobased economy may be expedited by the increased value of biobased chemicals that might be harvested from the production chain through the adoption of integrated biorefinery systems. Better understanding of and greater control over carbon partitioning in these plants may greatly increase the number of co-products, including bioethanol, biodiesel, biokerosene, bioplastics and bioelectricity to name a few., Many of the most productive agricultural crops use the C4 photosynthetic pathway to increase net carbon assimilation at high temperature (Figure 3, adapted from [97]). Discovered in sugarcane [98], C4 photosynthesis may have been an adaptation to hot, dry environments or CO2 deficiency [99–102], and appears to have evolved repeatedly from ancestors that used C3 photosynthesis [103, 104], including multiple origins within some angiosperm families [105, 106]. Most C4 plants are grasses, including the entire Andropogoneae tribe (including sorghum, sugarcane and Miscanthus), and it has been inferred that C4 photosynthesis first arose in grasses during the Oligocene epoch (24 to 35 million years ago) [107, 108]. The high photosynthetic capacity of C4 plants is achieved by CO2 assimilation in mesophyll cells (by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase together with carbonic anhydrase to facilitate rapid equilibrium between CO2 and HCO3-) then diffusion of the resulting C4 acids into bundle sheath cells, where CO2 is discharged by various decarboxylases at up to 10-fold higher than atmospheric level at the site of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco), the primary enzyme of C3 photosynthesis. This high CO2 concentration mitigates wasteful fixation of oxygen by Rubisco, reducing photorespiration, or CO2 loss during C3 photosynthesis, at high temperatures [109]. C4 plants are classified in part based on the type of decarboxylases used in the bundle sheath: NADP malic enzyme, NAD malic enzyme or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

This paper discusses experimental and analytical approaches to deriving causal relationships in gene regulatory networks., Owing to their sessile mode of life, plants are subject to drastic variations in their environment that lead to rapid adaptation of their gene expression states resulting from their complex gene-regulatory networks. The ultimate goal in plant systems biology is to infer, for both scientific and practical gain, how such regulatory networks will respond under untested conditions. In prokaryotes, models to infer gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) have successfully predicted genome-wide variations in untested environmental conditions, as well as the causal relationships between genes [1–4]. However, there has been less success in generating predictive network models for multicellular organisms, including plants. With the increasing availability of high-throughput '-omic' techniques and data, we think it useful to summarize both experimental and informatic approaches for inferring causal relationships in GRNs. Here, we use the term GRN to refer to the set of transcriptional interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their targets, as opposed to a multimodal set of gene-to-gene or gene-to-metabolite interactions., Here, we have three aims: first, to summarize efforts to use time-series and other -omic data to infer causal regulatory edges, showing the kinds of biological insights that can be obtained; next to provide a description and a categorization of the informatic methods that are being used to infer causal networks; and finally to discuss recent high-throughput experimental techniques to validate inferred GRNs in plants., Different kinds of systems approaches are used to model GRNs in plants. One way of characterizing these systems approaches is dependent on whether or not they start with a significant amount of prior experimental knowledge of the connectivity of the modeled GRN. Thus, in this article, we call them 'Strong Prior' and 'Weak Prior' approaches, respectively., Inferring a causal edge between objects is useful in many applications in plant biology, from genomics to ecology. If some population of objects A can cause an increase in the population of object B (where A could be a gene in our context, a hormone or a species in ecology), then lowering the population of B can be achieved by: (i) removing some members of B, (ii) removing some members of A or (iii) interfering with the edge from A to B. Conversely, making B achieve a higher population can be achieved by: (i) adding more members of B, (ii) adding more members of A or (iii) enhancing the efficiency of the edge from A to B. Commonly, causal relationships in biology can involve several elements, for example A1 to A5, influencing some B, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively. The influences can be 'linear', in which case each element has either a positive or negative weight (or coefficient), or 'non-linear', in which case the elements work synergistically. An example of synergy would be a dependency of B on the product of the concentrations of some genes X and Y., Generally, simpler models scale to larger numbers of genes, but are less informative, as summarized by the classes of network-inference methods listed in Table 1. Virtually all approaches deteriorate as the size of networks becomes larger, some more than others. Fortunately, biology tends to be modular, so large analyses can be broken down into smaller ones and then recombined [5].Table 1

                    It is clear that there is a trade-off between information richness (the number of factors that can be applied to predict gene expression) and the size of the analyzed network. Small networks can be handled by methods that are highly complex and information rich (many linear and non-linear factors can influence a gene within the method). Combining several small network modules holds the potential to analyze a large network [5], although this might not always work.
                  , The approaches to network inference fall into the following categories, which can be classified based on level of information richness (low, medium and high) and scalability of the derived network (large, medium and small networks), as shown in Table 1. High information richness would, for example, allow the inference of the dynamic behavior of a network [21], whereas low information richness would give some approximation to the connectivity of a causal GRN., Correlation techniques are techniques that try to find single source-target relationships. To try to isolate the possibly mutual influence of one gene on another, many researchers make use of partial correlations. Schaefer and Strimmer [33] and Ingkasuwan et al. [29] have presented an analysis of graphical Gaussian models. These models assume a Gaussian noise distribution and try to infer partial correlations (gene X influences gene Y, while holding the effects of other genes constant). Partial correlations can be computed indirectly by calculating regressions and correlations among the residuals. Such analyses require heuristic approximations for large networks because the number of experiments (for example, microarrays) is always far fewer than the number of genes. Thus, partial-correlation approaches can result in medium-sized networks (up to 100 genes) (Table 1)., Like correlation, 'mutual information' [28] seeks pairwise relationships among variables without assumptions of linear or rank dependencies. Also, like correlation, mutual information can be used for large-scale networks and does not try to compute the weight of influence of one gene on another in predicting the expression value of the target., Use of differential equations, often based on mass action, yields equations of the form: Rate of change in gene A concentration = Synthesis rate - Decay rate. Such approaches work especially well for small, information-rich networks such as the auxin networks mentioned above [5, 34]. An issue with the mass-action approach is that it assumes that different inputs interact in a multiplicative manner (product of concentration of each component), whereas the interaction is likely to be more complex in biological, as opposed to chemical, settings., An alternative approach to network inference is to use a Boolean approach, which allows other logical relationships among regulators and their targets [5, 10, 12]. Logic gates are based on thresholds - for example, an 'AND gate' will have an effect on target if the minimum input reaches a certain threshold, thus permitting non-linear relationships. These tend to work better on smaller networks than linear equations and better than multiplicative relationships in modeling regulation (Table 1)., Closely related to Boolean approaches are decision/regression tree approaches that embody paths of threshold tests (where each path represents a Boolean conjunction of conditions) leading to a prediction (for example, of expression values). 'Gene network inference with ensemble of trees 3' (GENIE3) is a regression tree algorithm that can be applied to steady-state, time-series and/or mutational transcriptome data [35]. This approach has worked particularly well in 'dialogue for reverse engineering assessments and methods 3' (DREAM3) competitions that use in silico data as benchmarks for validating the predictive power of inferred networks [36]., 'Integrative genomic' techniques analyze how changes can cause divergent behavior over time [37]. The idea is that genes are in some steady-state before some perturbation occurs, and the technique follows the genes that change first, that change second and so on to try to guess causality. This is the qualitative idea behind the differential-equation approaches., Pipeline approaches typically combine different algorithms on different data types. For example, the Inferelator is a network-inference approach that uses differential-equation techniques and mutual information to integrate many different data types, including steady-state, time-series and mutation/perturbation data [38, 39]. These algorithms treat knowledge in a pipelined fashion. Thus, if physical experiments show that a target gene Z has potential connections from X and Y but not from W, then only X and Y will be considered in the subsequent analysis. The time-series-based inference algorithm then might use these potential edges to derive an ordinary differential-equation model that can combine linear and non-linear terms. The result of such a pipeline is a set of equations that estimate the change in transcription level of a target gene based on transcriptional levels of other genes using time-series data. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of such pipeline approaches, which refine large, information-poor networks into smaller, information-rich networks with predictive power.

                        An experimental/computational systems-biology cycle using different data types and feedback. Starting from many possible edges, different data types and their analyses successively reduce the size of the network, while increasing confidence in edges. (1) Correlation leads to pairwise associations of genes. (2) Transgenic manipulation permits the determination of the effect of mutations and overexpression of single genes. (3) Binding experiments (for example, Chip-Seq) reveals physical connectivity of a source gene to a target. (4) Time-series experiments along with machine-learning techniques lead to a weighted network where the weight on the edge from A to B determines the extent of influence of A on B. (5) Subsequent predictions followed by validations can then suggest the need for new experimentation, thus refueling the systems-biology cycle.
                    , Finally, other work importantly suggests trying many network-inference methods in combination [20], showing empirically that a combination of strategies often leads to the best network resolution and supporting the widespread popular use of the 'wisdom of crowds' concept., GRN modeling described in the above sections complements genetic studies and generates hypotheses for TF-target interactions to be tested, thus inspiring a new round of the systems-biology cycle of high-throughput experimentation for model validation and refinement (Figure 1). A variety of methods have been used to uncover the global structure of gene networks by inferring regulatory relationships between TFs and their target genes from genomic data [6, 40–43], in particular transcriptional analysis and chromatin immuno-precipitation., The most common approach has been TF perturbation in stable overexpression or knockout/knockdown lines, followed by transcriptional analysis [44–47]. However, it remains unclear in such analyses whether changes in transcript levels are a direct consequence of TF manipulation or whether these changes are caused by indirect or possibly pleiotropic effects. To overcome the limitation of this approach, several other techniques have been used to supplement transcriptional data, including yeast one-hybrid assays [40] and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays [48–50]. However, while these methods can result in a significant enrichment of direct targets, they are often time-consuming and not easily applicable to high-throughput analyses., The introduction of ChIP-X, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) or tiling array (ChIP-chip) has greatly improved the genome-wide identification of TF binding sites and has uncovered many potential direct targets [51–53]. Importantly, although ChIP-X reveals the binding of a TF onto a promoter, it does not indicate whether this results in activation/repression of gene expression [54]. Therefore, ChIP-X has often been combined with genome-wide transcriptional analysis to characterize the primary targets of a TF [55–57]., Recently, novel combinations of these technologies have yielded vastly improved knowledge about interactions between TFs and their targets. For example, whole-plant studies using dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible TF translocation into the nucleus followed by separate ChIP-X experiments identified target genes both bound and regulated by a TF of interest [58–60]. Another new technology was recently described by Bargmann and colleagues [61] in which a protoplast system combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) has been employed to scale-up validation of GRNs in vivo. Briefly, plant protoplasts are transformed with plasmid harboring a fluorescent selection marker together with the over-expression of a TF of interest fused to a glucocorticoid receptor from rat. Co-treatment of protoplasts with DEX and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, which blocks secondary-target responses, results in the identification of only primary TF targets. This rapid technique makes it possible to perform high-throughput investigations/validations of TFs and the GRNs they regulate in plants [61]. Data from such high-throughput TF-target validations can then be fed-back into network-inference pipelines to refine predicted edges in the derived GRNs, in a true systems-biology cycle (Figure 1)."

Quantitative trait loci for these traits have been introgressed from a dwarf temperate donor into hundreds of diverse sorghum landraces to yield the Sorghum Conversion lines. Here, we report the first comprehensive genomic analysis of the molecular changes underlying this adaptation., We apply genotyping-by-sequencing to 1,160 Sorghum Conversion lines and their exotic progenitors, and map donor introgressions in each Sorghum Conversion line. Many Sorghum Conversion lines carry unexpected haplotypes not found in either presumed parent. Genome-wide mapping of introgression frequencies reveals three genomic regions necessary for temperate adaptation across all Sorghum Conversion lines, containing the Dw1, Dw2, and Dw3 loci on chromosomes 9, 6, and 7 respectively. Association mapping of plant height and flowering time in Sorghum Conversion lines detects significant associations in the Dw1 but not the Dw2 or Dw3 regions. Subpopulation-specific introgression mapping suggests that chromosome 6 contains at least four loci required for temperate adaptation in different sorghum genetic backgrounds. The Dw1 region fractionates into separate quantitative trait loci for plant height and flowering time., Generating Sorghum Conversion lines has been accompanied by substantial unintended gene flow. Sorghum adaptation to temperate-zone grain production involves a small number of genomic regions, each containing multiple linked loci for plant height and flowering time. Further characterization of these loci will accelerate the adaptation of sorghum and related grasses to new production systems for food and fuel.","Genotyping-by-sequencing, introgression, photoperiod, flowering time, dwarfism","Cereals have been selected by humans for thousands of years, first during their domestication from wild grasses and subsequently for increased yield, uniformity, and adaptation to new environments and management practices [1–3]. Specific molecular pathways have recently proven useful for cereal adaptation to modern, high-input agriculture. For example, the Green Revolution exploited allelic variation in the gibberellin pathway in wheat and rice to produce semi-dwarf cultivars with increased harvest index and improved resistance to lodging [4–7]. Similar phenotypic changes occurred during the creation of dwarf grain sorghum suitable for mechanized harvest at temperate latitudes. Understanding the genetic control of these changes is critical for the efficient transfer of useful alleles, both between tropical and temperate growing regions and between breeding programs for different end uses., Sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop worldwide [8] and is widely grown in temperate regions, but was domesticated in the African tropics [9]. Temperate adaptation for grain production in sorghum requires photoperiod-insensitivity, for early maturity, and dwarfism, both of which involve at least four major loci [10]. Of the major maturity loci (Ma1-Ma6), Ma1 has been identified as PRR37 [11] and Ma3 as Phytochrome B [12]. Of the major dwarfing loci (Dw1-Dw4), Dw3 has been identified as PGP1/PGP19, an auxin transporter orthologous to maize brachytic2 [13]. Dw2 and Dw1 are uncloned, with the former closely-linked to Ma1 [14] and the latter mapping to chromosome 9 [15, 16]., The oligogenic control of these important agronomic traits in sorghum was exploited through a backcross breeding scheme known as the Sorghum Conversion Program (SCP) [17]. Mutations for photoperiod-sensitivity and dwarfism had previously arisen spontaneously in temperate regions of Africa, Asia, and the southern US, and were already being used for grain sorghum production. However, the genetic base of US grain sorghum remained very narrow. During the SCP, genomic regions conferring early maturity and dwarfing were introgressed from an elite donor into approximately 800 exotic sorghum accessions representing the breadth of genetic diversity in sorghum. The resulting SC lines are closely related to their Exotic Progenitor (EP) lines, but differ dramatically in plant height and flowering time due to the presence of donor introgressions (Figure 1A). The elite donor, BTx406, carries recessive alleles for photoperiod-insensitivity and dwarfism at Ma1 and Dw1-Dw3, respectively [17], so these loci are expected to show a high frequency of donor introgression in SC lines. Klein et al. [14] previously mapped introgressions on chromosome 6 in a subset of SC lines and showed that several of them contain vast introgressed tracts around the linked Ma1-Dw2 loci. However, the genetic architecture of temperate adaptation in the SC lines (the number and linkage of loci as well as their frequencies in different subpopulations) has not been systematically studied on a genome-wide basis. This information can be used both to identify the underlying targets of the SCP and to help guide more efficient, marker-directed conversion of exotic sorghums to temperate-adapted varieties.

Four generations of backcrossing were completed, with selection during each F2 generation for short, photoperiod-insensitive plants. (B) Interpretation of molecular data from donor, SC, and EP lines. SC alleles shared with either the donor or EP lines indicate that introgression has occurred (orange) or not occurred (blue), respectively. SC alleles not found in either parent are unexpected (purple) and were treated as missing data. (C) Genome content of 580 SC lines. Each vertical bar represents a single SC line. Bars are ordered by the percentage of unexpected genotypes. The solid black vertical line indicates a cutoff of 10% unexpected genotypes.

(E) A representative example of the introgression maps created for each SC line. The 10 sorghum chromosomes are shown from left to right. The 11th column displays unanchored contigs in the sorghum genome. Long-range linkage disequilibrium in SC lines was exploited to place these contigs on the sorghum physical map.
                    , In this study, we use genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) [18, 19] to generate genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 580 pairs of EP and SC lines, for a total of 1,160 sorghum inbreds. We then employ a novel introgression mapping approach to identify loci required for temperate adaptation, and validate our results using both phenotype-genotype association and population differentiation (Fst) analyses., The molecular analysis of parents and progeny provides the opportunity for pedigree verification. Our results show that almost one-third of SC lines contain a substantial proportion of unexpected genotypes (>10% of informative markers). We used three complementary approaches - introgression mapping, association mapping, and population differentiation (Fst) - to characterize the genetic architecture of adaptation to temperate-zone grain production in sorghum. Our novel introgression mapping strategy exploited recombination and selection previously imposed by plant breeders to map three major genomic regions, one of which no longer harbors functional variation in temperate-adapted SC lines. Association mapping confirmed that the Dw1 region contains separate QTL for plant height and flowering time. Significant differences in introgression frequency between subpopulations strongly suggest the existence of additional uncharacterized loci that affect plant height and flowering time in sorghum., Linkage disequilibrium between at least four targeted loci on chromosome 6 has led to the introgression of a single elite haplotype across most of this chromosome in the majority of lines examined. Chromosome 6 contains roughly 10% of sorghum genes, for which very little functional diversity has been exploited for temperate sorghum breeding. This lack of diversity undoubtedly limits adaptive potential, especially for complex traits including resistance to abiotic and/or biotic stress. Increasing gene flow and recombination between tropical and temperate sorghum varieties and haplotypes will help unlock the genetic potential of this stress-tolerant crop to meet our rising demand for food, feed, and fuel in an era of increasing climatic volatility."
"102","Interactions of beneficial and detrimental root-colonizing filamentous microbes with plant hosts","Thomas Rey, Sebastian Schornack","Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge, The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich Research Park","Sebastian Schornack","sebastian.schornack@slcu.cam.ac.uk","25 June 2013","","","Understanding commonalities and differences of how symbiotic and parasitic microbes interact with plants will improve advantageous interactions and allow pathogen control strategies in crops. Recently established systems enable studies of root pathogenic and symbiotic interactions in the same plant species., Dual systems are crop plants whose roots are colonized by filamentous symbiotic microbes (for example, the widely used AM fungus Glomus irregularis) but in addition can also be infected by other biotrophic pathogens. The legume species Medicago
                truncatula and Lotus japonicus have served as genetic model plants for symbiosis research [4, 8] and a huge genetic resource has been established by the community, rendering these plants prime candidates for systems to study similarities and differences between symbiosis and pathogenicity. Another established monocot system for symbiosis research is rice [15]. It is surprising, however, that not many root pathogen infection systems with clearly distinguishable biotrophic stages exist for these plant species., In AM fungi colonized roots, the ideal microbial pathogen partner to compare with is a naturally root colonizing filamentous organism with a broad host range. Other than G. irregularis it should be cultivatable, transformable and efficiently traceable in living tissues - for example, by fluorescent proteins. Several filamentous microbes have been employed to unravel the mechanisms involved in root colonization (Table 1). Historically, most research has been carried out using Aphanomyces euteiches [16], Colletotrichum trifolii [17] and Verticillium species [18], and to a major extent using Magnaporthe oryzae [19]. Piriformospora indica colonization of roots and its growth-promoting effects have also been studied in the economically relevant barley [20], a monocot plant that also establishes interactions with AM fungi [21].Table 1

C. trifolii experiments have helped to extend the role of the DMI3 (DOESN'T MAKE INFECTIONS 3) calcium/calmodulin kinase, a classical symbiosis signaling element, from symbiotic to pathogenic interactions [17]. Infections with C. trifolii showed differential responses between plants that carried either a DMI3 wild-type or a mutated allele., While C. trifolii and M. oryzae were reported to establish biotrophic stages inside the root, others such as apoplast-colonizing A. euteiches [16] and Verticillium albo-atrum [18] lack the potential to form intracellular structures such as the arbuscular feeding structures of AM fungi, thereby complicating the delimitation of their biotrophic stages. Nevertheless, A. euteiches has been successfully employed to identify signaling elements that are shared between symbiotic and pathogen perception mechanisms. An example is NFP (NOD FACTOR PERCEPTION), a lysin motif receptor-like kinase (LysM-RLK) that is integral to perception of lipochitooligosaccharidic symbiosis factors from AM fungi by the plant. Recently, NFP was shown to also affect colonization by the pathogen A. euteiches [16]. Larger sets of LysM-RLK receptor variants can be found in root nodule and AM-forming legumes [23, 24] and non-nodulating but AM-forming rice [25] compared with non-mycorrhized and non-nodulated Arabidopsis. This enlarged receptor repertoire could correlate with a requirement for higher resolution signal discrimination between pathogens, mycorrhizal fungi and symbiotic bacteria. Further research is required to clarify how specificity in signal perception is achieved., A key element of beneficial AM fungi is nutrient exchange through tree-like arbuscules in the inner cortical cells of the host root (Figure 2) [9]. Thus, it is of particular interest to compare arbuscules with other morphologically distinguishable intracellular interfaces formed by pathogens in roots. M. oryzae and C. trifolii do form specialized intracellular hyphae and P. indica infrequently forms coils in root cells [26]. However, abundant haustoria of pathogenic fungi and oomycetes such as Phytophthora most strikingly resemble dedicated interfaces as observed in arbuscules [9]., Similar to the arbuscules of AM fungi, which are surrounded by a periarbuscular membrane spiked with an exclusively positioned phosphate transporter [27, 28], Phytophthora haustoria are enveloped by an extrahaustorial membrane with distinct features to normal plant plasma membranes [29]. We still do not fully understand why Phytophthora forms these intricate structures in plant cells. So far, haustoria are known to facilitate the deployment of pathogen-encoded effector proteins [30]. Currently, cellular research on Phytophthora haustoria is mainly focused on its interaction with above-ground plant parts [31]. However, the majority of Phytophthora species are prominent root pathogens [32], such as P. palmivora, which forms haustoria in roots and thus allows us to comparatively study arbuscules and haustoria in the same tissue (Figure 2). Indeed, the P. palmivora-M. truncatula system has recently helped to identify an overlap in the chemical language spoken between microbe and plant. A cutin-derived signal produced by M. truncatula roots was found to be required for the interaction of both beneficial AM fungi and pathogenic oomycetes [33]., 
                P. palmivora has a broad host range infecting numerous monocot and dicot cash crops such as oil palms, rubber trees, cocoa and coconut. As with other pathogens, its colonization potential resembles that of widespread AM fungi (Table 1). The broad host range of P. palmivora also enables it to infect the workhorse species of time-efficient plant cell biology and fast-forward genetics: Nicotiana benthamiana [34], a species that has also been studied in the context of AM fungal symbiosis [35] (Figure 2). Transformation of Phytophthora facilitates the generation of tracer lines and allows highlighting pathogen-formed haustoria components [31]. Transformability and also knowledge of the P. palmivora genome will enable us to functionally assess pathogen-encoded factors that contribute to colonization such as secreted effector proteins., Historically, microbe-encoded effector proteins with functionality inside the host were a hallmark of bona fide pathogens [36]. Cytoplasmic effectors enter the host cells and modify plant processes to suppress immunity and support pathogen colonization [7]. Notably, effectors that target plant root cell processes have recently also been reported from Laccaria bicolor and G. irregularis, which are both beneficial mycorrhizal fungi [12, 13]. Evidently, also in beneficial plant-microbe interactions the microbe needs to suppress plant immunity to establish an interaction and prove its usefulness to the plant. The growing repertoire of characterized effectors and availability of numerous pathogen genomes (Table 1) will provide inroads to study common and contrasting effector-targeted processes of mutualistic and parasitic interactions. Furthermore, effector functions have been studied mainly in leaves, but transformable filamentous microbes that colonize roots now give us the tools to study effector functions below ground, where principles might diverge from the known., The described systems (Table 1), which are based on dual plant infections utilizing AM fungi and pathogens, will allow us to challenge findings obtained previously in either pathogen or symbiosis research. This will give insights into the commonalities and differences of both types of interaction outcomes. Moreover, several biotrophic pathogens (M. oryzae, P. palmivora), endophytes (P. indica) and beneficial AM fungi (G. irregularis) are directly applicable on rice, barley and other dicot crops, thereby bypassing the step to transfer knowledge of mechanisms from model plants into application., Systems that form specialized intracellular structures will be integral in solving open questions on filamentous microbe interactions with plants. We need to elucidate how similar arbuscules and pathogen interfaces are [9], and whether they generally also serve as devices for nutrient uptake [37]. Knowledge on general and specific transport mechanisms between microbe and plant may be decisive for our ability to protect plants from pathogens while maintaining symbiosis., Common sets of regulated genes point to a large overlap in development processes during beneficial and detrimental interactions [19]; however, we still need to clarify whether observed structural features, such as the pre-penetration apparatus formed during root colonization by AM fungi [38] or the typical tree-like branching of AM fungal arbuscules, are defined by the microbe species or the plant, or both., Root-colonizing microbes are guided by chemical plant signals but we do not know the extent to which these signals overlap. For example, plant flavonoids act as attractants for mobile oomycete zoospores and beneficial nitrogen-fixing root bacteria, while symbiotic fungi but also parasitic Striga hermontica plants perceive strigolactones released by the plant [39, 40]. Whether some filamentous pathogens are consistently responsive to strigolactones remains to be clarified [41]., Furthermore, it is important to identify contrasting principles in effector-mediated reprogramming and immune suppression between symbiotic microbes and pathogens. This might enable us to engineer the host processes they target in order to direct the outcome of an interaction towards the beneficial side."

To overcome the complexities of the large, highly repetitive and hexaploid wheat genome, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium established a chromosome-based strategy that was validated by the construction of the physical map of chromosome 3B. Here, we present improved strategies for the construction of highly integrated and ordered wheat physical maps, using chromosome 1BL as a template, and illustrate their potential for evolutionary studies and map-based cloning., Using a combination of novel high throughput marker assays and an assembly program, we developed a high quality physical map representing 93% of wheat chromosome 1BL, anchored and ordered with 5,489 markers including 1,161 genes. Analysis of the gene space organization and evolution revealed that gene distribution and conservation along the chromosome results from the superimposition of the ancestral grass and recent wheat evolutionary patterns, leading to a peak of synteny in the central part of the chromosome arm and an increased density of non-collinear genes towards the telomere. With a density of about 11 markers per Mb, the 1BL physical map provides 916 markers, including 193 genes, for fine mapping the 40 QTLs mapped on this chromosome., Here, we demonstrate that high marker density physical maps can be developed in complex genomes such as wheat to accelerate map-based cloning, gain new insights into genome evolution, and provide a foundation for reference sequencing.","chromosome 1BL, evolution, gene space, grasses, hexaploid wheat, map-based cloning, physical mapping, sequencing, synteny","Cereals crops, such as rice, maize, sorghum and wheat, are major caloric sources for humans and farm animals. While reference genome sequencesare available and are already supporting crop improvement in a challenging environment [1]for rice [2], sorghum[3]and maize [4], wheat genomics and its applicationis lagging behind. The wheat genome has always been viewed as impossible to sequence because of the large amount of repetitive sequences (>80%) [5],gigantic size (17 gigabases (Gb)) and the level of ploidy of bread wheat (2n = 6x = 42). Even with the rapid developments in DNA sequencing technologies that enable the production of gigabases of sequence within a few days [6], the short read lengths offered by these techniques and the large amount of repeated sequences present in the wheat genome make de novo assembly of non-genic regions extremely difficult [7]. These difficulties can be circumvented by focusing only on the gene catalogue and ignoring the intergenic regions that mostly consist of transposable elements. However, this practice is not justified in light of the results of whole genome functional analyses such as the characterization of 1% of the human genome in the ENCODE project [8] and association studies performed in maize [9]that clearly indicate the importance of intergenic regions in the regulation of genome expression. Thus, a complete wheat genome sequence is needed to access the complete catalogue of genes and regulatory elements and to provide a framework for understanding the impact of genomic variation on phenotypes. While long read single molecule sequencing may in the future enable tacklingof large and complex genomes using only whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, the only feasible approach at this time to obtain a complete reference genome sequence of bread wheat is bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) by BAC sequencing based on the construction of robust physical maps., To reduce the complexity of physically mapping a 17 Gb hexaploid genome containing more than 80% similar or identical sequences, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) [10] has adopted a strategy based on the individual sorting and analysis of chromosome or chromosome arms by flow cytometry [11] to construct specific BAC libraries[12]. The first BAC library [13]was used successfully to establish a chromosome landing-ready physical map of chromosome 3B, the largest wheat chromosome (1 Gb) [14]. This physical map has been used in several studies to analyze the composition and organization of the wheat gene space, provide estimates of the gene number, and determine the relative proportion of transposable elements families in the wheat genome[5, 15, 16]. In contrast to early cytogenetic studies based on expressed sequence tag(EST) mapping suggesting that most of the genes are found in a few large, gene-rich regions[17],these analysesrevealed the presence of numerous small gene islands dispersed along the chromosome and no geneless region larger than 800 kilobases (kb). Moreover, access to physical maps and sequences helped to refine collinearityrelationships between wheat and the other grass genomesby providing a higher level of resolution than genetic or cytogenetic mapping[15, 16, 18].The strategy used to build the physical map of wheat chromosome 3B was based on a high-information-content fingerprinting method [19] and FingerPrinted Contigs (FPC) software[20, 21] for the assemblies. It resulted in 1,036 contigs with an N50 of 778 kb covering 82% of the chromosome[14]. To improve physical assembly in complex genomes, new software, called Linear Topological Contig (LTC),has been developed recently as an attractive alternative to FPC. It enables longer, better ordered and more robust contigs to be built compared to FPC contigs [22]. Physical maps are only useful when they are anchored to genetic maps and traits with markers. PCR methods used to anchor the physical map of chromosome 3B resulted in a marker density of 1.4 markers per megabase (Mb)and 56% of the physical map anchored. While useful for many map-based cloning projects, this marker density is far from that obtained in rice [23] or maize [24] (8 and 12 markers per Mb, respectively) and should be increased for breeding purposes. High throughput anchoring platforms [16]that increasethe number of genes anchored to the physical maps have been developed in wheat recently but more anchoring resources and efforts are still needed. In addition to anchoring the physical map with markers, it is important to order the physical contigs along the chromosomes. Here, the wheat genome is again a challenge because of the uneven distribution and lack of recombination in more than half of the chromosomes[25]., In this work, we used a combination ofnew high throughput genotyping assays and synteny with other grass genomes to establish a physical map of the wheat chromosome 1BL with the highest marker density for a wheat physical map so far (11 markers per Mb), a high level of anchoring (74% in the deletion bins; 19% on the genetic map) and a good percentage (48%) of contigs ordered along the chromosome arm. This physical map allowed us to gain new insights into chromosome evolution and refine estimates of physical sizes of deletion bins.Further, it provides a powerful tool for chromosome landing and for sequencing chromosome 1BL in the near future. The new high throughput marker assays combined with the optimized assembly and ordering methodologies proposed here can be applied to other plant genomes with similar levels of redundancy and complexity., Using a combination of efficient assembly tools and high throughput genotyping platforms, we developed a high quality physical map representing 94% of wheat chromosome 1BL. The map is anchored (74%) and ordered (48%) with 5,489 markers, representing the highest density of markers (11 markers per Mb) so far for a wheat physical map.This provides a powerful tool for map-based cloning and a robust platform for sequencing the 1BL chromosome in a BAC-by-BAC approach.The high density of genes mapped on the 1BL physical map allowed us to gain new insights into the gene space organization.Further, it revealedthat the pattern of synteny along chromosome 1BL is the result of the superimposition of the ancestral grass and recent wheat evolutionary patterns."

To solve this problem, we develop a specialized bioinformatics workflow that optimizes transcriptome assembly and separation of merged homoeologs. To evaluate our strategy, we sequence and assemble the transcriptome of one of the diploid ancestors of pasta wheat, and compare both assemblies with a benchmark set of 13,472 full-length, non-redundant bread wheat cDNAs., A total of 489 million 100 bp paired-end reads from tetraploid wheat assemble in 140,118 contigs, including 96% of the benchmark cDNAs. We used a comparative genomics approach to annotate 66,633 open reading frames. The multiple k-mer assembly strategy increases the proportion of cDNAs assembled full-length in a single contig by 22% relative to the best single k-mer size. Homoeologs are separated using a post-assembly pipeline that includes polymorphism identification, phasing of SNPs, read sorting, and re-assembly of phased reads. Using a reference set of genes, we determine that 98.7% of SNPs analyzed are correctly separated by phasing., Our study shows that de novo transcriptome assembly of tetraploid wheat benefit from multiple k-mer assembly strategies more than diploid wheat. Our results also demonstrate that phasing approaches originally designed for heterozygous diploid organisms can be used to separate the close homoeologous genomes of tetraploid wheat. The predicted tetraploid wheat proteome and gene models provide a valuable tool for the wheat research community and for those interested in comparative genomic studies.","Transcriptome assembly, multiple k-mer assembly, wheat, polyploid,

              , pseudogenes, phasing, gene prediction","Whole genome duplication events, or polyploidization, have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolutionary history of flowering plants[1, 2]. Many currently cultivated species are recent polyploids, formed through either inter-specific hybridization (allopolyploids, such as wheat, oats, canola, peanut, and cotton)or intra-specific hybridization (autopolyploids, such as apple, strawberry, watermelon, and alfalfa)[2]. In addition,homoeologs in older polyploid species, such as maize (11-15 million years since polyploidization)[3]have had a longer time to diverge through deletions, loss of function, neo-functionalization, and sub-functionalization processes (usually referred to as diploidization). These processes confer polyploid species an increased evolutionary plasticity, whichpromotes speciation and adaptation to new environmentsand contributes to the huge success of polyploidy in plant evolution[2, 4].When diploidization processes continue over long periods of time, they lead to the formation of paleo-polyploid species (for example, rice), which are difficult to differentiate from true diploid species. However, genomic studies haveprovided convincing evidence of ancient whole genome duplication events in the early monocot and dicot lineages suggesting that polyploidy was part of the evolution of most current angiosperms [5, 6]., Wheat (Triticum spp.) was domesticated at the dawn of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago and has since been adapted to grow in a broad range of climates throughout the world [4]. Most cultivated wheat varieties belong to two species; tetraploid Triticum turgidum L. (durum or pasta wheat, genomes AABB) and hexaploid T. aestivum L. (common wheat, genomes AABBDD). The tetraploid wheat genome originated from an inter-specific hybridization event occurring less than 0.5 million years ago, which combined the AA genome of T. urartu Tumanian ex Gandilyan and the BB genome of an unknown grass species related to Aegilops speltoides Tausch[7–9].Common wheat, T. aestivum , evolved from a second round of inter-specific hybridization and genome duplication that occurred shortly after domestication and combinedthe tetraploid AABB genomes of cultivated T. turgidum and the DD genome of the wild grass Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmalh[4]., The diploid progenitors of polyploid wheat species diverged from a common ancestor only 2.5-4.5 million years ago[10], which is reflected in a high average identity (approximately 97%) among coding regions of different wheat homoeologs. However, this average varies greatly among gene classes that are subject to different evolutionary pressures [11]. For example, conversion events (unequal crossing-over between tandemly-duplicated paralogs) and diversifying selection processes are known to accelerate the divergence rate between members of the disease resistance gene family [12–14]., Wheat intergenic regions diverge even faster than rapidly evolving gene families due to high levels of methylation and increased rates of insertions and deletions, which are associated with the abundance of repetitive elements in these regions [15]. These rapid changes in the intergenic regions can affect neighboring genes and result in rapid rates of gene insertion, deletion, and transposition[16].The potentially negative effects associated with gene deletions are buffered by polyploidy[17–20].Transposition of genes and gene fragments by adjacent retroelements results in higher proliferation of pseudogenes in the large polyploid Triticeae genomes compared to other grass species with smaller genomes[19, 21].In addition, increased divergence of alternative splicing variants between the diploid progenitors further diversifieshomoeologs'gene structure (and potentially their function) in the polyploid wheat species[21]. The dynamic nature of these large genomes needs to be considered in the development of strategies to characterize the wheat gene complement., In species with large genomes, de novo transcriptome assemblies are an effective strategy to access the gene spacewhile avoiding the highly repetitive intergenic regions. In wheat, for example, the transcribed gene-coding regionsrepresent only 1% to 2% percent of the totalgenome[22]. Rapid growth in throughput, quality, and accessibility of next-generation sequencing technologies, together with improvements in de novo transcriptome assembly algorithms have fostered a multitude of transcriptome sequencing projects. With increased access to next generation sequencing, many plant de novo transcriptome assemblies have been published and several different assembly algorithms have been proposed[23–25]. However, the challenges specific to de novo transcriptome assembly of a young polyploid speciessuch as tetraploid wheat are just starting to be addressed[26, 27]. Particularly important is the correct separation of close homoeologs, since there are known examples of different homoeologs contributing differently to important agronomic traits (for example, wheat VRN1 homoeologs[28]). Correct separation of homoeologs is also important for breeding applications, marker development, and downstream genomics analyses., Three recent studiesof hexaploid wheat transcriptomes[27, 29, 30] highlight the difficulties of assembling closely related homoeologs in a polyploid species. Schreiber et al. (2012) observed that most homoeologs were collapsed into chimeric contigs when hexaploid wheat transcriptomes were assembled using either Velvet/Oases (60% to 80% chimeric sequences) or Trinity (50% chimeric sequences). A computationally-intensive two-stage assembly using the MIRA assembler helped to reduce the number of chimeric homoeolog sequences to 18%, thus partially solving the polyploid problem at the assembly step [27].An alternative strategy was used by The International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC): genome-specific contigs of hexaploid wheatwere generated by sorting individual chromosome arms usingflow cytometry and sequencing and assembling each of them separately[21, 31, 32]., In this paper, we present abioinformatics pipeline that addresses the challenges of de novo transcriptome assembly of the closely related genomes of tetraploid wheat. Using this pipeline, weassembled, annotated and analyzedthe transcriptome of T. turgidum cv. Kronos and of its closest diploid relative T. urartu.This diploid wheat transcriptome together with a reference dataset of 13,472 full-lengthwheat cDNAs were used to evaluate the effect of different parameters on the quality of the tetraploid wheat assembly.We developed post-assembly processing strategies and software that allowed us to generate homoeolog-specific sub-assemblies. Finally, we used comparative genomics approaches to annotate open reading frames and predicted proteins, predict pseudogenes and artificially fused transcripts, and generate gene models to increase the value of this resource., The data from this study is linked to the BioProject PRJNA191053 established for T. urartu and Bioproject PRJNA191054 for T. turgidum.

High-throughput technologies are revealing interactions between these complex communities and their hosts in unprecedented detail., Microbes are fundamental to the maintenance of life on Earth, yet we understand little about the majority of microbes in environments such as soils, oceans, the atmosphere and even those living on and in our own bodies. Culture-based techniques have allowed isolated microbes to be studied in detail, and molecular techniques such as metagenomics are increasingly allowing the identification of microbes in situ. The microbial communities, or microbiomes, of diverse environments have been studied in this way, with the goal of understanding their ecological function [1, 2]., The plant microbiome is a key determinant of plant health and productivity [3] and has received substantial attention in recent years [4, 5]. A testament to the importance of plant-microbe interactions are the mycorrhizal fungi. Molecular evidence suggests that their associations with green algae were fundamental to the evolution of land plants about 700 million years ago [6]. Most plants, although notably not Arabidopsis thaliana and other Brassicaceae, have maintained this symbiosis, which assists root uptake of mineral nutrients such as phosphate [7]. Plant-associated microbes are also key players in global biogeochemical cycles [8]. A significant amount, 5 to 20%, of the products of photosynthesis (the photosynthate) is released, mainly into the rhizosphere (the soil-root interface) through roots [9]. In addition, 100 Tg of methanol and 500 Tg of isoprene are released into the atmosphere by plants annually [10, 11]. For methanol this corresponds to between 0.016% and 0.14% of photosynthate depending on plant type [10]. Both are potential sources of carbon and energy for microorganisms. In agricultural soils in particular, plants stimulate microbial denitrification and methanogenesis, which contribute to emissions of N2O and methane, respectively [12, 13]. These gases represent a loss of carbon and nitrogen from the system and contribute to the greenhouse effect., Manipulation of the plant microbiome has the potential to reduce the incidence of plant disease [14, 15], increase agricultural production [16], reduce chemical inputs [17] and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases [18], resulting in more sustainable agricultural practices. This goal is seen as vital for sustaining the world's growing population., Virtually all tissues of a plant host a microbial community. Here, we focus on the rhizosphere, phyllosphere (plant aerial surfaces) and endosphere (internal tissues). The rhizosphere is a region of rich, largely soil-derived, microbial diversity, influenced by deposition of plant mucilage and root exudates [19]. By contrast, the phyllosphere is relatively nutrient poor and subject to extremes of temperature, radiation and moisture [20]. Microbial inhabitants of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere (those near or on plant tissue) are considered epiphytes, whereas microbes residing within plant tissues (the endosphere), whether in leaves, roots or stems, are considered endophytes. Microbes in these niches can establish beneficial, neutral or detrimental associations of varying intimacy with their host plants. Specific interactions between microbes and model plants, such as in Rhizobium-legume symbioses [21], are well understood, but the majority of the plant microbiome, and its contribution to the extended phenotype of the host, is not yet well defined. Importantly, the microbiome is strongly influenced by the plant genome and may be considered as an extension to form a second genome or collectively to form a pan-genome., Classic microbiology involves isolating and culturing microbes from an environment using different nutrient media and growth conditions depending on the target organisms. Although obtaining a pure culture of an organism is required for detailed studies of its genetics and physiology, culture-dependent techniques miss the vast majority of microbial diversity in an environment. Numerous culture-independent, molecular techniques are used in microbial ecology. For studying prokaryotes, PCR amplification of the ubiquitous 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is commonly used. Sequencing the variable regions of this gene allows precise (species- and strain-level) taxonomic identification. The use of high-throughput sequencing technologies [22, 23] has been widely adopted as they allow identification of thousands to millions of sequences in a sample, revealing the abundances of even rare microbial species. For studying eukaryotic microbes such as fungi, the equivalent rRNA gene (18S) may not provide sufficient taxonomic discrimination so the hypervariable internally transcribed spacer is often used., A limitation of this is that PCR amplification of genomic DNA is inherently biased by primer design [24, 25] and generally only identifies the target organisms. Complex environments are inhabited by organisms from all domains of life. Eukaryotes, including fungi, protozoa, oomycetes and nematodes, are ubiquitous in soils and can be important plant pathogens or symbionts, whereas others are bacterial grazers. The archaea carry out important biochemical reactions, particularly in agricultural soils, such as ammonia oxidation [26] and methanogenesis [13]. Viruses too are abundant and widespread and can affect the metabolism and population dynamics of their hosts [27]. Microbes in a community interact with each other and the host plant [28], so it is important to capture as much of the diversity of a microbiome as possible. To do so requires the use of global analyses such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics, which allow simultaneous assessment and comparison of microbial populations across all domains of life. Metagenomics can reveal the functional potential of a microbiome (the abundance of genes involved in particular metabolic processes), whereas metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics provide snapshots of community-wide gene expression and protein abundance, respectively., Metatranscriptomics has revealed kingdom-level changes in the structure of crop-plant rhizosphere microbiomes [29]. The relative abundance of eukaryotes in pea and oat rhizospheres was five-fold higher than in plant-free soil or the rhizosphere of modern hexaploid wheat. The pea rhizosphere in particular was highly enriched with fungi. Additional molecular techniques can complement such approaches. For example, stable isotope probing allows organisms metabolizing a particular labeled substrate to be identified [30]. This has been used in studies of rhizosphere microbiomes where 13CO2 was fed to plants and fixed by photosynthesis, revealing that a subset of the microbial community actively metabolized plant-derived carbon [31, 32]. Combining these techniques with culture-based approaches should improve our understanding of plant-microbe interactions at the systems level., The rhizosphere is the region of soil influenced by plant roots through rhizodeposition of exudates, mucilage and sloughed cells. Root exudates contain a variety of compounds, predominately organic acids and sugars, but also amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, growth factors, hormones and antimicrobial compounds [33]. Root exudates are key determinants of rhizosphere microbiome structure [34–37]. The composition of root exudates can vary between plant species and cultivars [38, 39], and with plant age and developmental stage [40–42]. Also, the microbiome influences root exudates, as axenically grown (sterile) plants have markedly different exudate compositions from those influenced by microbes. Some accessions of A. thaliana have been shown to have different root exudate compositions and correspondingly different rhizosphere bacterial communities [38], whereas the rhizosphere bacterial communities of other accessions have shown high similarity [43, 44], although root exudates were not analyzed in the latter two studies., Root exudates are not the only component of rhizodeposition. The sloughing of root cells and the release of mucilage deposits a large amount of material into the rhizosphere, including plant cell wall polymers such as cellulose and pectin [45]. Cellulose degradation is widespread among microbial residents of high-organic-matter soils [46, 47]. The decomposition of pectin releases methanol [10], which can be used as a carbon source by other microbes, and active metabolism of methanol in the rhizosphere has been observed [48]. As well as providing a carbon source to rhizosphere microbes, plant roots also provide a structure on which microbes can attach. Supporting this is the observation of significant overlap between bacteria attaching to a root and to an inert wooden structure [44]., Studies of rhizosphere microbiomes have revealed remarkably similar distributions of microbial phyla [29, 43, 44]. Differences between plant cultivars become apparent when comparing microbial species and strains [49, 50]. The Proteobacteria usually dominate samples, particularly those of the α and β classes. Other major groups include Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria., Of particular interest in the rhizosphere are plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria, which act through a variety of mechanisms [14]. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including those that are free-living (such as Azotobacter spp.) and symbiotic (such as root-nodulating Rhizobium spp.), provide a source of fixed nitrogen for the plant, and many bacteria can solubilize phosphorous-containing minerals, increasing its bioavailability. Microbial manipulation of plant hormones, particularly auxins, gibberellins and ethylene, can also lead to growth promotion or stress tolerance. Many plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria act antagonistically towards plant pathogens by producing antimicrobials or by interfering with virulence factors via effectors delivered by type 3 secretion systems (T3SSs) [51]. Actinomycetes, in particular, are known to produce a wide array of compounds with antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, nematicidal and insecticidal properties. They are often found as one of the most abundant bacterial classes in soil and rhizospheres, and are notably enriched in endophytic communities., Other bacteria also act as disease antagonists, including Pseudomonas fluorescens, which produces the antifungal compound diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). Pseudomonas spp. producing DAPG have also been shown to modulate transcription in another plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium, Azospirillum brasilense, increasing expression of genes involved in wheat root colonization and plant-growth promotion [52]. DAPG also affects other microbiota, including nematodes, where it was found to be toxic to some species but stimulatory to others [53]. The presence of DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. in soils has been implicated in the phenomenon of take-all decline. Take-all is a cereal disease caused by the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis. In take-all decline, disease severity reduces with repeated cultivation of a plant such as wheat. The soil becomes disease suppressive as a result of the establishment of antagonistic microbial communities [54]. Other antagonists from the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria contributed to soils suppressive towards the root-rotting fungus Rhizoctonia [55]; antifungal-metabolite-producing pseudomonads were one of the main groups responsible for suppression. Shifts in microbiomes have also been associated with soils suppressive towards Fusarium [56] and Streptomyces scabies [57]. This suggests that a consortium of microbes contributes to suppressiveness, although cause and effect are often not distinguishable. A rich and diverse microbiota alone may be sufficient to prevent infection by limiting access to roots and nutrients., The phyllosphere, or aerial surface of a plant, is considered relatively nutrient poor compared with the rhizosphere. Microbial colonization of leaves is not homogenous but is affected by leaf structures such as veins, hairs and stomata. Leaf surfaces are colonized by up to 107 microbes per cm2 [58]. The phyllosphere is a much more dynamic environment than the rhizosphere, with resident microbes subjected to large fluxes in temperature, moisture and radiation throughout the day and night. These abiotic factors also indirectly affect the phyllosphere microbiome through changes in plant metabolism. Precipitation and wind in particular are thought to contribute to the temporal variability in resident phyllosphere microbes [59]. Interestingly, leaf metabolite profiles of A. thaliana have been altered by application of soil microbes to roots: increased concentration of several amino acids in the leaf metabolome was correlated with increased herbivory by insects [60], suggesting cross-talk between above- and below-ground parts of the plant., Bacterial and fungal communities in the phyllospheres of various plants have been profiled using PCR amplification of rRNA genes. Microbial richness seems to be greater in warmer, more humid climates than in temperate ones. Proteobacteria (the α and γ classes) are consistently the dominant bacterial phylum, with Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria also commonly found [20, 61]. The phyllospheres of several plants in the Mediterranean were found to be dominated by lactic acid bacteria (Firmicutes) during summer. Their mode of metabolism was proposed to allow them to tolerate the hot and dry weather conditions [62], although this was not compared between different seasons. At high microbial taxonomic levels, phyllosphere microbiomes of different plants can seem similar, but at the microbial species and strain levels stark differences are apparent, reflecting the finely tuned metabolic adaptations required to live in such an environment [20]. Although rhizosphere microbiomes are comparable to soil, little similarity has been found between phyllosphere microbiomes and those of air [62]., Proteogenomic analyses of various phyllosphere microbiomes have revealed species that assimilate plant-derived ammonium, amino acids and simple carbohydrates, implicating these compounds as primary nitrogen and carbon sources in the phyllosphere. Expression of microbial stress response proteins, porins, components of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters and TonB-dependent receptors, particularly those from Sphingomonas spp., was high [48, 63], indicating a nutrient-poor environment. These studies [48, 63] also determined that Methylobacterium spp. and other methylotrophs were widely abundant phyllosphere microbes, and that they were actively assimilating and metabolizing methanol derived from plant pectin [10]. Metagenomic analysis of taxonomically diverse plant species has identified an abundance of various known and novel microbial rhodopsins present in the phyllosphere. These light-sensing proteins and proton pumps showed non-overlapping absorption spectra with their host plant [64], showing that energy metabolism in the phyllosphere is not entirely dependent on the plant., Endophytic bacteria are those that reside for at least part of their lives within plant tissues [65–68]. They are generally considered to be non-pathogenic, causing no visible symptoms, but they include latent pathogens that, depending on environmental circumstances and/or host genotype, can cause disease [67, 69]. Endophytes are thought to be a sub-population of the rhizosphere microbiome [66], but they also have characteristics distinct from rhizospheric bacteria, suggesting that not all rhizospheric bacteria can enter plants, and/or that once inside their hosts they change their metabolism and become adapted to their internal environment [67, 68, 70]. Although it is generally assumed that the bacteria that can be isolated from plant tissues after surface sterilization are 'endophytic', this may not be the case, as there are numerous niches on the surfaces of roots and aerial parts where bacteria can remain protected from the chemicals typically used for surface sterilization, and so confirmation that particular bacteria are truly endophytic must come from high-quality light microscopy (for example confocal) and/or transmission electron microscopy of fixed and resin-embedded samples [66, 67, 71] (Figure 1). In two of the most recent studies, sonication was used to remove surface layers of plant tissue and the remaining tissue used to define the endophyte microbiome [43, 44]. Such studies revealed that endophytic bacteria mostly reside in the intercellular apoplast and in dead or dying cells (Figure 1a-d), and as yet they have not been convincingly shown to occupy living cells in the same organized manner as true endosymbioses, such as that between legumes and rhizobia. They are also often found in the xylem vessels (Figure 1e,f), within which they may be translocated from the roots to the aerial parts.

                    , But how do these bacteria initially enter their hosts? The best evidence suggests that they enter at lateral root junctions, most likely at naturally occurring cracks (Figure 1a,b) [67, 69, 72, 73]. However, it should be stressed that this is unlikely to be an entirely passive process, as many endophytic bacteria express cell-wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), albeit generally in lower concentrations than expressed by plant pathogens [67]. Also, a few (for example, some Herbaspirillum spp. [67]) have been shown to possess T3SSs, which are the route of exit for excreted plant CWDEs, although most do not [68]., Other, more passive modes of entry are often through natural breaks in roots or root tips (Figure 1d) and/or by vegetative propagation; for example, stem seed pieces (pieces of cut sugarcane stem that contain at least one viable node from which a new plant can sprout) are a major source of the endophytic diazotroph population that colonizes the emerging sugarcane stalk and roots [69]. Once inside the roots, the bacteria colonize the apoplast, but their numbers seem to be controlled, as they rarely exceed 107 to 108 colony forming units (cfu) per gram fresh weight, and are often as low as 103 cfu per gram fresh weight, depending on plant age and genotype. Younger plants have higher bacterial concentrations than mature ones, and the concentrations of epiphytic bacteria are usually greater than those of endophytes, such as by a factor of ten in the case of Herbaspirillum [72]. To put these endophyte numbers into perspective, symbiotically effective legume nodules typically contain up to 1011 cfu rhizobial bacteroids per gram fresh weight [74], so it would seem that the numbers of endophytic bacteria are not so high as to require the development of a specialized organ, such as a nodule, to house them. Indeed, high concentrations of endophytic bacteria (for example, over 108 cfu per gram fresh weight) can result in the elicitation of a host defense response [66, 72] (Figure 1f). In addition, endophyte numbers are generally lower in aerial parts than in roots [67], which suggests that although there is some upward movement of endophytes within their hosts, perhaps through the transpiration stream, this movement is limited, and may only be possible for bacteria that express CWDEs and/or the T3SS [66, 67, 72]., Most of our knowledge about endophytic bacteria comes from work on a few well studied 'model' organisms, such as Azoarcus, Burkholderia, Gluconacetobacter, Herbaspirillum and Klebsiella spp., which were all isolated from non-legumes, particularly grasses [66, 67, 69, 73, 75]. Although these studies have given much insight into mechanisms of infection and colonization, they tell us little about the true diversity of the bacteria in the endophytic microbiome, and, indeed, they may not be particularly representative of it. Culture-independent methods, such as analyses of 16S rRNA and nifH transcripts [76], and metagenome analyses [68] have demonstrated a huge diversity of endophytes in the economically important crops sugarcane and rice. Interestingly, these studies suggest that rhizobia (and other α-Proteobacteria) are very common endophytes, as are β-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria and Firmicutes., High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA has recently been used to define the core endophytic bacterial microbiome of A. thaliana [43, 44]. These studies showed that although various different soil types altered the bacterial endophyte microbiome, Actinobacteria and some families from the Proteobacteria were consistently enriched in the endosphere compared with the rhizosphere. The endophyte microbiomes seemed to be a subset of the rhizosphere microbiomes, indicating much stronger plant selection for the internal environment. This raises the important question of the role of plant immunity. Does innate immunity through the recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) have a role in selection of microbes?, On the plant side, the best studied systems have been those involving the inoculation of sugarcane and rice by defined strains of endophytic and/or rhizospheric bacteria, particularly Azospirillum, Burkholderia, Gluconacetobacter and Herbaspirillum spp. [77–80]. This subject has been reviewed recently [67]. The most important genomic response that has been reported in rice or sugarcane after inoculation with endophytic bacteria is modulation of the expression of plant defense-related genes, such as resistance (R) genes and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing-receptor-like kinases; these are expressed at different levels (higher or lower) than typically occurs when the plants are challenged with phytopathogens without any endophytic bacteria. For example, when the sugarcane variety B4362, which is susceptible to mottled stripe disease, was inoculated with the causal organism, Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans [67], expression of the LRR-rich receptor-like kinase SHR5 was unaltered, whereas it decreased significantly in non-susceptible varieties and when the same variety was challenged with Herbaspirillum seropedicae, a non-phytopathogenic endophytic relative of H. rubrisubalbicans [80]. Moreover, the ethylene receptors in sugarcane and rice are differentially expressed in response to endophytic bacteria; some, but not all, are upregulated, and the type of ethylene receptor that is expressed depends on which endophytic bacterial species is inoculated onto the plant [77, 78]. In contrast, when sugarcane is challenged with phytopathogens such as Leifsonia xyli and sugarcane mosaic virus, ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) that are repressed after inoculation with endophytic bacteria (such as SCERF1) are strongly upregulated [78]. Taken together, these genomic responses suggest that the plants are 'prepared' for their invasion by these 'friendly' bacteria in a manner that is very different to their reactions to phytopathogens., Interestingly, many of these defense genes are also differentially expressed depending on the host and the bacterial genotype. The facts that they are so commonly isolated from almost all types of multicellular plants, and that there are specific plant genomic responses to them that are different from the responses of other types of plant-associated bacteria (such as phytopathogens) suggest that endophytic bacteria are at least tolerated by their hosts and may actually be welcomed by them. So what are the potential benefits (if any) to plants of endophytic bacteria? There have been many studies on 'endophytic diazotrophs' (nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in plants, particularly in grasses), and there is evidence that these can express nif genes and proteins (which are involved in nitrogen fixation), and that they may even fix significant amounts of nitrogen and transfer it to their hosts [71–73]. There has also been much recent focus on endophytic bacteria that have plant-growth-promoting characteristics, such as hormone production (indoles, auxins), phosphate-solubilization, siderophores and 1-aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase [66, 68, 75]. It has been shown by some studies (for example, of sugarcane) that some endophytic bacteria are more likely to possess all or some of these plant-growth-promoting characteristics than epiphytic or rhizospheric bacteria on the same hosts [70]. In addition, it is known that plants that have been inoculated with endophytic bacteria, such as G. diazotrophicus and Herbaspirillum, may be better protected against phytopathogenic fungi and/or bacteria through systemically acquired resistance [67]., We know that inoculation with specific strains (either singly or in consortia) of endophytic bacteria that have plant-growth-promoting characteristics and/or diazotrophy can result in significant growth benefits to host plants; however, if we are to exploit the full potential of endophytic bacteria the challenge now is to determine several things about them and their hosts. First, we need to know whether these well studied strains and species are 'representative' of the endophytic bacterial populations that seem to naturally pertain in all higher plants. Second, we need to know whether endophytic bacteria are essential for the health of their hosts, and if so, whether it is possible to compare naturally 'bacterized' plants to those without any endophytic bacterial population. And third, we need to find out how we can exploit knowledge about the genomes of the host plants, particularly those of economically important crops, and how they respond to specific endophytic bacteria and/or to endophytic bacteria in general; in other words, whether we can carefully 'match' host and bacterial genotypes with the aim of optimizing their association in terms of crop productivity., The interactions between a plant and its microbiome are highly complex and dynamic. The plant immune system (Box 1) in particular is thought to have a key role in determining plant microbiome structure. Mutants of A. thaliana deficient in systemic acquired resistance (SAR) have shown differences in rhizosphere bacterial community composition compared with wild type [81], whereas chemical activation of SAR did not result in significant shifts in the rhizosphere bacterial community [82]. In the phyllosphere of A. thaliana, induction of salicylic-acid-mediated defense reduced the diversity of endophytes, whereas plants deficient in jasmonate-mediated defense showed higher epiphytic diversity [83]. These reports suggest that the effects of plant defense processes on the microbiome are variable and that SAR is responsible for controlling the populations of some bacteria., Production of plant hormones such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is widespread among plant-associated bacteria, particularly the rhizobia [84], and some Bacillus spp. can produce gibberellins [85]. Pseudomonas syringae produces hormone analogs that interfere with jasmonate and ethylene signaling, resulting in stomatal opening and pathogen entry [86]. Degradation of hormones or hormone precursors by bacteria is also documented. For example, microbial deamination of ACC prevents plant ethylene signaling, resulting in plants more tolerant to environmental stress [87]., Although some chemical signals released by plants facilitate specific interactions, many are recognized by other organisms. For example, flavonoids trigger diverse responses in rhizobia, mycorrhiza, root pathogens and other plants [88]. Strigolactones induce hyphal branching in mycorrhizal fungi and promote seed germination of parasitic plants [89]. Some plant genes and pathways have roles in establishment of multiple interactions with different microbes; examples include the developmental pathways that are shared between mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbioses [90], the mycorrhizal symbiosis and infection by oomycetes [91] and the rhizobial symbiosis and infection by nematodes [92]. It is not yet known whether and how these pathways interact with other members of the microbiome., Plants produce a wide variety of antimicrobial compounds both constitutively and in response to pathogens [93]. Phenolics, terpenoids and alkaloids are widespread in the plant kingdom, whereas others are restricted to particular groups [94]; glucosinolates, for example, are produced only by members of the order Brassicales. Arabidopsis produces glucosinolates naturally, but transgenic Arabidopsis producing an exogenous glucosinolate altered the bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and root tissue [95]. Oat (Avena strigosa) produces triterpenoid saponins known as avenacins, which have broad-spectrum antifungal activity [96]. Oat mutants lacking avenacins have different culturable communities of root-colonizing fungi [97] and are more susceptible to fungal pathogens than isogenic wild-type oat [98, 99]. Surprisingly, however, a recent global analysis of the rhizosphere microbiome of these two genotypes found little difference between the fungal communities. The eukaryotic Amoebozoa and Alveolata were strongly affected by the lack of avenacins in the mutant, whereas bacterial communities were unaffected [29]. This highlights that a small change in plant genotype can have complex and unforeseen effects on the plant microbiome. Other studies have not found any significant differences in rhizosphere microbiomes between wild-type maize and maize genetically engineered to produce Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin [100, 101], although this may be due to Bt toxin being insecticidal rather than antibacterial. Also, in the wheat rhizosphere, introduction of the pm3b gene conferring resistance to mildew had minimal effect on pseudomonads and mycorrhizal fungi populations [102]. Disease resistance, including production of antimicrobial compounds, is a trait likely to be introduced as a result of molecular breeding or genetic modification in attempts to control diseases. These may or may not affect resident members of the microbiome, potentially with unforeseen effects on the plant, and should be assessed on an individual basis. This is particularly important given that the products of disease resistance genes are often unknown., The microbiome can be considered as an extension of the host genome. Microbiomes associated with above-ground (phyllosphere), below-ground (rhizosphere) and internal (endosphere) tissues of the same plant are distinct. Also, microbiomes occupying the same niche of different plants can be very different, particularly when the microbiome is viewed at fine taxonomic levels such as genus, species and strain. This is where specific metabolic capabilities are required to use host-derived carbon sources and tolerate host defenses. Abiotic conditions, such as temperature, moisture and pH, have broad affects on the microbiome directly and indirectly through the host. Phyllosphere microbial communities are subject to huge fluxes in abiotic conditions, and so rates of microbial turnover are different between different regions of the plant. In addition, there is cross-talk between above- and below-ground plant tissues, which can affect other external factors such as herbivory. Even small changes in the host genome can influence the plant microbiome, and these changes can feed back to modulate the behavior of the host., Despite its complexity and dynamism, particularly in natural environments, it is important not to overlook the plant microbiome when interpreting experimental data, especially when it can lead to applications in the field. Genetic modification of plants, to resist disease for example, may have unforeseen consequences for the rest of the microbiome, which may or may not be physiologically relevant. The role of the microbiome and its relationship to plant health, productivity and biogeochemical cycles should be considered as much as the plant itself. An extension of this notion is that molecular breeding or genetic modification of plants could be used to modulate the microbiome intentionally, recruiting disease antagonists and plant-growth promoters to improve agricultural production., Plant innate immunity is triggered by exposure to microbes through microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) [103]. Because many of these responses were first investigated in pathogenic microbes, they are also know as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the plant response is called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). MAMPS are widespread, slowly evolving features of bacteria and other microbes, such as flagellin, elongation factor Tu and chitin. The plant response includes production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition (strengthening of cell walls) and activation of signaling and defense genes. Pathogens can affect these responses through secretion of effectors [104], which trigger a further response from the plant, known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [105]. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR), or priming, is activated by MAMP recognition and ETI. It is a plant-wide response involving the accumulation of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in healthy tissue, limiting the spread of the infection. Plant defense signaling is coordinated by hormones depending on the type of pathogen [106]. Salicylic acid is produced in response to attack by biotrophic pathogens, whereas jasmonate controls responses to insect herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens. Ethylene is another plant hormone produced in response to herbivores, necrotrophic pathogens, and environmental and developmental signals. It can also modulate the jasmonate and salicylic acid signaling pathways. Plant immunity has co-evolved with the plant microbiome and thus is thought to have a key role in determining its structure."

              Phytophthora capsici-tomato interaction features dramatic shifts in gene expression associated with a hemi-biotrophic lifestyle","Julietta Jupe, Remco Stam, Andrew JM Howden, Jenny A Morris, Runxuan Zhang, Pete E Hedley, Edgar Huitema","Division of Plant Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee Effector Consortium, James Hutton Institute, Invergowrie, Cell and Molecular Sciences, James Hutton Institute, Invergowrie, Information and Computational Sciences, James Hutton Institute, Invergowrie","Pete E Hedley, Edgar Huitema","Pete.Hedley@hutton.ac.uk, e.huitema@dundee.ac.uk","25 June 2013","Plant-microbe interactions feature complex signal interplay between pathogens and their hosts. Phytophthora species comprise a destructive group of fungus-like plant pathogens, collectively affecting a wide range of plants important to agriculture and natural ecosystems. Despite the availability of genome sequences of both hosts and microbes, little is known about the signal interplay between them during infection. In particular, accurate descriptions of coordinate relationships between host and microbe transcriptional programs are lacking., Here, we explore the molecular interaction between the hemi-biotrophic broad host range pathogen Phytophthora capsici and tomato. Infection assays and use of a composite microarray allowed us to unveil distinct changes in both P. capsici and tomato transcriptomes, associated with biotrophy and the subsequent switch to necrotrophy. These included two distinct transcriptional changes associated with early infection and the biotrophy to necrotrophy transition that may contribute to infection and completion of the P. capsici lifecycle, Our results suggest dynamic but highly regulated transcriptional programming in both host and pathogen that underpin P. capsici disease and hemi-biotrophy. Dynamic expression changes of both effector-coding genes and host factors involved in immunity, suggests modulation of host immune signaling by both host and pathogen. With new unprecedented detail on transcriptional reprogramming, we can now explore the coordinate relationships that drive host-microbe interactions and the basic processes that underpin pathogen lifestyles. Deliberate alteration of lifestyle-associated transcriptional changes may allow prevention or perhaps disruption of hemi-biotrophic disease cycles and limit damage caused by epidemics.","","Plant-pathogen interactions exhibit a dynamic interplay between host defense mechanisms and specialized pathogen structures that aim to subvert immunity. Although plants lack an adaptive immune system, they carry pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbe or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs) and initiate effective defense responses. This form of innate immunity, termed PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), ensures an early response to a broad range of potential pathogens, and generates systemic signals that travel to healthy tissues and prime defense signaling networks [1]. To counter plant defenses, pathogens deploy repertoires of secreted molecules (effectors) that, upon delivery into the host apoplast (extracellular effectors) or cell cytoplasm (intracellular effectors), modify cellular targets to suppress PTI and enable parasitic infection and reproduction [2–4]. In addition, pathogens may also secrete classes of effectors that provoke execution of host cellular processes required for disease development. Consequently, both host and microbe tightly control transcriptional programs that drive responses to external signals., 
                Phytophthora species are a destructive group of filamentous plant pathogens, which have a global distribution and devastating effect on a wide range of plants important to agriculture and natural ecosystems [5]. For example, Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight in potato and tomato crops, and Phytophthora capsici, an important pathogen of tomato, other solanaceous, and cucurbit plants, cause multi-billion dollar losses in crop production annually [6, 7]. The economic impact of this group of pathogens remains the principal driving force behind the need to understand Phytophthora parasitism and epidemics. Phytophthora spp. are hemi-biotrophic pathogens, having a lifestyle that features a biotrophic phase, followed by a switch to necrotrophy [8–10]. This lifestyle is also common to other detrimental filamentous plant pathogens such as fungi that fall into Magnaporthe, Colletotrichum, and Mycosphaerella genera [11]. In the early biotrophic phase, specialized infection structures, termed haustoria, are formed to breach the plant cell walls and interface with the host membrane [12, 13]. The initial biotrophic phase is crucial for infection and disease establishment, after which rapid intercellular growth and colonization occurs, ultimately leading to host cell death, sporulation, and initiation of a new infection cycle. Despite the availability of multiple Phytophthora genome sequences [7, 14, 15], little is known about the signal interplay between organisms that occurs during infection, or which processes in the plant contribute to the Phytophthora hemi-biotrophic lifestyle., Throughout the infection cycle, Phytophthora secretes effectors into its host with the aim to promote pathogen growth and reproduction [16–18]. The Phytophthora effector repertoire consists of extracellular proteins (apoplastic effectors) that inhibit or counter defense-associated compounds and lytic enzymes, as well as classes of secreted proteins that traverse the host membrane and target intracellular processes (intracellular effectors) [19]. Of the intracellular effectors, the RXLRs, named after their RXLR-dEER amino acid motif, translocate across the haustorial host-pathogen interface, where they are thought to perturb host cellular signaling and suppress immunity [13, 20, 21]. Besides the RXLRs, Phytophthora genomes encode another large class of intracellular effectors, termed crinklers (CRN), which feature a conserved LFLAK motif that is required for effector translocation. These effectors exclusively target the host nucleus upon delivery [14, 22, 23]., Owing to the tremendous economic impact Phytophthora-host associations have on crop production, it is crucial to understand how this group of pathogens manipulates their host and promote damage. Current breeding strategies rely on introgression of resistance genes and identifying new R-gene variants [24–26], which are often rapidly overcome by the pathogen [27–29]. Therefore, increasing interest lies in the mechanisms underpinning infection, disease establishment, and epidemics. One strategy for studying these processes is to examine host and pathogen gene-expression patterns during the course of infection. This will enable the identification of essential transcriptional changes that occur in the pathogen during infection, its establishment, and the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy. Equally important for understanding disease is identification of those host processes and signaling pathways that are perturbed by the pathogen while it progresses through its specific life stages., In the current study, we explored the association between the broad host range pathogen Phytophthora capsici and tomato. Infection time-course assays reveal a distinct hemi-biotrophic infection cycle, featuring haustoria formation early in, infection, followed by necrotrophy in the late disease stages. We exploited the availability of genome sequences for P. capsici and tomato to measure gene-expression changes in both P. capsici and tomato simultaneously during the course of infection. Microarray analyses, using a custom-designed combined pathogen and host whole-genome array helped define transcriptional changes in Phytophthora that were linked to (disease) development, and identified distinct transcriptional responses in tomato, associated with pathogen lifestyle. These unveil a requirement for Phytophthora to have enhanced protein production and metabolism in biotrophy, catabolism during its transition to necrotrophy, and induction of signaling and developmental processes upon sporulation. P. capsici infection of tomato results in two dramatic changes in the host transcriptome, favoring defense signaling and metabolism early after infection, whereas during the transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy, genes required for (a)biotic stress, signaling, and regulation are activated. We hypothesize that these changes are driven by differentially regulated and stage-specific effector genes identified in our study., Our results provide unique detail about the coordinated transcriptional reprogramming in both host and pathogen during infection, and lay a foundation for future studies on transcriptional programs that drive parasitic lifestyles. This work opens the door towards comparative transcriptomics studies that should help unravel pathogen infection strategies and exploit host basal defense responses., Our results suggest dynamic but highly regulated transcriptional programming in both host and pathogen that underpin P. capsici disease and hemi-biotrophy. We found expression changes in both effector-coding genes and host factors involved in immunity, suggesting distinct roles for effectors towards susceptibility by modulating host processes. With new unprecedented detail on transcriptional reprogramming during infection in both host and pathogen, the coordinate relationships that drive host-microbe interactions and the basic processes that drive hemi-biotrophy can now be explored. Importantly, and with the availability of genome sequences for both hosts and distinct classes of pathogens that share parasitic lifestyles, it is possible to identify and study the processes that underpin pathogen lifestyles. Given that major transcriptional switches can be observed in both Phytophthora and tomato during infection, deliberate alteration of lifestyle-associated transcriptional changes may allow prevention or perhaps disruption of hemi-biotrophic disease cycles, and limit damage caused by epidemics."
"107","Thermal stress effects on grain yield in Brachypodium distachyon occur via H2A.Z-nucleosomes","Scott A Boden, Monika Kavanová, E Jean Finnegan, Philip A Wigge","Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, John Innes Centre, CSIRO Plant Industry, Lehrstuhl für Grünlandlehre, Technische Universität München, Sainsbury Laboratory, Cambridge University","Philip A Wigge","philip.wigge@slcu.cam.ac.uk","25 June 2013","Crop plants are highly sensitive to ambient temperature, with a 1 ºC difference in temperature sufficient to affect development and yield. Monocot crop plants are particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures during the reproductive and grain-filling phases. The molecular mechanisms by which temperature influences grain development are, however, unknown. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H2A.Z-nucleosomes coordinate transcriptional responses to higher temperature. We therefore investigated whether the effects of high temperature on grain development are mediated by H2A.Z-nucleosomes., We have analyzed the thermal responses of the Pooid grass, Brachypodium distachyon, a model system for crops. We find that H2A.Z-nucleosome occupancy is more responsive to increases in ambient temperature in the reproductive tissue of developing grains compared withvegetative seedlings. This difference correlates with strong phenotypic responses of developing grain to increased temperature, including early maturity and reduced yield. Conversely, temperature has limited impact on the timing of transition from the vegetative to generative stage, with increased temperature unable to substitute for long photoperiod induction of flowering. RNAi silencing of components necessary for H2A.Z-nucleosome deposition is sufficient to phenocopythe effects of warmer temperature on grain development., H2A.Z-nucleosomes are important in coordinating the sensitivity of temperate grasses to increased temperature during grain development. Perturbing H2A.Z occupancy, through higher temperature or genetically, strongly reduces yield. Thus, we provide a molecular understanding of the pathways through which high temperature impacts on yield. These findings may be useful for breeding crops resilient to thermal stress.","","Members of the Pooideae grass family, including wheat, barley, oat and rye, are a major source of human nutrition. The phenology of these crop plants, and the yield and quality of grain produced are significantly influenced by temperature [1, 2], making them vulnerable to climate change [3, 4]., The effects of temperature at various stages of cereal development have been extensively studied, and optimal temperatures determined for phenological phases from sowing and emergence through to grain development (reviewed in [5]). During vegetative stages, the effects of temperature on growth are evident by the rise in leaf extension rates that occur as temperature increases [6, 7]. During generative stages, the influence of temperature on leaf extension rate increases, suggesting that monocot plants have varying degrees of thermal sensitivity depending on their developmental stage [7]. This is evident during late reproductive stages, where the effects of thermal stress are significantly stronger at anthesis and stages thereafter, compared to the double ridge stage, which is the earliest morphological sign of a reproductive plant [8]. Importantly, this includes a major effect of increasing temperature during endosperm development, with growth at moderately high temperatures of 27°C to 32°C reducing the duration of grain filling without a compensatory increase in the rate of grain filling, resulting in significantly reduced yield [9–12]. Increased temperatures also affect the transcriptome of developing grain, resulting in grain at elevated temperatures having a more advanced developmental age [13–15]. Taken together, these results indicate there is a genome-wide mechanism that integrates thermal information into the transcriptome of developing grain., In Arabidopsis thaliana, H2A.Z-nucleosomes play a key role in mediating the effects of ambient temperature on the transcriptome[16]. H2A.Z-nucleosomes are frequently found at positions surrounding the transcription start site (TSS) [17–22]. Occupancy of H2A.Z-nucleosomes at the TSS restricts access of transcriptional machinery into the gene body, and is reduced as temperature increases [16]. The reduced occupancy occurs irrespective of a given gene's transcriptional response to increased temperature, indicating eviction of H2A.Z is caused by exposure to warmer temperature and not simply a consequence of a higher transcription rate [16]. The developmental phenotypes that occur when Arabidopsis plants are exposed to warmer temperatures, including accelerated flowering, are constitutively present at cooler temperatures in genotypes compromised in their ability to incorporate H2A.Z into chromatin [16, 23–26]. H2A.Z-nucleosomes therefore provide a genome-wide mechanism by which the transcriptome can be coordinated with temperature to fine-tune development in response to the environment., To understand how crop plants respond to warmer temperatures we have used Brachypodium distachyon, a model Pooid grass and close relative of wheat and barley, which is a good exemplar of cereal biology and grain development [27, 28]. We assessed the effects of temperature on plant phenology and H2A.Z-nucleosomes of thermally responsive genes, and find that they are more pronounced in developing grain compared to vegetative seedlings. Grain from transgenic plants deficient in H2A.Z deposition resemble those of wild-type plants grown at higher temperature. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-nucleosomes are responsible for the increased thermal sensitivity of reproductive grain-filling tissue compared to vegetative tissue in monocot crop plants., Ambient temperature has a large effect on plant development, reflected in changes to the transcriptome[32, 40]. In A. thaliana, H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes are necessary to correctly express the temperature transcriptome[16]. We therefore sought to determine whether H2A.Z-mediated perception of ambient temperature is conserved in monocot plants, and whether the response to increased temperature varies between developing grain and vegetative seedlings., We have observed that chromatin sites containing H2A.Z-nucleosomes are more responsive to increases in ambient temperature in developing grains than vegetative seedlings. These molecular observations support phenological changes reported in this and other studies, which show that increased temperatures cause a greater response in plants progressing through late-reproductive development compared to those of vegetative stages. For example, the base temperature used to calculate the rate of development using thermal time in wheat is not constant throughout plant development, with the base temperatures for terminal spikelet to anthesis, and anthesis to maturity being considerably higher than that of the vegetative stages [41–43]. A differential response of vegetative and reproductive tissue to moderate and high temperature has also been observed in other plants, such as orchids and strawberry [44, 45]. Similarly, it has been shown in Arabidopsis that cold temperature treatment causes approximately ten-fold more genes to be induced in seeds than in seedlings [33]. One hypothesis for the distinct responses of vegetative and reproductive tissues is that it reflects an adaptation to low temperatures during early developmental stages and to warmer conditions during reproductive stages [42, 43]. Our findings suggest that plants may be able to modulate responsiveness to temperature in a tissue- and lifecycle-dependent manner by controlling the stability of H2A.Z-nucleosomes. To determine how direct the link between H2A.Z-nucleosomes is to the control of grain development in response to temperature, it will be necessary to identify the loci regulating this process and the binding dynamics of H2A.Z-nucleosomes to their promoters., The effect of temperature on floral initiation has been an active area of research in plant development. Here we find that increased temperature alone cannot promote flowering in non-inductive photoperiods, indicating that Brachypodium is an obligate long-day plant and that increased ambient temperature cannot compensate for photoperiod as a floral inductive signal. These observations are consistent with other studies, where it has been shown in wheat and barley that increased temperature in SD conditions does not promote floral initiation, but in fact delays the onset of reproductive development [46, 47]. Similarly, in strawberry, olive, rice flowers, perennial grasses and orchids moderately high temperatures delay or completely inhibit floral induction [44, 45, 48–50]. Taken together, these observations suggest that some plants, including annual temperate grasses such as Brachypodium, have adopted different strategies to respond to increased ambient temperature compared to Arabidopsis, where flowering is accelerated by high temperature., The results presented in this study indicate that the transcriptional responses of ripening grain to increased temperature, and the accompanied accelerated rate of development and reduction in grain weight, are at least partially mediated by H2A.Z-nucleosomes. Recent studies in wheat and barley have investigated the transcriptional events initiated by moderate and high increases in temperature during grain development [13–15]. These studies have shown that the transcriptome of a developing grain is highly responsive to increased ambient temperatures [14] and that the developmental age of the grain is more advanced at warmer temperatures, as measured transcriptionally [15]. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the negative effects of thermal stress on grain weight and quality by nullifying the transcriptional response of developing grain to increasing temperatures. This is a concept that has already been investigated in rice, where attenuating the transcriptional activity of α-amylases, which are normally up-regulated by increased temperatures, has been used to ameliorate the deleterious effects that high temperatures have on grain quality [51]. Given the broad role for H2A.Z-nucleosomes in regulating the ambient temperature transcriptome in Arabidopsis seedlings, it is possible that a large proportion of the transcriptional responses initiated by increased temperature in developing grain are coordinated by H2A.Z-nucleosomes. Therefore, reducing the responsiveness of H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes in developing grain may help improve yield and grain quality for plants grown in high temperatures. This hypothesis is supported by findings in Arabidopsis that plants which lack H2A.Z have fertility defects [26], as well as the results of this study that decreased activity of ARP6 causes reduced seed weight and increased expression of thermally responsive genes in plants grown at lower temperatures., A key question for future research will be to understand the mechanism underlying the differential response of H2A.Z-nucleosomes to increased temperature in reproductive and vegetative tissue. Histone modification is one possible explanation for the more pronounced effect of thermal stress on H2A.Z behavior in nucleosomes of developing grain compared to vegetative seedlings. Recent results in humans have shown that while H2A.Z is localized at sites surrounding the TSS of both active and poised gene promoters, acetylated H2A.Z is only found at TSSs of active genes [52]. In yeast, acetylation of H2A.Z was found to correlate with genome-wide gene activity [53], and confer with nucleosome destabilization and an open conformation of chromatin [54]. It is possible, therefore, that differences in the degree of H2A.Z acetylation may account for tissue-specific variation in thermal responsiveness. In addition to the H2A.Z-nucleosome dependent regulation of transcription, we also observe warm temperature induction of gene expression in seedlings, where no significant decreases in H2A.Z-nucleosomes are seen. This is consistent with work in Arabidopsis showing that H2A.Z-nucleosomes do not account for all the transcriptional responses to warmer temperature [16]. The identification of these parallel temperature responsive pathways will be of interest., The results presented in this work, as well as many phenological studies, suggest that Brachypodium and other grasses are more responsive to warmer temperatures as they enter the generative phase of their lifecycle. This may be because the initiation of flowering represents a point of no return, since the reproductive program must be completed. Higher temperatures would then represent an environmental cue associated with the likely onset of temperature stress and drought. Accelerating the developmental transition through this vulnerable stage to the resilient desiccated grain state may therefore be an adaptive response to anticipated abiotic stress. Conversely, activating flowering in response to warmer temperatures independently of photoperiod would risk exposing the inflorescence and the developing grains to frost [55]. This study highlights the value of complementing work in Arabidopsis with monocot systems to assess the direct applicability of Arabidopsis research to other systems, especially for traits that are important for crop yield, such as temperature perception., In common with other monocot plants, Brachypodium displays a marked difference in temperature responsiveness depending on the developmental stage. We show that the process of grain-fill is particularly sensitive to warmer temperatures. Our data indicate that H2A.Z-nucleosomes are necessary for coordinating the sensitivity of Brachypodium to increased temperature during grain development. Perturbing H2A.Z occupancy, through higher temperature or genetically, strongly reduces yield. Thus, we provide a molecular understanding of the pathways through which high temperature impacts on yield. These findings may be useful for breeding crops resilient to thermal stress."

Root hairs, or trichoblasts, tubular-shaped outgrowths of specialized cells in the epidermis, represent an ideal model for cell fate acquisition and differentiation in plants., Here, we provide an atlas of gene and protein expression in Arabidopsis root hair cells, generated by paired-end RNA sequencing and LC/MS-MS analysis of protoplasts from plants containing a pEXP7-GFP reporter construct. In total, transcripts of 23,034 genes were detected in root hairs. High-resolution proteome analysis led to the reliable identification of 2,447 proteins, 129 of which were differentially expressed between root hairs and non-root hair tissue. Dissection of pre-mRNA splicing patterns showed that all types of alternative splicing were cell type-dependent, and less complex in EXP7-expressing cells when compared to non-root hair cells. Intron retention was repressed in several transcripts functionally related to root hair morphogenesis, indicative of a cell type-specific control of gene expression by alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Concordance between mRNA and protein expression was generally high, but in many cases mRNA expression was not predictive for protein abundance., The integrated analysis shows that gene activity in root hairs is dictated by orchestrated, multilayered regulatory mechanisms that allow for a cell type-specific composition of functional components.","","Systems-wide exploration of 'omics' data obtained at different molecular levels provides a way to understand physiological or developmental processes. The fidelity of large-scale analysis of gene activity has dramatically increased because of new technologies in transcriptional profiling such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and advances in mass spectrometry (MS) techniques for protein profiling, allowing more accurate detection of expressed genes. In multicellular organisms, the correct assembly of disparate datasets derived from parallel profiling experiments is often obscured by an amalgam of different tissues or cell types, compromising the comparability of these data. Despite the technical improvements in high-throughput assays, genome-wide exploration of gene activity at the resolution of single cell types is still a challenging task., Root hairs, which differentiate from specialized cells in the epidermis, represent a well-explored model for cell differentiation and growth. Root hairs are crucial for the uptake of water and nutrients, and are important in microorganism/root interactions, thereby contributing to plant fitness. In Arabidopsis, root hairs are organized in cell files in a position-dependent manner. The fate of ceslls is dependent on their contact; cells that span the cleft of two underlying cortical cells (H position) develop into hair cells, whereas cells that are in contact with only one cortical cell (N position) develop into a non-hair cell [1]. Cell fate is determined by a complex mechanism that includes the reciprocal cell-to-cell movement of transcription factors, initiated by a positional signal that is presumably stronger in the H position and represses the expression of WEREWOLF (WER) in the future hair cells [2–4]. Root-hair formation commences with the formation of a bulge at the basal end of the epidermal cell, followed by highly polarized tip growth that results in rapid elongation of the hair. The formation of root hairs necessitates the concerted action of numerous players controlling an array of processes including reorganization of the cytoskeleton, which is guided by ROP-GTP signaling, auxin distribution, vesicle trafficking, cell wall reassembly, production of reactive oxygen species, and the establishment of ion gradients to allow proper growth of the cell [5, 6]. By comparing the transcriptional profiles of the tip growth-defective mutant rhd2 with those of the wild type, a suite of 606 genes with putative functions in root-hair morphogenesis was previously identified, yielding the first genome-wide overview of root-hair differentiation at the transcriptional level [7]. A cell type-specific gene-expression profiling study was conducted by Birnbaum et al. [8], using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of plant-root protoplasts. In that study, 10,492 genes were detected in the root, and mapped to five different tissues in three developmental root zones. This analysis was later extended into a spatiotemporal expression atlas of Arabidopsis roots, investigating 14 non-overlapping cell types and 13 root sections representing different developmental stages. The results of that study identified complex and partly fluctuating transcriptional patterns that determine cell-identity programs [9]. Cell type-specific expression profiling in response to environmental conditions identified coordinated responses in distinct cell types and showed that this approach dramatically increases the detection sensitivity for transcriptional changes compared with studies using whole roots as experimental material [10]. It was further shown that cell type-specific transcription is largely dependent on environmental conditions, with the epidermis showing the least conserved gene expression when the transcriptional profile of stressed plants was compared with that of plants grown under standard conditions [11]., A gene regulatory network, identified by comprehensive transcriptional profiling of epidermal cells from several cell-fate mutants, provided detailed insights into the transcriptional machinery regulating cell specification and root-hair development at systems level [12]. By integrating genetic, genomic, and computational analyses, this approach yielded a subset of 208 'core' root-hair genes from a large set of genes that were differentially expressed between root-hair and non-root-hair cells. These genes could be organized within the network by using information that was obtained from transcriptional analysis of root epidermis mutants after the system was perturbed by hormone treatment. A Bayesian modeling approach in combination with transcriptional profiles from different developmental stages further positioned the genes within the network., Although transcriptome analysis has yielded biological meaningful information that awaits full exploitation, several studies have shown that transcripts do not reliably predict the abundance of proteins, indicating the need for a multifaceted, integrative analysis that includes dissection of both the transcriptome and proteome to obtain a holistic picture of gene activity. Protein profiling of root protoplasts identified only modest correlation of protein and mRNA abundance [13], indicating complex regulation of gene expression. To further extend the knowledge of root-hair differentiation, we conducted an in-depth analysis at several levels of gene expression without introducing either conceptual (that is, by experiments being carried out in different laboratories) or technical (that is, by amplification of RNA samples or by fixed probe sets) bias. This dataset includes quantitative information on transcript abundance and composition, cell type-dependent splicing variants, proteins that differentially accumulate in root hairs, and post-translational modifications. The easily mined dataset provides a guide towards understanding how gene function is integrated to control the development and function of root hairs., Integration, analysis, and interpretation of data from different 'omics' levels remain a major challenge in systems biology. Our analysis provides a comprehensive, multilayered reference map of the Arabidopsis root hair without bias caused by amplification, tissue heterogeneity, or factors introduced when independently collected data are merged. This dataset catalogues the components of root-hair cells and may aid in deciphering the molecular machinery that orchestrates cell-differentiation processes and thus deepen our understanding of the regulation of these processes. Our dataset complements and extents previous transcriptomic and proteomic studies in Arabidopsis using either mutants with defects in root-hair morphogenesis and subsequent transcriptomic or proteomic profiling, or FACS-based approaches, or combinations of the two [9, 11–13, 35, 36]. We compared the root-hair (EXP7) datasets with data obtained from analyzing all root tissues except root hairs (non-GFP), allowing disclosure of differentially expressed genes and proteins without distorting data by using a separate GFP reporter line for non-root-hair cells, which might differ in terms of signal strength or in the spatial expression of the reporter chimera. From a total of 22,251 identified genes, 7.3% were classified as differentially expressed between root hairs and non-GFP cells. From the 12,492 proteins identified in roots, 2,447 were detected in EXP7 cells. From these proteins, a subset of 129 (5.3%) proteins accumulated differentially. Taking into account the different methods for determination and for calculating thresholds for differential expression, these numbers are comparable, providing a robust database for comparing differential gene expression at the transcript and protein level., A subset of 93 genes was expressed specifically in root hairs (reads per 1 Kbps of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) <1 in non-GFP cells). Contained in this set were several RHE motif-containing genes and other genes that have been associated with root-hair differentiation such as MRH6, LRX1, and DER4. As anticipated, most root hair-specific genes encode cell wall-related proteins such as extensins, arabinogalactan proteins, xyloglucan endotransglucosylases, and pectinesterases. In addition, several genes with putative functions in signaling pathways, such as transcription factors, protein kinases, and ROP GTPase-related genes, were specifically expressed in root hairs. Small GTP-binding proteins play crucial roles in signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. Three genes involved in the regulation of Rho-like small GTPases (ROPs) were within this group. RHO GUANYL NUCLEOTIDE EXCHANGE FACTOR 4 (ROPGEF4; also known as RHS11) was shown to regulate ROP11-mediated cell-wall pattern in xylem cells. In roots, ROPGEF4 is crucial for the control of root-hair elongation under Pi-deficient conditions [19]. ROP-INTERACTIVE CRIB MOTIF-CONTAINING PROTEIN 1 (RIC1) is a key player in the signaling network dictating the shape of leaf pavement cells by controlling the organization of cortical microtubules [37]. Notably, RIC1 is coexpressed with another cell-specific gene, the protein kinase At5g18910. The third GTPase-related gene in this group is the RAB GTPASE HOMOLOG H1D (RABH1D). RABH1D is coexpressed with the AGC kinase INCOMPLETE ROOT HAIR ELONGATION (IRE), which has specific expression in root hairs and is essential for root-hair elongation [38]. Given the crucial roles of these proteins in cell shape, the root hair-specific expression pattern highlights the important function of the Rho-signaling network in root-hair differentiation. and implicates ROPGEF4, RIC1, and RABH1D as key components., Large differences between EXP7 and non-GFP cells were seen in the abundance of transcripts coding for mineral-nutrient transporters. Root hairs provide a large proportion of the interface of the plant and the rhizosphere, thus, a higher abundance of transcripts encoding proteins involved in the uptake of nutrients from the soil solution in root hairs would be expected. Transporters with clearly defined roles in nutrient acquisition from the soil solution such as SULTR1;1 and NRT2;1 were highly expressed in EXP7 cells and virtually absent in non-GFP cells, suggesting specific roles of the encoded proteins in root hairs (Table 2). However, we cannot exclude that these genes are highly enriched in a small subset of tissues that is masked by the current approach. Interestingly, the proton ATPase AHA7 was specifically expressed in root hairs. We previously showed that AHA7 is upregulated by iron deficiency, but is not important for rhizosphere acidification, a process that aids in the acquisition of iron [23]. Rather, we found that AHA7 is crucial for the formation of root hairs, a process that is affected by iron deficiency [39]. Regulation of the extracellular pH is crucial for cell-wall expansion in root hairs and pollen tubes [40, 41]. Thus, the strong enrichment of AHA7 transcripts in EXP7 cells might indicate a root hair-specific function of AHA7, possibly oscillatory acidification of the apoplast of the root-hair tip [40].Table 2

                  , Transcriptionally coordinated genes often participate in a common function. We used a selective coexpression approach to identify previously unrecognized genes important in root-hair differentiation, using genes that were preferentially expressed in EXP7 as an input for network construction. Coexpression networks are usually assembled by clustering differentially expressed genes against a database comprising microarray experiments that cover a wide range of tissues and conditions, often leading to the inclusion of unrelated genes [42]. To strengthen the 'guilt by association' approach, we selected microarray experiments based on a suite of genes with confirmed function in root-hair development. For five genes in this network, mutant analysis identified novel roles in tip growth. Expression of At3g49960 was found to be upregulated by nutrient deprivation, and this upregulation was dependent on the NADPH oxidase RHD2 [43]. Further, At3g49960 was found to be preferentially expressed in root-hair cells, and this expression pattern was associated with higher H3K4me3 and lower H3K27me3 levels in root-hair cells relative to non-root-hair cells [44]. Gene activity of the peroxidase superfamily protein At1g05240 was detected preferentially in root hairs both at the transcript and protein level. Root hair-specific expression of the protein and a high transcript level that was approximately 650 times more abundant in EXP7 cells than in non-GFP cells suggest an important function of At1g05240 in root-hair morphogenesis, which is yet to be characterized. Mutants defective in this gene formed shorter and irregular hairs compared with the wild type (see Additional file 1, Figure S4). Another protein not previously associated with root-hair development was the Zn-responsive metal transporter ZIP3 [45]. Homozygous zip3 mutants formed shorter root hairs, indicative of a role of Zn in tip growth. Another Zn-regulated gene, IRT2, was present in the network generated in the present study and also in the gene regulatory network reported by Bruex et al. [12], supporting a role for Zn or other transition metals that might be transported by ZIP3 and IRT2 in root-hair elongation. CCP3 is a serine protease inhibitor that has a predicted ancestral ciliary function and has been maintained in non-ciliated plants, probably to perform novel functions [46]. In addition, we confirmed roles for AHA7 and PIP 2;4 in root-hair development., Alternative splicing generates diverse transcript isoforms from a limited number of protein-coding genes, leading to proteins that potentially possess unique functions. Alternatively, in combination with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), unproductive mRNA splicing can lead to the synthesis and subsequent degradation of non-functional transcripts, thereby providing an alternative route of gene regulation (regulated unproductive splicing and translation; RUST) [25, 47, 48]. In plants, the most abundant types of alternative splicing are intron retention and alternative donor/acceptor [25, 26, 49], and the question as to whether alternative splicing, on a global scale, is of physiological significance or is due to 'noisy' splicing of pre-mRNA is still open to debate. FACS-based techniques allowed for detailed investigations into cell type-specific gene expression; however, information regarding differences in splicing patterns between different organs, tissues, or cell types in plants is rare. Although our data do not directly address the biological relevance of alternative splicing, several lines of evidence makes it reasonable to assume that alternative splicing represents an important, but, in plants, largely unexplored layer of gene regulation. First, alternative splicing is less complex in root hairs compared with non-GFP cells. Assuming a function of alternative splicing that exceeds stochastic fluctuations, it can be assumed that the population of pre-mRNAs subjected to alternative splicing varies with the structure and function of the cell type, and is more intricate when several cell types are analyzed together. Second, intron retention was largely induced in EXP7 cells, but was strongly repressed for a subset of genes, many of which encode proteins crucial to root-hair morphogenesis. Unproductive alternative splicing has been shown to control the number of physiological transcripts in plants [50]. Splicing accuracy can provide a mechanism to fine-tune gene expression, adjusting protein activity to the desired level. Importantly, and in line with this explanation, we found that intron retention was largely repressed in genes comprising the coexpression network, which probably contain nodes with relevant functions in root-hair development. Thus, transcripts with crucial functions in a certain cell type or functional context seem to be more likely to be spliced with high fidelity. This was evident for a number of genes encoding protein kinases and phosphatases, suggesting that protein phosphorylation is largely regulated at the post-transcriptional level., Although a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional profile of Arabidopsis root hairs is emerging from various approaches, the root-hair proteome has been much less explored. A recent study documented 1,363 proteins expressed in root hairs [13]. The current survey extends this list to 2,447 root-hair proteins, 96 of which accumulated differentially between EXP7 and non-GFP cells, and 33 of which were specifically expressed in root hairs. The overlap of our study and the previous one is represented by a subset of 935 proteins, indicating a high correlation between the two surveys. Of the 33 root hair-specific proteins, At1g05240 has been identified in the coexpression cluster as being crucial for root-hair elongation (see Additional file 1, Figure S4). The putative cysteine proteinase At3g43960 was one of eight loci previously identified as being involved in root-hair elongation under phosphate-deficient conditions from a coexpression network of phosphate-responsive genes [19]. In the same screen, another root hair-specific protein, the EF-hand-containing At1g24620, was found to be crucial for root-hair elongation. Although these findings support the assumption that the root hair-specific proteins identified here are crucial in root-hair morphogenesis, it is interesting to note that many proteins in this group were not associated with differential expression of their cognate transcript, supporting the assumption that the transcript level is an insufficient proxy for protein abundance in a certain cell type., With few exceptions, the proteins with preferred expression in EXP7 cells have not been previously associated with root-hair formation, but for many of them, a putative function in specific processes related to tip growth can be inferred from related proteins with defined functions. For example, the cell membrane-anchored formin homology protein FH5 was among the proteins that were strongly enriched in root hairs. Formins are actin-nucleating proteins with key roles in root-hair formation and pollen-tube growth. FH5 drives tip growth in pollen tubes by stimulating apical actin assembly [51]. Ectopic expression of another FH family protein, FH8, resulted in severely deformed root hairs and formation of multiple bulges [52] indicating a crucial function of FH8 in root-hair initiation and elongation; a similar function may be deduced for FH5. Another member of this family, FH2, for which no specific function has been described, was exclusively found in root-hair cells (see Additional file 4, Table S4). Transcript levels for both FH2 and FH5 were similar in EXP7 and non-GFP cells, indicating post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance., In addition to alternative splicing, post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins contributes to the functional diversity of the proteome. For many of the identified proteins, extensive modifications were detected in our study. Similar to a previous report [53], most of the modified peptides were either carbamidomethylated at cysteine, or oxidized at methionine. Oxidation of methionine, if occurring in vivo, may have functional implications as a redox switch. Acetylation was the second most pronounced peptide modification, including acetylation of the N-terminal α-amine of peptides and acetylation of the protein N-terminus, as well as acetylation of lysine, neutralizing the positive charge of this amino acid. Protein acetylation plays a crucial role in transcription regulation [54]. Recent studies showed that lysine acetylation acts as a regulatory switch in both human and prokaryote cellular metabolism by altering protein activity or stability [55, 56]. Of particular interest is the regulation of the reversible phosphorylation of proteins. Our analysis shows that many protein kinases and phosphatases are preferentially expressed in root hairs and are robustly regulated by cell type-specific intron retention, indicating extensive regulation of protein phosphorylation at the post-transcriptional level. The pronounced effect of DAS on protein phosphorylation was in contrast to several over-represented GO processes that were associated with differential gene expression, but only to a minor extent with DAS (Figure 8). It is possible that, in general, processes that require fast regulation and the integration of several internal and external signals are more affected by DAS, whereas 'molecular machines' related to the assembly of biological structures are chiefly regulated by differential expression., Taken together, the transcriptome/proteome comparison at single cell-type resolution sets the stage for an integrative, functional interpretation of large-scale datasets. The central dogma of molecular biology proposes a highly correlated abundance of mRNA and protein. As anticipated from other integrative studies, we found that transcript and protein abundance were not always concordant, making analysis of these different levels of regulations mandatory for a comprehensive understanding of the processes that drive cell differentiation. It is obvious from the present investigation that cell differentiation is an integrated readout of several levels of regulation, including transcription, mRNA processing, translation, and PTMs of protein, levels that are not necessarily congruent with each other. This and other studies suggest that an understanding of processes related to cell differentiation and function requires study of all of these layers to deduce key regulatory circuits, and a holistic understanding of concerted interactions of several system components that act together as molecular machines in metabolic and regulatory pathways. The current compendium of proteins, transcripts, and splicing variants provides a plethora of candidates for further studies into the molecular mechanisms that drive root-hair differentiation., Protein quantification was based on the NSAF method [30]. The NSAF for a protein P is calculated by the equation P = k/L × SpC, where K is the number of spectral counts for one protein, L is the length of the protein, and SpC is the sum of all proteins in the experment. For statistical analysis of the dataset, the natural log of each NSAF ratio of EXP7/non-GFP was calculated. Proteins with significant changes in abundance between two samples were selected using a method described by Cox and Mann [31]. The mean and standard deviation (SD) from the log2 ratios of the 1,774 quantified proteins overlapping in both biological repeats was calculated. Next, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (Z score = 1.96) were used to select proteins whose distribution was removed from the main distribution. For the downregulated proteins, the 95% CI was -0.2212 (mean ratio of the 1,774 proteins) − 1.96 × 1.2033 (SD), corresponding to a protein ratio of 0.167. Similarly, for the upregulated proteins, the mean 95% CI was calculated (mean ratio + 1.96 × SD), corresponding to a protein ratio of 4.399. Protein ratios outside this range were defined as being significantly different at P <0.05. The threshold values were validated by power analysis with β = 0.80., The MS proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository [65] with the dataset identifier PXD000195 [29]."

Current challenges include understanding how genetic variation translates into phenotypic performance in the field., Genomics, the analysis of an organism's complete DNA sequence, has been one of the most transformative influences on biological studies. The genome sequences of organisms are fundamentally important for understanding the functions of individual genes and their networks, for defining evolutionary relationships and processes, and for revealing previously unknown regulatory mechanisms that coordinate the activities of genes. These genomics-based approaches are having a profound influence on both human disease diagnostics and treatment [1] and, equally importantly, on the improvement of crops for food and fuel production. In this review, we summarize progress in sequencing crop genomes, identify remaining technical challenges, and describe how genomics-based applications can aid crop improvement. We then assess the impact of genomics on plant breeding and crop improvement, showing how it is accelerating the improvement of staple and 'orphan' crops, and facilitating the utilization of untapped allelic variation. Finally, we speculate about the future impacts of genomics on plant biology and crop improvement by developing the concept of systems breeding, which integrates information on gene function, genome states, and regulatory networks across populations and species to create a predictive framework for estimating the contributions of genetic and epigenetic variation to phenotypes and field performance., Advances in sequencing crop genomes have mirrored the development of sequencing technologies (Table 1). Until 2010, Sanger sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical maps was the predominant approach used to access crop genomes such as rice, poplar and maize [1–3]. The rice genome comprises complete sequences of individual BACs assembled into physical maps that are anchored to genetic maps, whereas for maize, the sequences of individual BACs were not completely finished. For poplar, grapevine, sorghum and soybean [2, 4–6], whole genome shotgun (WGS) reads of libraries of randomly sheared fragments of different sizes and of BAC end sequences (BES) were assembled with powerful assembly algorithms such as ARACHNE [7, 8]. The trade-offs that shaped genome-sequencing strategies in the era before next-generation sequencing became available involved coverage, time and expense. Physical maps of BACs provide a good template for completing gaps and errors, but genome coverage of physical maps can be non-representative due to cloning bias. In addition, intensive hand-crafting is required to assess physical map integrity and to close gaps; this effort scales directly with genome size and complexity.Table 1

                      aWGD alloploids have a whole-genome duplication in recent lineage. bA contig is an unambiguous linear assembly of sequences with no physical gaps in coverage, but which can contain errors. cThe terms supercontig, scaffold or metacontig are used interchangeably to describe a set of contigs that are linked by a known physical distance but that contain sequence gaps. These scaffolds are usually created using mate-pair reads and BAC end sequences. dPseudomolecule is a term applied to a chromosome-scale assembly of contigs and scaffolds that is anchored to a long-range framework using genetic markers and other chromosome features, including cytogenetic features and deletions.
                  , The sorghum genome [1–3, 5] was the first crop genome to be sequenced completely by the exclusive use of WGS sequence assemblies, which were then assessed for integrity using high-density genetic maps and physical maps. This pioneering analysis showed that scaffolds of Sanger sequence assemblies accurately span extensive repetitive DNA tracts and extend into telomeric and centromeric regions. The larger soybean genome was subsequently sequenced to similar high standards. The soybean genome is thought to be pseudo-diploid, derived from the diploidization of an allopolyploid in the past 50 million years [2, 4–6, 9], and this project successfully demonstrated that WGS assemblies are not confounded by large-scale genome duplication events., By 2010 to 2011, a mixture of sequencing technologies, all using WGS assembly methods, were being successfully applied to trees (apple, cacao and date palm), fruit (strawberry), vegetables (potato and Chinese cabbage) and forage crops (alfalfa relative) [10–16]. The Medicago and tomato [17] projects, which were initiated in the BAC-based Sanger sequencing era, were completed using next-generation sequencing. The contiguity of assemblies varied according to genome composition and size, with very high contiguity being achieved in potato and alfalfa by alignment to BAC sequences. The Brassica genomes are among the most challenging to sequence with respect to achieving large-scale assemblies because they have undergone three recent whole-genome duplications followed by partial diploidization [18]. Polyploidy has a centrally important role in plant genome evolution and in the formation of important crop genomes. Figure 1 illustrates three examples of polyploidy and how these events contribute to crop genetic diversity in different ways. In Brassica species, polyploidy has led to extensive structural heterogeneity and gene copy number variation when compared with their close relative Arabidopsis. The Brassica rapa genome sequence remains fragmentary, but alignments of Brassica chromosome segments to the Arabidopsis genome are exceptionally useful for advanced genetic analysis [19].
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Diverse outcomes of polyploidy in crop species. Three examples of the consequences of allopolyploidy (in which hybrids have sets of chromosomes derived from different species) in important crop species are shown. (a) Oilseed rape (canola) is derived from a recent hybridization of Brassica rapa (Chinese cabbage, turnip) and Brassica oleraceae (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage). The progenitor of these Brassica species was hexaploid (compared to Arabidopsis) after two rounds of whole-genome duplication. Extensive gene loss, possibly via deletion mechanisms [18], has occurred in these species. Upon hybridization to form allotetraploid Brassica napus, gene loss is accelerated, producing novel patterns of allelic diversity [19]. (b) Bread wheat is an allohexaploid derived from the relatively recent hybridization of allotetraploid durum (pasta) wheat and wild goat grass, Aeglilops tauschii. The Ph1 locus in the B genome [37] prevents pairing between the A, B and D genomes, leading to diploid meiosis and genome stability. This maintains the extensive genetic diversity from the three progenitor Triticeae genomes that underpins wheat crop productivity. (c) Sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) is a complex and unstable polyploid that is cultivated by cuttings. Hybrids between S. officinarum, which has high sugar content, and S. spontaneum, a vigorous wild relative, have variable chromosomal content from each parent. The genomes are closely related to the ancestral diploid Sorghum [42].
                    , In its early stages, crop genomics relied on many small-scale science laboratories joining forces to generate the sequence data. However, this has changed radically with the emergence and leadership of large-scale genome sequencing centers, which focused their expertise and resources on important crop genomes. Two examples are the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in the USA and the Beijing Genome Institute (BGI, Shenzen) in China, both of which provide exceptional expertise, capacity and levels of engagement with researchers. These centers and others are currently sequencing the genomes of many crucially important food and fuel crops, and are working in collaboration with science groups worldwide on improving our functional understanding of these genomes., Since 2012, analyses of the sequences of 12 crop genomes have been published, accounting for nearly half of the total published (Table 1) [20–28]. This explosion of data has been driven by cheaper and more effective sequencing technologies (primarily the Illumina [29] and Roche 454 [30] methods) coupled with increasingly sophisticated sequence and assembly strategies [31], which are generally delivered by large genome centers. Access to these technologies makes even a reasonably large crop genome project affordable and feasible within the period of a single research grant, and is having a major influence on strategies in crop genomics. For example, the role of multi-partner coordination has changed from raising and coordinating research funding and managing the distribution of research activities to a focus on data analyses, distribution and applications. These changes will further accelerate and greatly diversify the range of plant species and varieties sequenced., The date palm genome [12] was sequenced using just paired end reads and remains fragmentary. Although this could be partly attributed to repeat composition, it is clear that the use of mate-pair libraries of different lengths, which provide accurately spaced pairs of sequence reads, substantially improves contiguity across medium-sized genomes of up to 1,000 Mb, as can be seen for citrus, diploid cotton, pigeonpea, chickpea and banana [21, 24, 25, 32, 33]. Contig and scaffold sizes were further increased in chickpea and pigeonpea by incorporating BES generated by Sanger sequence that have much longer read lengths paired over a 100 kb span. Increased lengths of Illumina reads, of up to 250 bases, are now available to users and should further improve contiguity. Using new assembly algorithms, the large genome of bamboo, a plant of major industrial and ecological significance, has recently been published [34]., Table 1 shows progress in sequencing two much larger Triticeae genomes, those of diploid barley (5,100 Mb) [27] and hexaploid bread wheat (17,000 Mb) [28]. Both the exceptional scale and high repeat content (approximately 80%) of these genomes provide significant challenges to straightforward WGS sequencing and assembly, with genes being separated by hundreds of kb of repeats such as nested retroelements [35]. In barley, a physical map of 67,000 BAC clones with a cumulative length of 4.98 Gb provided 304,523 BES reads as a framework for integration of 50X Illumina paired end and 2.5 kb mate pair reads. Contig median size was just 1.5 kb because the repeat content collapsed longer assemblies. Sequence assemblies were integrated with genetic and physical maps, and genic assemblies were assigned to chromosome arms. The chromosomal order of barley genes was then interpolated using synteny across multiple sequenced grass genomes and by ordering the genes according to the genetic or physical maps [36] (Figure 2).

                        The impact of whole genome sequencing on breeding. (a) Initial genetic maps consisted of few and sparse markers, many of which were anonymous markers (simple sequence repeats (SSR)) or markers based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). For example, if a phenotype of interest was affected by genetic variation within the SSR1-SSR2 interval, the complete region would be selected with little information about its gene content or allelic variation. (b) Whole genome sequencing of a closely related species enabled projection of gene content onto the target genetic map. This allowed breeders to postulate the presence of specific genes on the basis of conserved gene order across species (synteny), although this varies between species and regions. (c) Complete genome sequence in the target species provides breeders with an unprecedented wealth of information that allows them to access and identify variation that is useful for crop improvement. In addition to providing immediate access to gene content, putative gene function and precise genomic positions, the whole genome sequence facilitates the identification of both natural and induced (by TILLING) variation in germplasm collections and copy number variation between varieties. Promoter sequences allow epigenetic states to be surveyed, and expression levels can be monitored in different tissues or environments and in specific genetic backgrounds using RNAseq or microarrays. Integration of these layers of information can create gene networks, from which epistasis and target pathways can be identified. Furthermore, re-sequencing of varieties identifies a high density of SNP markers across genomic intervals, which enable genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genomic selection (GS) and more defined marker-assisted selection (MAS) strategies.
                    , The bread wheat genome is a recent hexaploid composed of three related genomes (A, B and D), each the size of the barley genome, which do not pair and recombine, leading to their independent maintenance [37] (Figure 1). The challenge for wheat WGS strategies was to provide independent assemblies covering and representing genes from each homoeologous genome. The two closest diploid progenitors of the A and D genomes were sequenced to identify polymorphisms that could be used to assess WGS gene assemblies. Low coverage (5X) Roche 454 sequence was generated, and orthologous gene sequences from multiple grasses were used to guide assemblies. Approximately 94,000 genes were assembled and positively assigned to the A and D genomes using genome-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with the remaining assemblies tentatively assigned to the B genome. Wheat gene assemblies, which are fragmentary compared to barley gene assemblies, were assigned to chromosomes using high-density genetic maps and conserved gene order., The current wheat and barley gene-based assemblies are suitable for developing genetic markers [38] and for creating genetic maps for map-based cloning and marker-assisted breeding. To increase the gene coverage and contiguity of the barley genome, BACs in the physical map are being multiplex-sequenced using Illumina methods. This will result in chromosome assemblies with fewer gaps and more precisely ordered genes. This should establish barley as the pre-eminent genomic template and genetic reference for the Triticeae. On-going efforts in sequencing the bread wheat genome include sequencing purified flow-sorted chromosome arms to increase gene coverage and the complete assignment of homoeologous genes to the A, B, or D genome [39]. Constructing physical maps of BAC libraries made from purified chromosomes is also underway, with the chromosome 3B physical map [40] and BAC sequencing completed. Given sufficient funding and time, this strategy will provide the necessary high-quality reference genome. Since homoeologous genes can now be assembled and assigned to their genome, WGS can be used to improve the contiguity of wheat gene sequences by using long mate pair spans, in non-overlapping increments up to 40 kb using fosmid vectors [41], coupled to longer read lengths. New template preparation methods, such as Illumina Moleculo, which breaks assemblies down into separate 10 kb units, could be used to span large repeat units and to facilitate accurate assemblies covering large tracts of repeats. Although a colossal amount of sequencing is required, a whole-genome strategy for wheat, supplemented by the flow-sorted chromosome arm data, has the potential to provide users with a high-quality draft sequence relatively quickly and cheaply., Several industrially important species, such as the conifers Norway spruce (Picea abies) [42] and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), have very large genomes (approximately 20,000 to 24,000 Mb, respectively). They are being sequenced using WGS strategies involving fosmid pool sequencing and Illumina long-mate pair methods [43]. These tree species have particular characters that facilitate their genome analysis, including the absence of whole-genome duplication in their ancestry, relatively inactive retroelements and the presence of a large multicellular haploid gametophyte, the sequence of which does not exhibit heterozygosity., Sugar cane, another important crop plant, is a hybrid between Saccharum officinarum and Saccharum
                spontaneum. These species are closely related to sorghum [44] and have haploid contents of 8 and 10 base chromosomes, respectively. Both S. officinarum and S. spontaneum have a monoploid genome size close to that of sorghum (760 Mb), but they are highly autopolyploid (2n = 80 and 2n = 40-128, respectively), resulting in a genome size of >15 Gb for hybrid sugar cane. Commercial cultivars are derived by backcrossing hybrids to S. officinarum, resulting in lines that have different chromosome contributions from each parental species [45]. The highly variable and heterozygous composition of commercial sugarcane genomes is a major challenge to genome sequencing. The sequencing of progenitor genomes, using WGS strategies and sorghum genes as templates, could create high-stringency orthologous gene assemblies. As in the analysis of the wheat draft genome, this strategy would generate information on ortholog copy number and identify sequence polymorphisms that could be used to genetically map desirable traits in the two progenitor species. Upon the development of commercial hybrids from sequenced progenitors, re-sequencing could identify desired genotypes and gene copy numbers., A similar approach could be used for the biomass crop Miscanthus x giganteus, a sterile triploid derived from Miscanthus sinensis and tetraploid Miscanthus sacchariflorus. A recent genetic analysis has shown that M. sinensis has recently undergone whole-genome duplication [46] and a single dysploid chromosome fusion [47], neither of which occurred in the closely related sorghum genome [48]. The WGS strategy developed for wheat could be also applied to M. sinensis and its hybrids to determine gene copy numbers and to identify genetic variation in homoeologous gene copies., It is reasonable to predict that within the next two years useful genome sequences will be available to support the genetic improvement of most of the important food and fuel crops. Crop improvement will depend, however, on the identification of useful genetic variation and its utilization by breeding and transformation. Such variation can be identified at a genome scale by comparison of multiple sequence reads to a single 'reference'. For example, in rice, low-coverage sequence of 1,083 Oryza sativa and 466 Oryza rufipogon (the progenitor species of cultivated rice) accessions [49] provided deep insights into the domestication of rice and the geographical distribution of variation, while providing material for quantitative trait loci (QTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [50]. The gene spaces of maize and wheat varieties are being re-sequenced using sequence capture methods that are based on the solution hybridization of sheared genomic DNA with biotinylated long overlapping oligos designed from gene sequences [51, 52]. The captured DNA is highly enriched in genic sequences, and its deep sequencing can distinguish closely related genes, including wheat homoeologs [53]. These approaches will facilitate the high-throughput sequencing of the gene space of multiple lines of crops, even those with very large polyploid genomes. These methods offer the ability to sequence rapidly the genomes or gene space of multiple accessions, wild relatives and even new species, which will undoubtedly accelerate the incorporation of unexplored and underutilized genetic variation into crops worldwide [54]. DNA sequence variation remains a primary focus, but extensive evidence from several crop species [55, 56] suggests that epigenetic changes are responsible for a range of stably heritable traits, and that epigenetic variation can be both induced and selected for during domestication [57]. The methylation status of captured DNA can be measured using bisulfite treatment followed by deep sequencing in a method called reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) [58]. These important technological advances in sequence template preparation will permit the exceptionally detailed and cost-effective definition of variation in the sequences and epigenomes of multiple lines or species of crops, independently of their genome size and polyploid status [59]., Accessing genome-wide sequence variation by re-sequencing significantly improves the availability of information that can be used to develop markers, thereby enhancing the genetic mapping of agronomic traits. For example, in wheat, fewer than 500 SNP markers were available in 2008 [60] with that number increasing to 1,536 in 2010 [61], 10,000 in 2011 and over 90,000 in 2012 [38]. This relatively high-density SNP information is proving extremely useful across different systems, including QTL mapping in bi-parental crosses and recombinant inbred lines, GWAS, and mapping QTL in advanced inter-cross lines such as those in multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) [62] and nested association mapping (NAM) [63] populations. These approaches generally identify loci and causal genes for traits with relatively large phenotypic effects. The genomic segments that contain desired allelic variation can then be bred and combined in a single genetic background using markers to track the segments through marker-assisted selection (MAS)., Many important agricultural traits such as yield, however, result from relatively small effects across multiple loci. This implies that these loci might not be optimally identified through QTL or GWAS approaches and that their pyramiding through MAS will be inefficient. Therefore, breeders have begun to address these problems by developing a knowledge base of associations of polymorphic markers with phenotypes in breeding populations [64, 65]. These associations are used to develop a breeding model in which the frequency of desired marker alleles is optimized, thereby maximizing the estimated breeding value [66, 67]. Multiple cycles of selection are used to accumulate favorable alleles that are associated with desired phenotypes, although no causal relationship between a specific gene and a phenotype is established. This approach, termed genomic selection (GS) is incorporated into industrial-scale breeding processes that require very cheap high-throughput marker assays [68]. Next-generation sequencing of parental lines is influencing GS in several ways: by continuing to identify polymorphisms throughout the genome in both genic and inter-genic regions; by providing estimates of gene expression levels; and by providing information on the epigenetic states of genes (Figure 2). The first removes any limitations on marker density, while the latter two features are 'genomic features' that will surely have predictive power for complex traits. Speculatively, the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE) concept [69] of total genomic knowledge could eventually be incorporated into models for predicting performance from genomic information revealed by next-generation sequencing., Breeding uses natural allelic variation to improve crop performance. Sequence variation can be experimentally enhanced using, for example, ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) to alkylate bases. TILLING (targeted induced local lesions in genomes) [70] is then used to screen for base changes in genes of interest to assess gene function and to create advantageous alleles for breeding. It is now feasible to use genome capture to sequence an entire mutant population, even in complex polyploid genomes such as wheat [52]. Here, polyploidy provides an advantage by buffering the influence of otherwise deleterious mutation loads., Genetic manipulation using the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transfer of genes from any other organism is a mature technology that has been adapted for use in many of the crop species listed in Table 1. The precise modification of gene sequences using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) that can be engineered to recognize specific DNA sequences has been applied to a target locus in maize [71]. More recently a new type of precision tool for genome engineering has been developed from the prokaryotic clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas9 immune system [72, 73]. The Cas9 nuclease is guided to specific target sequences for cleavage by an RNA molecule. Several types of genome editing are possible, such as the simultaneous editing of multiple sites, inducing deletions, and inserting new sequences by nick-mediated repair mechanisms., Genomics has radically altered the scope of genetics by providing a landscape of ordered genes and their epigenetic states, access to an enormous range of genetic variation, and the potential to measure gene expression directly with high precision and accuracy (Figure 2). This not only has important practical advantages for breeding but also facilitates systematic comparison of gene functions across sequenced genomes, bringing the wealth of knowledge of gene function and networks obtained in experimental species directly into the ambit of crop improvement. Given a suitable cyber-infrastructure, the integration of biological knowledge and models of networks across species, in a two-way flow from crops to experimental species and back again, will begin to generate new layers of knowledge that can be used for crop improvement. One layer is provided by ENCODE-level analyses [69]; although yet to start in plants, these analyses can guide the interpretation of gene function and variation, thus providing new information to inform the prediction of phenotype from genotype. Another information layer is provided by the systems-level integration of gene function into networks, such as those controlling flowering time in response to day-length and over-wintering (Figure 2). These networks have been identified in Arabidopsis and rice, with allelic variation in key 'hubs' strongly influencing network outputs. Evolutionary processes, such as gene duplication, and the possible footprints of domestication can be mapped to networks such as those controlling flowering time [74, 75]. Such 'systems breeding' approaches can use diverse genomic information to increase the precision with which phenotype can be predicted from genotype, thereby accelerating crop improvement and helping to address food security."

The 'circadian' clockwork (from Latin circa diem, about one day) is entrained to the periodic light regime of the environment: plants use this information to control internal processes so that they take place at the most appropriate time of day for maximal output and performance. This global system works at various genomic levels., The core clockwork consists of negative feedback loops through which clock proteins sustain their own 24-h rhythm [3–6]. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the Myb-type transcription factors LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) oscillate with a peak around dawn (Figure 1a). LHY and CCA1 activate the expression of four PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATORs (PRRs) that are sequentially expressed, starting with PRR9 in the morning, followed by PRR7, PRR5 and TOC1/PRR1. This activation occurs indirectly via inhibition of the evening complex (EC), which is a repressor of the PRRs (Figure 1b); three proteins, LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX)/PHYTOCLOCK1 (PCL1) and the plant-specific proteins EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) and ELF4, interact to form the EC. The PRRs induce the EC in the late evening, whereas CCA1 and LHY repress EC expression. The EC, in turn, indirectly activates CCA1 and LHY by directly inhibiting the repressive PRRs. These and other clock proteins regulate rhythmic molecular and biochemical processes in the cell (Figure 1c) (see section 'From a single oscillating mRNA to the rhythmic transcriptome'). These molecular-genetic events have been integrated into quite sophisticated systems models (reviewed at a systems level in Bujdoso and Davis [7]).
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Circadian oscillations in clock gene expression lead to a global rhythm of large parts of the transcriptome. (a) Oscillations of the Arabidopsis thaliana clock genes across the day. The open bar refers to day, the dark bar refers to night. The numbers indicate hours after lights on. Please note that the amplitude of the oscillations is arbitrarily chosen to be equal for all transcripts. (b) Blueprint of the circadian oscillator in Arabidopsis thaliana. The core loop consists of the Myb-type transcription factors CCA1 and LHY, and the Pseudo response regulator TOC1, which reciprocally regulate each others' oscillations. Interconnected with the core loop are the morning and the evening loops. In the morning loop, CCA1 and LHY activate PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9, which in turn leads to inhibition of CCA1 and LHY. In the evening loop, the evening complex (EC), a protein complex consisting of ELF3, ELF4 and LUX, inhibits expression of PRR9 and perhaps other PRRs. EC components are themselves rhythmic through repression by CCA1 and LHY. Additional transcription factors, such as RVE8 and CHE, modulate these interconnected loops. (c) Oscillations in the output genes can be accomplished through direct binding of rhythmically expressed clock proteins to phase modules in their promoters or via intermediate transcription factors (TF). In this way, transcripts are directed to different times of the day. As one example, components involved in metabolizing sugars produced through photosynthesis peak early in the day, and components involved in starch degradation, in turn, peak in the middle of the night [12].
                    , Overall, the principles of rhythm generation in plants are the same as in mammals or Drosophila, but the components involved are largely different, pointing to independent origins of the timekeeping mechanisms. In mammals, the core loop comprises the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which activate the expression of Cryptochrome and Period genes. The PERIOD/CRYPTOCHROME complex, in turn, represses BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription of their own genes. Additional feedback loops consisting of transcriptional activators and repressors interlock with this central loop to regulate the expression of the core clock genes (for a detailed description, see Zhang and Kay [8], Staiger and Köster [9], and Dibner et al. [10])., In this review, we summarize recent insights into the blueprint of the circadian clock and the function of clock proteins based on genomic studies in Arabidopsis and other plant species (Figure 2). Furthermore, we describe how large-scale biology has greatly advanced our understanding of how timing information is translated into rhythmic processes in the plant cell.

                        Arabidopsis thaliana
                        and homologs in other plant species discussed in this review. Ostreococcus tauri contains single homologs of CCA1 and TOC1, respectively [71]. The PRR ortholog PPD, most similar to PRR7, in Hordeum vulgare (PPDH1) [72] and Triticum aestivum (PPDA1, PPDB1 and PPDD1, designated after the location they derive from) [73] is important for flowering time control. The PRR7-like BvBTC1 in beet (Beta vulgaris) regulates bolting time [74]. Hordeum vulgare contains an ELF3 ortholog, EAM8 [75]. Brassica rapa retains a suite of clock genes after polyploidization and subsequent gene loss [80].
                    , Chronobiology, the discipline of endogenous timekeeping, went molecular with the first demonstration of mRNAs in pea plants that appeared at sunrise and disappeared at sunset, and continued to cycle with a 24-h rhythm even in the absence of a light-dark cycle [11]. It was difficult to appreciate these circadian experiments as they were not just a 'minus light' sample compared with a 'plus light' sample, but required processing of many samples harvested around the clock. A major advance in this sort of approach was to move beyond a gene-by-gene examination. The first circadian microarray study was opportunely performed just after the compilation of the Arabidopsis genome [12, 13]. Cycling gene clusters could thus be linked to nearby non-coding DNA, and conserved elements in the upstream regions revealed phase-specific promoter elements [12, 14–16]. These studies provided valuable insights into the genome-wide mechanism of clock outputs for the first time. Groups of genes that are co-ordinately directed to certain times of the day pointed to entire pathways that were not previously known to be clock-regulated, such as the phenylpropanoid pathway [12]., Subsequently, many homologous genes were found to be clock-regulated and phased to similar times of day in poplar and rice, as they are in Arabidopsis [17]. Furthermore, the same three major classes of cis-regulatory modules of Arabidopsis were found in poplar and rice. The morning module consists of the morning element (CCACAC), which confers expression at the beginning of the day, and a ubiquitous G-box (CACGTG) regulatory element associated with regulation by light and by the phytohormone abscisic acid. The evening module consists of the evening element (AAAATATCT), which confers expression at the end of the day, and the GATA motif, which is associated with light-regulated genes. The midnight modules come in three variants, ATGGCC (PBX), AAACCCT (TBX) and AAGCC (SBX). This points to a strong conservation of clock-regulated transcriptional networks between mono- and dicotyledonous species [17]. As shown in Figure 1c, oscillations of the output genes can be accomplished through direct binding of rhythmically expressed clock proteins to phase modules in the promoters of output genes, or via intermediate transcription factors., The information from numerous microarray experiments conducted under different light and temperature regimes by the community were assembled into the easy-to-use DIURNAL database [18]. This site is widely consulted to check for rhythmic transcript patterns, reflecting the growing awareness of the importance of temporal programs in gene expression [18]., Rhythmically expressed genes in Arabidopsis were found to be over-represented among phytohormone- and stress-responsive pathways. This revealed that endogenous or environmental cues elicit reactions of different intensities depending on the time-of-day [15, 19]. This so-called 'gating' is thought to optimize the response to a plethora of stimuli impinging on the plant, and may be of particular relevance for sessile organisms [2]. An example of this is how the PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9 proteins contribute to the cold stress response [20]. These PRRs also contribute to coordinating the timing of the tricarboxylic acid cycle [21]. In this way, one set of regulators directly link global gene expression patterns to rhythmic primary metabolism and stress signaling., A similar systems-based approach identified the circadian clock as a key player in other facets of metabolism, since CCA1 regulates a network of nitrogen-responsive genes throughout the plant [22]. CCA1 also has a role in coordination of the reactive oxygen species response that occurs each day as part of light harvesting for photosynthesis and the reaction to abiotic stress, such as the response to high salt [23]. Another clock-optimized process is the regulation of plant immunity. The defense of Arabidopsis against Pseudomonas syringae or insects depends on the time-of-day of pathogen attack [24–26]. Furthermore, genes that are induced upon infection with the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, which causes downy mildew disease, have more CCA1 binding sites in their promoters than expected [27]. cca1 mutants show reduced resistance when infected at dawn. Since lhy mutants are not impaired in disease resistance, this points to a specific effect of the CCA1 clock protein rather than a general effect of the clock [27]. Similarly, the RNA-binding protein AtGRP7 (Arabidopsis thaliana glycine-rich RNA binding protein 7), which is part of a negative feedback loop downstream of the core oscillator, plays a role in immunity [28–30]., Microarray analysis has also contributed to the question of whether there is one clock for all parts of the plant. Plants, unlike animals, do not have their circadian system organized into a master clock situated in the brain and 'slave' clocks in peripheral organs [31]. However, the differential oscillatory patterns of core clock genes in Arabidopsis shoots and roots point to a distinct clock in roots that runs only on the morning loop [32]., Soon after discovering the effect of the clock on transcription, it became apparent that clock-controlled promoter activity does not always lead to detectable oscillations in mRNA steady-state abundance. This was attributable to a long half-life of the transcripts [33]. In Arabidopsis, a global search for short-lived transcripts identified a suite of clock-controlled transcripts. For some of these, the mRNA stability changes over the circadian cycle [34]. Corresponding factors that may coordinately regulate the half-life of sets of transcripts are yet to be identified, although candidates include RNA-binding proteins that themselves undergo circadian oscillations [35]., A prominent role for post-transcriptional control in circadian timekeeping was suggested by the long period phenotype of the prmt5 mutant defective in PROTEIN ARGININE METHYLTRANSFERASE 5 [36–38]. Among the protein substrates of PRMT5 are splicing factors, and thus PRMT5 has a global impact on splicing. Alternative splicing of the clock gene PRR9 is affected by loss of PRMT5 and the transcript isoform encoding functional PRR9 is barely detectable in prmt5 mutants, suggesting that the circadian defect may partly be caused by changes in PRR9 splicing [36]. Additional splicing factors that affect circadian rhythms are SPLICEOSOMAL TIMEKEEPER LOCUS1, the SNW/Ski-interacting protein (SKIP) domain protein SKIP, and the paralogous RNA-binding proteins AtGRP7 and AtGRP8 [39–41]. Notably, AtGRP7 and AtGRP8 form a feedback loop through unproductive alternative splicing and decay of transcript isoforms with a premature termination codon, associating for the first time nonsense-mediated decay with the circadian system [42, 43]., In another approach, a high-resolution RT-PCR panel based on fluorescently labeled amplicons was used to systematically monitor alternative splicing of the core oscillator genes [44]. Alternative splicing events were observed 63 times, and of these, at least 13 were affected by low temperature. This suggested that alternative splicing might serve to adjust clock function to temperature changes. More recently, RNA-Seq analyses identified alternative splicing of many clock genes, and an event leading to the retention of an intron in CCA1 was conserved across different plant species [45]. In the future, a systematic comparison of alternative splicing networks (both for core clock genes and clock output genes) to the corresponding transcriptional programs will unravel the contribution of alternative splicing to the rhythms in transcript and protein abundance., To date, the extent to which proteins undergo circadian oscillations in the plant cell has not been systematically studied. An initial proteomic study in rice revealed a difference in expression phases between mRNAs and proteins, suggesting regulation at the post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels [46]. Uncoupling of protein rhythms from mRNA rhythms has also been observed in mouse liver, where 20% of soluble proteins show a rhythm in protein abundance but only half of them originate from rhythmic transcripts [47]., A prominent class of small noncoding RNAs are microRNAs (miRNAs), which are 19 to 22 nucleotide long single-stranded RNAs that base-pair with mRNA targets and thereby control the level of target transcripts or the level of translation of these mRNAs [48]. miRNAs that oscillate across the circadian cycle have been widely described in mammals and Drosophila. In these organisms, miRNAs target clock components and play a role in entrainment or regulation of clock output [49, 50]., In Arabidopsis, a suite of miRNAs was interrogated for rhythmic expression. Using tiling arrays, miR157A, miR158A, miR160B and miR167D were found to be clock-controlled [51]. On the other hand, miR171, miR398, miR168 and miR167 oscillate diurnally but are not controlled by the clock [52]. The functional implications of these mRNA oscillations are not yet clear. Based on the prominent role miRNAs play in modulating the circadian clock in Drosophila or mammals, such a function is to be expected in plants, where miRNAs so far have a demonstrated role only in clock output, such as seasonal timing of flowering [53]., Another class of noncoding RNAs is naturally occurring antisense transcripts (NATs). In Arabidopsis, rhythmic NATs were detected for 7% of the protein coding genes using tiling arrays [51]. Among these were the clock proteins LHY and CCA1, TOC1, PRR3, PRR5, PRR7 and PRR9. In the bread mold Neurospora crassa, NATs have been implicated in clock regulation. Suites of large antisense transcripts overlap the clock gene frequency in opposite phase to sense frq. These NATs are also induced by light and thus appear to play a role in entrainment by light signals [54]. A causal role for noncoding RNAs in the plant circadian system has yet to be established., Forward genetic screens of mutagenized plants carrying clock-controlled promoters fused to the LUCIFERASE reporter for aberrant timing of bioluminescence were instrumental to uncover the first clock genes, TOC1, ZEITLUPE and LUX/PCL1 [55–58]. Likely because of extensive redundancy in plant genomes, most other clock genes were identified by reverse genetic approaches and genome-wide studies. In fact, up to 5% of transcription factors have the capacity to contribute to proper rhythm generation [59]. A yeast one hybrid screen of a collection of transcription factors for their binding to the CCA1/LHY regulatory regions revealed CIRCADIAN HIKING EXPEDITION (CHE) as a modulator of the clock [60]., These CHE studies attempted to bridge TOC1 with the regulation of CCA1/LHY, but failed to fully explain the effect of TOC1 on CCA1/LHY expression. Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-Seq showed that TOC1 directly associates with the CCA1 promoter, and this interaction is not dependent on CHE [61, 62]. Thus, while CHE is not generally seen as a core clock component, its analysis revealed that genomic approaches can feasibly interrogate the capacity of a given transcription factor to modulate clock performance. Genome-wide analysis of cis-elements in clock-controlled promoters should identify the motifs that control rhythmic RNA expression of a clock-controlled gene, and this facilitates the identification of the trans factors that create such rhythms (Figure 1c)., ChIP-Seq revealed that PRR5 functions as a transcriptional repressor to control the timing of target genes [63]. It can be expected that the global DNA-binding activity of all core-clock components will be rapidly assembled and this will be associated with the roles of each factor in regulating global transcription, accounting for up to 30% of all transcripts [64]., Rhythmic clock gene transcription is accompanied by histone modification at the 5' ends. For example, in mammals transcriptional activity of the promoters of the Period clock genes coincides with rhythmic acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 that is dependent on the histone acetyltransferase activity of CLOCK [65]. In Arabidopsis, it was shown that acetylation of H3 at the TOC1 promoter is rhythmically regulated, and this positively correlates with TOC1 transcription [66]. Later, the chromatin of other clock genes, including CCA1, LHY, PRR9, PRR7 and LUX, was additionally found to be rhythmically modulated by multiple types of histone modification [67, 68] (Figure 3). The level of the transcription activating marks, acetylation on H3 (H3ac) and tri-methylation on H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), increases when these clock genes are actively transcribed, whereas the level of the transcription repressing marks H3K36me2 and H3K4me2 reach their peak when the genes are at their trough [67, 68]. These histone modifications are found to be dynamically controlled such that H3 is sequentially changed as H3ac→H3K4me3→H3K4me2 within a rhythmic period [68]. The level of other chromatin marks such as H4Ac, H3K27me3, H3K27me2 and H3K9me3 at the clock gene promoter region does not change rhythmically [67, 68].

                        gene expression across the day. The marks for active chromatin, H3Ac and H3K4me3 (top), sequentially correlate with peaks in clock gene mRNA accumulation (bottom), whereas the mark for repressive chromatin, H3K4me2 (top), inversely correlates with TOC1 mRNA accumulation (bottom). The open bar refers to day, the dark bar refers to night.
                    , So far, a number of clock components have been shown to be required to modify histones at the appropriate time. For example, CCA1 antagonizes H3Ac at the TOC1 promoter [66]. In contrast, REVEILLE8 (RVE8), a MYB-like transcription factor similar to CCA1 and LHY, promotes H3Ac at the TOC1 promoter, predominantly during the day [69]. However, it is unclear if CCA1 and RVE8 cause the histone modification at the TOC1 promoter, or if histone modification allows CCA1 or RVE8 to actively participate in regulation of TOC1 transcription, respectively. The underlying molecular mechanism of the temporal histone modification and components involved are currently elusive. Furthermore, it remains to be shown whether other histone modifications, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination or sumoylation [70], also contribute to the clock gene expression and change across the day., The availability of an ever-increasing number of sequenced plant genomes has made it possible to track down the evolution of core clock genes. The Arabidopsis core oscillator comprises families of proteins that are assumed to have partially redundant functions [1, 3]. The founding hypothesis was that the higher-land-plant clock derived from algae. The green alga Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest living eukaryote with its 12.5 Mb genome (10% of Arabidopsis) has only a CCA1 homolog, forming a simple two-component feedback-loop with a TOC1 homolog, the only PRR-like gene found in Ostreococcus [71]. This supported that the hypothesis that the CCA1-TOC1 cycle is the ancestral oscillator (Figure 2)., Recent efforts to clone crop-domestication genes have revealed that ancient and modern breeding has selected variants in clock components. The most notable examples include the transitions of barley and wheat as cereals and alfalfa and pea as legumes from the Fertile Crescent to temperate Europe. This breeding and seed trafficking was arguably the greatest force in Europe leading the transition from nomadic to civilized lifestyles. It is known that ancestral barley and wheat are what are now called the winter varieties. The common spring varieties arose as late flowering cultivars, which profit from the extended light and warmth of European summers over that of the Middle East. That occurred from a single mutation in barley (Hordeum vulgare) in a PRR ortholog most similar to PRR7 termed Ppd-1 (Photoperiod-1) (Figure 2) [72]. In wheat (Triticum aestivum), since it is polyploid and recessive mutations rarely have any phenotypic impact, breeders selected promoter mutations at PPD that led to dominant late-flowering [73]. Interestingly, in the beet Beta vulgaris, a PRR7-like gene named BOLTING TIME CONTROL1 (BvBTC1) is involved in the regulation of bolting time, mediating responses to both long days and vernalization [74]. Evolution at PRR7 is thus a recurrent event in plant domestication., As barley (Hordeum vulgare) moved north, early flowering was selected in a late-flowering context due to the presence of the spring allele at ppdh1. Mutations in the barley ELF3 ortholog, termed EAM8 (Figure 2), were selected [75]. Interestingly, the migration of bean and alfalfa to temperate Europe also coincided with ELF3 mutations [76]. In Asia, rice varieties in domestication have also mapped to the ELF3 locus [77]. It will be intriguing to assess the genome-wide population structure of clock gene variation as a possible driving force in species migration over latitude and altitude. Genome-wide efforts to explore this show that such studies have merit [78]., One identifying feature of plants within clades of multicellular organisms is the possibility of fertile polyploids. It is speculated that, over evolutionary time, all higher-land plants were at one time polyploid, and indeed, it has been estimated that up to 80% of extant plant species are in a non-diploid state [79]. This raises several confounding features on the genome. For one, in autopolyploids, derived from an expansion of genomes derived from one species, the process of going from 2× to 4× obviously increases the copy number of all genes by twofold. One report to examine this comes from the comparison of the Brassica rapa oscillator repertory [80]. On average, it is possible for this species to have threefold more of an individual gene over Arabidopsis. However, this is not always the case, as gene loss of these redundant copies has occurred at numerous loci [81]. By examining the probability of gene presence, it has been shown that the retention of clock genes has been more highly favored than the retention of genes randomly sampled from the genome [81]; this was not a linkage disequilibrium effect, as even the neighboring genes, as known by synteny, were retained at a lower rate. Thus, Brassica rapa has gained fitness by keeping additional copies of clock genes (Figure 2). Why that is awaits testing., In allopolyploids that arise from the intercrossing of species, the clock confronts allele choice issues between the potentially conflicting parental genomes. Allopolyploids are common in nature, are often easy to recreate in the lab, and are often more vigorous than the parents. Using a newly generated allopolyploid, the role of the clock in providing a genome-wide fitness was assessed [75, 76]. Epigenetic modification at two morning clock genes was found to associate with vigor through regulation of metabolic processes [82]. In subsequent studies, this was further related to stress response pathways in a genome-wide analysis of mRNA decay [83]. Thus, genome-wide polyploidy acts early on clock genes to partition metabolism and stress signaling., High-throughput approaches have greatly advanced our understanding of the pervasive effect of the clock on the transcriptome and molecular underpinnings of rhythms in promoter activity. However, our knowledge of rhythms in protein abundance conferred by subsequent layers of regulation and of small RNA regulation in the plant circadian system is underdeveloped. Comparative genomics among different plant species have pointed to divergences in clock-output processes, and perhaps in the clock mechanism itself. Relating the orthologous function of a given clock protein across the function of the plant genomes will undoubtedly continue to require large-scale genomics."

Clearly, the tree phenotype has evolved many times in plants. The diversity of plant structures, development, life history, environments occupied and so on in trees is nearly as broad as higher plants in general, but trees share the common characteristic that all are perennial and many are very long lived. Because of the sessile nature of plants, each tree must survive and reproduce in a specific environment over the seasonal cycles of its lifetime. This tight association between individual genotypes and their environment provides a powerful research setting, just as it has driven the evolution of a plethora of uniquely arboreal adaptations. Understanding these evolutionary strategies is a long-standing area of study of tree biologists, with many broader biological implications., Completed and current genome-sequencing projects in forest trees are limited to about 25 species from just 4 of more than 100 families: Pinaceae (pines, spruces and firs), Salicaceae (poplars and willows), Myrtaceae (eucalyptus) and Fagaceae (oaks, chestnuts and beeches). Large-scale sequencing projects such as the 1000 Human Genomes [3], 1000 Plant Genomes (1KP) [4] or the 5000 Insect Genome (i5k) [5] projects have not yet been proposed for forest trees., Genome resources are developing rapidly in forest trees in spite of the challenges associated with working with large, long-lived organisms and sometimes very large genomes [2]. Complete genome sequencing, however, has been slow to advance in forest trees owing to funding limitations and the large size of conifer genomes. Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray) was the first forest tree genome to be sequenced by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE/JGI) [6] (Table 1). Black cottonwood has a relatively small genome (450 Mb) and is a target feedstock species for cellulosic ethanol production, and thus fits into the DOE/JGI priority of sequencing bioenergy feedstock species. The genus Populus has 30+ species (aspens and cottonwoods) with genome sizes of approximately 500 Mb. Several species are being sequenced by DOE/JGI, and other groups around the world, and it seems likely that all members of the genus will soon have a genome sequence (Table 1). The next forest tree to be sequenced was the flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis BRASUZ1, which is a member of the Myrtaceae family), again by DOE/JGI. Eucalyptus species and their hybrids are important commercial species grown in their native Australia and many regions throughout the southern hemisphere. Several more eucalyptus species are being sequenced (Table 1), each with relatively small genomes (500 Mb), but it will probably take many years before all 700+ members of this genus are completed. Several members of the Fagaceae family are now being sequenced (Table 1). Members of this group include the oaks, beeches and chestnuts, with genome sizes less than 1 Gb.Table 1

                  , The gymnosperm forest trees (such as the conifers) were the last to enter the world of genome sequencing. This was entirely due to their very large genomes (10 Gb and greater) as they are extremely important economically and ecologically, and phylogenetically they represent the ancient sister lineage to that of angiosperm species. Genome resources needed to support a sequencing project were reasonably well developed, but it was not until the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that sequencing conifer genomes became tractable. Currently, there are at least ten conifer (Pinaceae) genome-sequencing projects under way (Table 1)., Aside from reference genome sequencing in forest trees, there is significant activity in transcriptome sequencing and resequencing for polymorphism discovery (Tables 2 and 3). We have only listed the transcriptome and resequencing projects in Table 1 that are associated with a species that has an active genome-sequencing project.Table 2

                  , The power of comparative-genomic approaches for understanding function in an evolutionary framework is well established [7–13]. Comparative genomics can be applied to sequence data (nucleotide and protein) at the level of individual genes or genome-wide. Genome-wide approaches provide insight into both chromosome evolution and the diversification of biological functions and interactions., Understanding of gene function in forest tree species is challenged by the lack of standard reverse-genetic tools routinely used in other systems - for example, standard marker stocks, facile transformation and regeneration - and by the long generation times. Thus, comparative genomics becomes the more powerful approach to understanding gene function in trees., Comparative genomics requires not only data availability but also cyber-infrastructure to support exchange and analysis. The TreeGenes database is the most comprehensive resource for comparative-genomic analyses in forest trees [14]. Several smaller databases have been created to facilitate collaborations, including: Fagaceae genomics web, hardwoodgenomics.org, Quercus portal, PineDB, ConiferGDB, EuroPineDB, PopulusDB, PoplarDB, EucalyptusDB and Eucanext (Tables 1, 2, and 3). These resources vary greatly in their scope, relevance and integration. Some are static and archival, whereas others focus on current sequence content for a specific species or a small number of related species. This results in overlapping and conflicting data among repositories. In addition, each database uses its own custom interfaces and back-end database technology to serve sequence to the user. The US National Science Foundation funding for large-scale infrastructure projects, such as iPlant, is leading efforts aimed towards centralizing resources for research communities [15]. Without centralized resources, researchers are forced to employ inefficient data-mining methods through queries of independently maintained databases or inconsistently formatted supplemental files on journal websites. Specific areas of interest for the forest tree genomic community include the ability to connect sequence, genotype and phenotype to individual, geo-referenced trees. This type of integration can only be achieved through web services that allow disparate resources to communicate in ways that are transparent to the user [16]. With the recent increase of genome sequences available for many of these species, there is a need to facilitate community-level annotation and research support., The Human Genome Project established a culture of open access and data sharing in genomics research for both humans and animal models that has been extended to many other species, including Arabidopsis, rat, cow, dog, rice, maize and more than 500 other eukaryotes. Beginning in the late 1990s, these large-scale projects released data very rapidly to the scientific community, often years before publication. This rapid release of data with few restrictions has allowed thousands of scientists to begin work on specific genes and gene families, and on functional studies, long before the genome papers have appeared. One of the driving motivations for this culture, and the reason that many scientists support it, is that large-scale sequencing can be done most efficiently when centers that have expertise in sequencing technology take the lead. With all the sequencing concentrated, the body of data needs to be shared freely in order to get it in the hands of the widely distributed experts. This open-access culture has dramatically accelerated scientific progress in biological research., Research priorities in forest tree genomics identified in earlier Opinion papers., From Neale and Ingvarsson [1]:,

A whole-genome approach to flower evolution will help our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions., The influence of pollinator choice on the evolution of various sensory cues displayed by flowers is well documented (for example, [11–17, 51]; Figure 1). Genetic analyses of plant-pollinator interactions can be roughly divided into studies that document candidate genes and quantify pollinator response to manipulation, those that explore genetic pathways and mechanisms of floral traits [52] and studies that seek to understand the evolutionary history of species interactions, such as adaptive radiations of plants and their pollinators [53].

                        Interactions of different plants and pollinators; genomes are indicated symbolically. Left to right: the hummingbird-pollinated Aquilegia formosa, the bee-pollinated Ipomea pes-caprae, the moth-pollinated Silene latifolia and the sexual mimic Ophrys exaltata with its pollinator, a male Colletes cunicularius bee. Many of these affinities are neither fixed nor exclusive, as indicated by dashed diagonal arrows. Arrows between the chromosomes symbolize the many interactions of different loci distributed among the genomes, mediated by the phenotypes of plants and pollinators. Genomic approaches will probably lead to a better understanding of how interactions influence the evolution of molecular traits and their variability. The scent molecules β-ocimene, lilac aldehyde and (Z)-7-pentacosene (from left to right) are representative examples of the respective pollination systems bee pollination, moth pollination and sexual mimicry.

                    , Floral traits are sometimes controlled by a relatively small number of genes [54]. For example, in the common morning glory (Ipomoea purpurea), various aspects of pigmentation are controlled by single loci [55]: one locus determines pink versus blue flowers, another controls intensity, a third controls the patterning and degree of pigmentation, and a fourth locus has epistatic effects on the other three loci [56–58]. Pollinator selection for specific loci has been tested in various contexts. For example, red flowers are relatively poorly detected by insect pollinators that lack red receptors [59], whereas hummingbirds have such receptors and can thus detect and identify red flowers more easily [13, 60, 61]. In cases in which flower color is controlled by a small number of loci, crossing experiments can directly assess pollinator responses to a specific allele (Figure 1, 2). Among monkeyflowers, the predominantly hummingbird-pollinated species Mimulus cardinalis is orange and the typically bee-pollinated M. lewisii is pink. The difference in coloration is governed by variation at a single locus (YUP), which controls presence/absence of carotenoids in the petals. Substituting the YUP allele in each species with its counterpart from the other species (while leaving all other floral traits, including morphology, unaffected) caused hummingbirds to prefer M. lewisii flowers with altered (""bird-flower-like"", orange) pigmentation over wild-type flowers (which they rarely visited). Bumblebees, conversely, visited M. cardinalis more frequently than wild-type flowers if the flowers had M. lewisii-like pigmentation, showing that a single major mutation affecting flower color may generate a profound shift in pollinator spectrum [59, 62]. Genomic methods such as sRAD or homologous gene sequencing from target loci can be used to compare genotypes between individuals, species and so on within radiations in the search of genotypes (such as SNPs) that segregate with particular phenotypes.

(a) Interspecific hybridization can generate a large range of characters in hybrids, including intermediate characters and potentially characters that fall outside the range found in the parents (transgressive characters). Hybrids usually backcross to one or both of the parents, providing gene flow between species. Herbivores and/or pollinators may select for particular combinations of characters. (b) F1 and F2 hybrids between bee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii and predominantly hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis. In F2 the different flowers show a range of intermediate characters.

                    , It is important to emphasize, however, that studies on pollinator 'attraction' or 'preference' for certain floral phenotypes should not be conducted in field conditions, because the preferred type of flower will most likely just be the one that is most similar to those experienced by the pollinators before the start of the experiment. For this reason, it is necessary to experiment with laboratory-reared pollinators that have no previous exposure to natural flowers before a preference test begins [63]. Using this approach on wild-type snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus) and various mutants that affect flower visual appearance and morphology, it has been possible to disentangle how visitation frequencies of various flower types emerge as a complex interplay between pollinator innate bias, flower detectability and learned preference [10, 64]., Although many floral traits are controlled by a single locus, many more are multi-locus traits. Some floral scent cues that influence pollinators may be affected by a relatively small number of genetic loci, detected by screening for QTLs. For example, some floral traits in Petunia species are controlled by several loci of relatively large effect. F2 plants from crosses between P. axillaris (which produces scent cues) with P. exserta (which has no scent) led to the identification of two QTLs, one on chromosome II and another on chromosome VII, that together explained 60% of the variation in the production of benzenoid volatiles between the two species [65]. QTLs can, of course, correspond with large genetic intervals containing tens or even hundreds of genes, and so it is important to pinpoint the exact genes (and their number) to understand the ease with which an evolutionary transition between, for example, a scented and a scentless flower type can occur. To do that, the authors [65] developed introgression lines for high resolution mapping and localized one gene, ODORANT1, which encodes a MYB-type transcription factor that mapped to the QTL on chromosome VII. The breeding lines were then used to demonstrate that hawkmoths prefer scented plants, particularly when given choices between plants spaced over short distances [65]. QTLs have also been associated with many other aspects of pollination syndromes in P. axillaris (pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths) and P. integrifolia (pollinated by diurnal bees), including corolla length, nectar volume, style/stamen arrangement and fragrance [66]., Many traits show continuous phenotypic distributions and environmental interactions, with examples in the shape and size of petals, corolla tubes, stamens and pistils, as well as placement and arrangement of anthers and stamens, nectar volume, and the number of ovules and pollen grains [67]. Frequently, traits are controlled not by a single or a few genes, but by multiple genes across the genome, each with small effects. To detect the causes and consequences of these effects, the genome of Petunia will be very useful because molecular markers (for example SNPs) can be mapped to the scaffold for GWAS studies. NGS approaches, analyzing many thousands of short sequences from across the genome or from the transcriptome, offer huge potential for GS, because they enable phenotype prediction by examining the combination of genetic markers that most strongly correlates with phenotype [28, 31]. The method requires finding associations between genome-wide markers and a trait of interest in a population of individuals with known phenotype and then applying the derived knowledge to predict phenotype in new individuals [28]. The approach has already proved successful in enhancing milk production in cows, and lines have been adopted by the dairy industry worldwide [31], although the statistical approaches are currently limited to analyses of markers in populations of highly related individuals. For pollinator-floral evolution questions, the future will require analyses of more divergent populations, and for this the statistics will need to be extended., In some cases, small genetic changes controlling floral traits not only generate a shift in the principal pollinators that visit the flowers, but also in the unwanted visitors, such as nectar-thieving ants [20]. In addition to sugars, which constitute the principal reward in most floral nectar, many other substances are also found in nectar. Bitter substances, such as caffeine or nicotine, repel visitors at high concentrations, but at low concentrations can be attractive [68] and indeed have beneficial effects on pollinator learning and memory for floral traits [69]. Different flower visitors can vary in their response thresholds for the repellent effect; for example, in Nicotiana attenuata flowers, moths responded more strongly to the presence of nicotine (repulsion) and benzyl acetone (attraction) in nectar than hummingbirds [20]. RNA interference on only two loci can block the production of both benzyl acetone and nicotine, resulting in fewer visits and nectar removal by pollinators, which has fitness effects (for example, altering seed set), but it also alters damage by herbivores, and nectar theft by ants [51]. This provides an example of how complex the interactions between selection and genetic associations can be in relationships between plants, pollinators and antagonists such as herbivores [67]., Beyond isolating floral mechanisms affecting pollinator behavior, genetic analysis provides a molecular phylogenetic context for the evaluation of correlated divergence between plants and their pollinators, as well as the demographic changes of populations. One of the earliest phylogeographic studies involved restriction site mapping and length polymorphism analysis of the honeybee Apis mellifera [70]. Phylogenetic perspectives using both genetic and genomic information serve to clarify the origin of particular traits (for example, [71]) as well as the timing of adaptive radiation. It is these radiations that may allow inter- and intraspecific comparisons, particularly with respect to closely related out-groups with different phenotypes., When considering the consequences of interactions between angiosperms and their pollinators, it is vital to consider two predominant processes influencing angiosperm diversity: interspecific hybridization and polyploidy (or whole-genome multiplication; Figure 2). At least 25% of species form interspecific hybrids [72], resulting in introgression of characters between species and, rarely, the formation of homoploid hybrid taxa [24]. This process results in complex, reticulate patterns of evolution in many angiosperm groups, making it difficult or impossible to circumscribe species boundaries. In addition, polyploidy is widespread and is thought to have influenced all angiosperms, having occurred at the base of both the seed plants and angiosperms [73] and within most lineages thereafter, sometimes surprisingly frequently. For example, the apparently diploid species A. thaliana, a model species because of its small genome, has undergone three rounds of polyploidization since the divergence of angiosperms [74, 75], and the existence of natural cultivars with double the expected number of chromosomes reveal that the process is ongoing. Indeed, an analysis of chromosome counts across multiple genera led Wood et al. [76] to predict that polyploidy accounts for 15% of angiosperm speciation events. Furthermore, many polyploids form in association with interspecific hybridization (allopolyploidy [77, 78])., A consequence of such a high prevalence of interspecific hybridization and polyploidy in the ancestry of angiosperms is that much diversity is generated. Recent advances in NGS approaches, including RNA-seq, reveal that these evolutionary processes can affect the genome and transcriptome, which in turn must govern changes to the metabolome and phenotype [74]. At the genome level, there is much variation in the outcome of allopolyploidy, from considerable genomic restructuring, even between progeny of the same cross, or little at all, depending on the example [74]. At the level of the transcriptome, there can be large-scale changes in both the nature (which genes are expressed) and in the total amount of RNA expressed [79] per cell, the significance of which is yet to be understood. Recurrent polyploidy in angiosperm evolution has also resulted in the evolution of genes in large multigene families [80]. With the evolution of gene duplicates, there can be relaxed selection on one of the gene copies, enabling it to diverge, potentially to acquire new functions. This can lead to individual gene members of the family having different metabolic roles, as observed through their differing patterns of gene expression [79]. For example, gene duplicates of anthocyanin-regulating transcription factors in Mimulus from Chile have evolved independently in separate tetraploid lineages to generate red floral pigmentation in flower lobes [81]. Interspecific hybridization and allopolyploidy provide the opportunity for new, transgressive characters to evolve. Transgressive characters [24] can be observed at all levels from the transcriptome to inflorescence morphology [79, 82] and may arise through novel cis-trans interactions in the genome [83] or by 'mixing and matching' of different metabolic pathways found in the parents., An example in which gene duplication has led to the evolution of a large plant gene family with key functions in plant-insect interactions is seen in the terpenoid synthase genes, encoding enzymes that synthesize volatile compounds called terpenoids that mediate interactions with mutualists and antagonists [84]. Minor structural changes in terpenoid synthase genes are known to change the product of the encoded enzymes, allowing rapid evolutionary change in volatile compounds [85]. Another example is the desaturase genes, which encode key compounds for pollinator attraction in the highly specific sexual mimicry systems in orchids of the genus Ophrys [18, 86]. Ophrys species have large, variable families of desaturase genes with high allele diversity and species-specific expression patterns. Variation in structural genes, as well as changes in their expression levels, are likely mechanisms allowing rapid evolutionary responses to fluctuating pollinator communities. A major challenge for understanding the link between genotypic and phenotypic variation, however, is the functional characterization of gene copies and different alleles [18, 87] and their respective roles in determining key traits in plant-insect interactions. This approach will require methods and statistics to be developed from GS studies to diverse natural situations, enabling the characterization of multiple genes with small effects, as already discussed., Although the term 'genomic' tends to imply the analysis of entire genomes and genome assembly, genomic methods themselves can be applied to other practical aspects of pollinator-plant interactions [40]. Molecular methods of documenting species interactions began with traditional immunological and genetic methods (reviewed in [88]) but progressed to genomic methodologies, in particular NGS (reviewed in [89]). One approach is to use NGS to amplify millions of homologous sequences from a target gene from DNA extracted from a mixed biomass and compare the resulting sequences with curated databases of sequences of known origin (for example, [90, 91]) in a 'food forensics' approach [92]. The use of genomic sequencing platforms (such as Illumina, Roche 454 and Ion Torrent) for fragment analysis is one of the most common techniques. This approach enables diagnosis of specific and hard-to-observe interactions (such as nocturnal pollination) using targeted gene amplification in the context of 'ecological genomics' (Figure 3).

                        A schematic of genomic methods as applied to document plant-pollinator interactions. The development of high-throughput sequencing platforms for genome analysis coupled with the establishment of public databases of standardized marker regions for the express purpose of taxonomic identification (for example, BOLDSYSTEMS [111] and the National Center for Biotechnology Information [112]) has enabled the development of a branch of ecological genomics devoted to documentation of species interactions. An unobserved flower visitation event can be conclusively demonstrated by sequencing plant markers from the mixed pollen sample carried by the pollinator (either in the gut or on the animal). The resulting markers can be compared with public or private collections of taxonomically validated references for species-level documentation of the ecological event. This enables large-scale measurements of species' interactions to be largely automated. The resulting databases can be used to quantitatively measure a variety of ecologically and evolutionarily important events, such as the relative specialization or generalization of specific plant-animal pairs, the selection pressure of one group of species on another, the economic impact of a particular ecosystem service (for example, pollination of a particular crop of interest) or the response of an ecological system to disruption.

                    , The goal of these analyses is to accurately diagnose species-level interactions that cannot easily be documented in the wild. The most recent investigations have focused on predator-prey or herbivorous interactions rather than mutualistic interactions, in part because reference taxonomic databases of molecular information for animals have developed faster than those for plants. Interactions among species form the basis of ecosystem functioning and underlie evolutionary and ecological principles of conservation biology. However, directly measuring biological diversity is much simpler than characterizing the interactions between taxa [93]. These relationships between species form the building blocks of food webs, and exploring the mechanisms structuring these interaction patterns is crucial in understanding their spatial-temporal variation and predicting their responses to disturbance. Knowing precisely which pollinators visit which plants in the wild is also vital to our measurements of selection, particularly when trying to clarify whether a particular pollinator is a true specialist or whether their behavior is flexible., We expect there to be swift progress in this field since a plant barcoding community consortium [94] proposed that a combination of genomic regions (including the plastid regions rbcL and matK) should be used as the core barcode for land plants, to be supplemented by the plastid intergenic spacer trnH-psbA or the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS). The final selection of a standard plant barcode is leading to the rapid acquisition of databases of plant barcodes for taxonomic and biodiversity analysis (Box 1). The application of these databases to study mutualistic interactions between plants and animals is, however, in its infancy. In Hawaiian solitary bees, molecular identification of the pollen carried (using the ITS region) linked these grains to the local flora and revealed preferential foraging for pollen from native species [95]. Similar extensions using trnL and other official plant barcode genes for the study of plant-animal interactions are under way by several research groups ([96, 97], and the authors) with the potential to rapidly diagnose thousands of individual pollination events simultaneously without the need for laborious morphological identification of pollen (Figure 3)., The accumulation of complete genome sequences is increasing quickly providing larger numbers of genome scaffolds (reference genomes) for the assembly of related taxa, an approach that will be exploited for our understanding of non-model species. As an example, the genome of the honeybee A. mellifera has been sequenced and is available as version 4 (about 236 megabases with 7.5X coverage, N50 contig = 41 kb, N50 scaffolds = 362 kb) [19]. A survey of this genome revealed a higher than expected number of odor receptor genes and novel genes for nectar and pollen utilization, as well as more loci involved in learning and memory than have been observed in Drosophila [19]. The number of olfactory receptor genes is more than twice as high as in other insects that have been examined, perhaps reflecting the importance of pheromones in the orchestration of social organization in honeybees but also underpinning the sophisticated olfactory learning abilities that bees show in floral visitation. Olfactory cues are also potentially important to bat pollinators [98]. Olfactory receptors show substantial divergence in bats compared with other terrestrial mammals [99], although this is seen in both pollinating and non-pollinating species., There are also significant phylogenetic insights that emerged from the honeybee genome, and comparison with other insect genomes. A survey of 185 genes from sequenced insect genomes suggests that the Hymenoptera share a common ancestor with all other holometabolous insects (beetles, moths and flies) [71]. These authors propose [71] that previous phylogenetic hypotheses, in which this arrangement was not recovered, were based on poorly resolved analyses based on single loci or small numbers of loci. The split between Hymenoptera and other holometabolous insects is estimated to have occurred nearly 300 million years ago [71]. It is likely that no study of any single or small number of genes could reliably reveal this ancestral relationship. Only the analysis of dozens of protein alignments derived from genome-level scans provides sufficient support to resolve the relationship. Well resolved phylogenies, particularly depicting ancient branching points, allow better characterization of evolutionary pressures involved in adaptive radiations, demographic shifts and major leaps in phenotypic evolution. This is particularly true when there is convincing evidence that diversification may be based, at least in part, on the selective pressure of two (or more) species involved in a mutualistic relationship., The genomes of several insect-pollinated plant species have now been sequenced or are currently being sequenced (see [38–42] and [100–103]). An interesting model for studying the genomics of adaptive divergence is the genus Mimulus. Sequences of the whole genome and of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of Mimulus guttatus (version 1.0 early release: about 322 Mb arranged in 2,216 scaffolds, about 301 Mb arranged in 17,831 contigs, N50 scaffold = 81, N50 contig = 1,770) are being assembled and are now available for browsing on the Phytozome website [42], containing approximately 321.7 Mb assembled (of 362 Mb [104], arranged in 2,216 scaffolds). There are extensive genetic resources for Mimulus, including ESTs, polymorphic markers, linkage maps, bacterial artificial chromosome libraries, seed stock and centralized repositories of this information for public use ([105], reviewed in [106]). Mimulus is a model system for studying adaptive phenotypic traits by analysis of pollinator selection, as it contains extensive phenotypic and genomic variation explored in both laboratory and field contexts. Furthermore, the potential for hybridization between species forms a continuum from high compatibility to reproductive isolation (reviewed in [106]), enabling the examination of interactions between floral traits and reproductive barriers. Although model species allow an understanding of evolutionary mechanisms of one particular system in detail, important insights will be gained by comparative approaches spanning the diversity of different plant-pollinator systems. This promises insights into animal sensory systems, floral signals and morphology that may co-evolve or be shaped by pre-existing biases [6]. The availability of powerful sequencing and bioinformatics tools will allow us to study non-model systems, including those with very large genomes, allowing insights through comparative approaches [66, 100–103]., One obvious next step is to ask questions about parallel phenotypic diversification. Genome studies have the potential to uncover whether parallel phenotypic changes are caused by similar underlying genomic architecture (for example, parallel phenotypes associated with homologous genes and mutations), or achieved through many alternative genetic mechanisms [27]. The exploration of parallel cases of divergence increases statistical power because evolutionary trends can be examined in replicate [27] and genomic approaches will add more dimensions through the analysis of hundreds or thousands of candidate genes and co-adapted gene complexes. Floral phenotypes are sometimes characterized by phylogenetically convergent adaptations to the requirements and preferences of certain groups of pollinators (pollination syndromes); for example, bat-pollinated flowers from multiple lineages often contain certain sulfuric components in their scent, to which bats seem to be innately attracted [98]. There are also differences in the color perception of different classes of pollinators, such as with respect to differences in red sensitivity between bees and hummingbirds (see above) [61, 107]. Convergence in regulatory mechanisms was discovered for switches in floral color from blue pigmentation in bee-pollinated flowers to red pigmentation in principally hummingbird-visited flowers [108]., We expect further genomics studies to yield insights into timing and sequence of convergent evolutionary processes, allowing us to address the long-standing question as to whether some species act as 'models' that drive selection for phenotypic similarities in other (mimic) species [6]. As in the honeybee phylogenetic example [71], thousands of loci increase the chance that true phylogenetic signal will overcome stochastic noise from loci with complicated selective histories. The exploration of convergence will provide novel insights into phylogenetic tracking as pollinators and plants co-diversify. This is particularly powerful when comparisons are made with a close relative that does not share the trait of interest (an outgroup) that can provide a basis to study adaptive evolution. Better phylogenetic resolution of deep branching structure in combination with an understanding of the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity and divergence will be a powerful tool., The existence of convergent solutions in floral evolution can involve considerable underlying genetic architectural variation (many routes to a solution), as suggested for replicate adaptive radiations [27]. There can be a surprising amount of genomic variation in natural populations on which natural selection may act [109], and one principal goal must be to quantify such variation for more species and populations. Plant-pollinator interactions are a perfect example of cases in which rapid adaptive radiations in both plant phenotype and pollinator choice set up parallel selective regimes. These are fundamental questions that can be addressed only by the comparison of genomes from parallel radiations of interacting species, which represent evolutionary replicates., DNA (or molecular) barcoding can broadly refer to any system whereby genomic data are used to assist in, or as a surrogate for, systematic identification of living organisms. Such methods were first applied in organismal groups that present great difficulties for traditional taxonomic approaches because of their microscopic size, such as Plasmodium parasites [113] or soil nematodes [114]. These cases showed the possibility of using short DNA sequences to essentially substitute for morphological identification, as sequences may be clustered into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and used as a fast and practical means to identify strains or assess diversity. DNA barcoding was later proposed as a more formalized system [90] for linking sequence data to species identifications using standardized protocols. Barcoding in this strict sense uses a small number of universal marker genes (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) for animals, ITS for fungi, rbcL, matK and trnH-psbA or ITS for plants) and a single reference data repository, BOLD [111], in which sequence data are associated with validated taxonomic identifications. Among the advantages of this system are that a DNA sequence from any unknown (obtainable from fragmentary tissue samples, pollen grains, seed fragments, hair, feces, and so on) can be readily assigned to a species or other level of identification by matching against this database."

However, little is known about signals and targets down-stream of NARK. To find NARK-related transcriptional changes in mycorrhizal soybean (Glycine max) plants, we analyzed wild-type and two nark mutant lines interacting with the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Rhizophagus irregularis., Affymetrix GeneChip analysis of non-inoculated and partially inoculated plants in a split-root system identified genes with potential regulation by arbuscular mycorrhiza or NARK. Most transcriptional changes occur locally during arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis and independently of NARK. RT-qPCR analysis verified nine genes as NARK-dependently regulated. Most of them have lower expression in roots or shoots of wild type compared to nark mutants, including genes encoding the receptor kinase GmSIK1, proteins with putative function as ornithine acetyl transferase, and a DEAD box RNA helicase. A predicted annexin named GmAnnx1a is differentially regulated by NARK and arbuscular mycorrhiza in distinct plant organs. Two putative CCAAT-binding transcription factor genes named GmNF-YA1a and GmNF-YA1b are down-regulated NARK-dependently in non-infected roots of mycorrhizal wild-type plants and functional gene analysis confirmed a positive role for these genes in the development of an arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis., Our results indicate GmNF-YA1a/b as positive regulators in arbuscular mycorrhiza establishment, whose expression is down-regulated by NARK in the autoregulated root tissue thereby diminishing subsequent infections.

The arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis, an interaction of plants with fungi of the phylum Glomeromycota [1], probably co-evolved with the early land plants around 450 million years ago (for overview see [2]). Nowadays, the majority of land plants can form an AM symbiosis that is characterized by the exchange of phosphate against monosaccharides [3]. Moreover, mycorrhizal plants can also benefit from improved availability of other minerals and water, and from induced abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, all contributing to higher plant biodiversity and productivity of ecosystems [4]. AM fungi are obligate biotrophs colonizing the root cortex of plants where they can form, depending on the plant and fungal species, inter- and intracellular hyphae, highly branched intracellular hyphae called arbuscules and/or intracellular hyphal coils, and vesicles that serve as storage organs (for overview see [5])., In addition to the wide-spread AM interaction, a few plant families including leguminous and actinorhizal plants have evolved the capability to interact with nitrogen-fixing bacteria like rhizobia and Frankia, respectively. The bacterial symbionts are hosted intracellularly in specialized organs called root nodules. Studies on plant genes involved in the establishment of these intracellular root-microbe symbioses indicated a common evolutionary origin. This led to the assumption that genes involved in the AM symbiosis might have been recruited to allow the interaction with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (for review see [6–9])., In leguminous plants, a whole set of genes are known to be essential to successfully establish the AM symbiosis and the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, referred to here as nodulation (for review see [7–10]). Establishment of both endosymbioses is initiated by an intense signal exchange between the partners. Nod and Myc factors contain lipochitooligosaccharide signals that are perceived by plant receptor kinases (RKs): in the case of nodulation by LysM RK(s) and in the case of an AM symbiosis by a still unknown receptor, which somehow interacts with the Nod factor receptor complex [11]. The signals are further processed by an early common signaling pathway including a plasma membrane-bound leucine rich repeat (LRR) RK that was found to be also essential for actinorhiza formation (for review see [7]). Activation of nuclear cation channels and induction of nucleoporin(-related) proteins are involved in generating specific oscillations of the Ca2+ concentrations in the nucleoplasm and perinuclear cytoplasm in both, AM and nodulation. In both symbioses, the Ca2+ signal is translated by a Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) that activates in interaction with other proteins specific transcription factors (TFs) (for overview see [8–10])., To reduce carbon losses and to maintain the mutualistic character of the symbioses, the plant tightly controls the infection with both heterotrophic endosymbionts. One common regulatory mechanism that limits the number of successful infection events is called autoregulation (autoregulation of nodulation (AON); autoregulation of mycorrhization (AOM)) (for review see [12–16]). The general autoregulation system of legumes comprises systemic and long-distance feedback inhibition initiated by early signals of the plant-microbe interaction suppressing subsequent infections. The key signal mediator of autoregulation is a CLAVATA1 (CLV1)-like RK, hereafter referred to as NARK (Nodulation Autoregulation Receptor Kinase) [17]. Grafting and split-root experiments revealed that NARK acts in the shoot, limiting infections systemically in the entire root system [18, 19]. Mutant plants with defective NARK are characterized by a supernodulating phenotype and a nitrate- and acid-tolerant nodulation [20, 21] and can also exhibit increased mycorrhizal colonization and higher arbuscule abundance [22–25]. However, in the AM symbiosis, the effect of autoregulation in the wild-type is often less obvious, because the fungus can spread longitudinally within the root cortex without forming new infections once it has entered the root. Nevertheless, the autoregulation effect becomes apparent in split-root plants in which colonization caused by previous and subsequent infections can be distinguished [26, 27]., Nod factor application and cross-infections with rhizobia and AM fungi demonstrated initiation of the general autoregulation system by common early signals [28]. Corresponding to the Arabidopsis thaliana CLV system, CLE peptides are suggested as root-derived signals activating NARK in the shoot (for review see [14, 15]). However, AM-induced CLEs are so far not described. The shoot-derived inhibitor (SDI), acting downstream of NARK in AON, has been characterized biochemically as a heat-stable, ethanol-soluble, low-molecular weight molecule which is unlikely an RNA or protein [29, 30]. A putative receptor of SDI in the root might be encoded by TML [31]. NARK is described to affect phytohormone balances including reduction of the shoot-to-root auxin transport and of jasmonic acid biosynthesis in the shoot [32–34]. Recently, it was shown that NARK also affects the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway via regulation of GmUFD1a [35]., Although AON and AOM share common elements, not all nark mutants characterized by supernodulation exhibit an equivalent lack of AOM [36]. This indicates the existence of additional factors that are specific in controlling the establishment of both endosymbioses. In the present study, transcriptional changes occurring during mycorrhization in soybean (Glycine max) plants were investigated. To find NARK-regulated genes involved in AOM, we performed Affymetrix GeneChip analyses with split-root plants of Bragg wild-type and nark mutants partially inoculated with the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Selected NARK-regulated, AM-dependent and AM-independent, genes were verified using RT-qPCR. Among these genes, we identified two putative CCAAT-binding TF subunits, named GmNF-YA1a and GmNF-YA1b, that were downregulated by NARK in an AM-dependent manner. The CCAAT sequence is one of the most common cis-acting elements and was found in approximately 30% of 502 eukaryotic promoters [37] (for overview see [38–40]). In higher eukaryotes, CCAAT-boxes are found in all types of promoters, including constitutively expressed and inducible promoters. Proteins that bind to the CCAAT-box or to the inverted box have been characterized inter alia for mammals, yeast, filamentous fungi, and plants, and include proteins of the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) family. DNA binding activities of NF-Ys, which are also called CBFs (CCAAT-binding factors) or HAPs (heme activating proteins), require a high conservation of the five nucleotides. NF-Ys usually act as heterotrimers. Two of the subunits (NF-YB, NF-YC/CBF-A, CBF-C/HAP3, HAP5) form a stable heterodimer, which can then interact with the third subunit (NF-YA/CBF-B/HAP2) allowing binding to the promoter region. In case of yeast, an additional acid subunit, HAP4, activates the HAP2,3,5 complex. In plants, NF-Ys can function in diverse processes (for overview see [41, 42]) and a few NF-Y subunits have previously found to be upregulated during root endosymbioses [43–53]. Though, no NF-YA subunit that is involved in AM symbiosis or suppressed during root symbioses has been described so far., Overall, our gene expression analysis in split-root experiments provides for the first time insights into transcriptional regulation by NARK during the autoregulation of arbuscular mycorrhization - a systemic regulatory mechanism controlling the most widespread and ancient interaction between vascular terrestrial plants and microbes. By RT-qPCR analysis of plant material of independent experiments, we verified nine genes to be regulated by NARK. Gene expression of annexins indicate putative involvement in AM establishment and possibly also in regulation of AM. Furthermore, we identified NF-YA genes regulated during AM, including two NARK-regulated ones named GmNYA1a and GmNYA1b. So far, no information on a role of NF-YAs during AM symbiosis or autoregulation was available. By our transcript and functional gene analysis, we designate the newly identified TF subunits GmNF-YA1a/b as positive regulators of mycorrhization, which might act as targets for NARK-mediated AOM to restrict new infections events., How GmNF-YA1a/b promote AM, however, is still unclear. A stimulation of AM formation by GmNF-YA1a/b might either be done by promoting gene expression of one of the elements of the (common) early signaling cascade or by stimulating the production of root exudates that attract AM fungi (Figure 8). Previous studies on M. sativa split-root plants showed that inoculation with the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae suppresses the production of some isoflavonoids including ononin in autoregulated root-parts [87]. In turn, application of ononin to autoregulated root-parts enhanced the colonization of such roots with F. mosseae [87]. It is tempting to speculate that GmNF-YA1a/b activates transcription of isoflavonoid biosynthesis genes. Another possible function comprises the interaction of GmNF-YA1a/b with Myc factor- or AM-induced NF-Y subunit(s) to drive gene expression that is required for successful AM fungal infection. Next to the induction of gene expression, however, NF-Y TFs can also repress transcription. Thus, GmNF-YA1a/b might potentially suppress gene expression that in return inhibit AM establishment. However, details of GmNF-YA1a/b function in establishment and regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis and a possible function of GmNF-YA1a/b in nodulation will be the focus of future work. Our findings presented here indicate a new function of NF-YAs in the regulation of plant-microbe interactions, probably by supporting the early signal exchange between both partners.

Root exudates induce production of microbial signals (Myc/Nod factors) that are perceived by symbiosis-specific plasma membrane-bound receptor kinases (RKs). The signal is then translocated to the nucleus via activation of the common early signaling cascade finally leading to the induction of specific TFs that mediate successful mycorrhization or nodulation. Additionally, the so-called activated state of the root is induced resulting most likely in production of CLE peptides as putative root-derived signals activating NARK in the shoot. NARK reduces, probably via the shoot-derived inhibitor SDI, shoot-to-root auxin transport and JA biosynthesis in the shoot. Downstream of NARK unknown components finally suppress the common early signaling cascade leading to reduced subsequent infections with AM fungi and rhizobia. (b) Proposed model of GmNF-YA1a/b function in establishment and autoregulation in AM symbiosis. GmNF-YA1a/b promote formation of AM either via stimulating production of root exudates attracting AM fungi or by acting as positive regulator of one of the components of the early signal transduction cascade of AM establishment. After AM fungal infection, in soybean plants with functional NARK the gene expression of GmNF-YA1a/b is systemically downregulated in roots. This might be caused directly by SDI or by other signals downstream of SDI.

                  Nicotiana sylvestris and Nicotiana tomentosiformis are members of the Solanaceae family that includes tomato, potato, eggplant and pepper. These two Nicotiana species originate from South America and exhibit different alkaloid and diterpenoid production. N. sylvestris is cultivated largely as an ornamental plant and it has been used as a diploid model system for studies of terpenoid production, plastid engineering, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis are considered to be modern descendants of the maternal and paternal donors that formed Nicotiana tabacum about 200,000 years ago through interspecific hybridization. Here we report the first genome-wide analysis of these two Nicotiana species., Draft genomes of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis were assembled to 82.9% and 71.6% of their expected size respectively, with N50 sizes of about 80 kb. The repeat content was 72-75%, with a higher proportion of retrotransposons and copia-like long terminal repeats in N. tomentosiformis. The transcriptome assemblies showed that 44,000-53,000 transcripts were expressed in the roots, leaves or flowers. The key genes involved in terpenoid metabolism, alkaloid metabolism and heavy metal transport showed differential expression in the leaves, roots and flowers of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis., The reference genomes of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis represent a significant contribution to the SOL100 initiative because, as members of the Nicotiana genus of Solanaceae, they strengthen the value of the already existing resources by providing additional comparative information, thereby helping to improve our understanding of plant metabolism and evolution.","","Woodland tobacco (Nicotiana sylvestris) grows naturally in the Andes from Bolivia to Argentina and is largely cultivated nowadays as an ornamental plant. Nicotiana tomentosiformis also grows naturally in the Andes but over a wider range, from Peru to Argentina [1]. N. sylvestris (2n = 24) and N. tomentosiformis (2n = 24) belong to clades of the Nicotiana sections Sylvestres and Tomentosae, respectively, of the Solanaceae family, which have diverged about 15 million years ago [2]. Other members of this family include many agriculturally important species such as tomato, potato, eggplant and pepper. N. sylvestris is considered to be the maternal donor, which about 200,000 years ago merged through interspecific hybridization with N. tomentosiformis (most likely paternal donor) to form an allotetraploid N. tabacum (2n = 4x = 48), the common tobacco [3]. Thus, the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis genome sequences are expected to have high identity to the S-genome and T-genome of N. tabacum, respectively. Both are important for understanding the biological processes - for example, regulation of gene expression, in allotetraploid N. tabacum species., 
                N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis are diploid species with an estimated 1C genome size of about 2,650 Mb. As summarized in the Plant DNA C-values database [4], the genome size estimation based on 1C measurements for N. sylvestris ranges from 2.078 to 2.812 Gb [3, 5–9], with the generally accepted size of 2.636 Gb. For N. tomentosiformis, the genome size ranges from 1.809 to 2.763 Gb [3, 7, 8], with the accepted size of 2.682 Gb., A subset of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from the Tobacco Genome Initiative [10] and conserved ortholog set (COSII) [11] was used to construct a genetic map for the diploid N. tomentosiformis (on a mapping population of N. tomentosiformis TA3385 × N. otophora TA3353) and for N. acuminata, a species closely related to N. sylvestris [12]. It was because of the failure to produce a suitable mapping population for N. sylvestris that a mapping population of N. acuminata TA3460 × N. acuminata TA3461 was used instead. A high density genetic map of an allotetraploid N. tabacum was built based on a complete set of 2,317 SSR markers applied to an F2 mapping population of Hicks Broadleaf and Red Russian [13]. Recently, another genetic map of tobacco was constructed from SSR markers applied to a mapping population of two flue-cured tobacco varieties, Honghua Dajinyuan and Hicks Broadleaf [14]. All these genetic markers can serve as anchoring points for validation of the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis genome assemblies because of their high similarity to the S- and T-genomes of tobacco., In plant biology, N. sylvestris serves as a diploid model system for studies of terpenoid production in glandular trichomes [15, 16], engineering of plastid genomes [17, 18], mitochondrial function [19, 20], herbicide resistance [21, 22] and plant virus resistance [23]. Besides its contribution to tobacco, N. sylvestris has been shown to be a modern descendent of one of the progenitors of other polyploid Nicotiana species (for example, N. nudicaulis, N. repanda, N. nesophila and N. stocktonii) [1]. Chase et al. [24] have even suggested that N. sylvestris might have been 'ancestral' to all the Nicotiana species because it easily produces crosses within the genus. N. tomentosiformis has been investigated mostly as a possible ancestor of N. tabacum., Similar to other members of the Solanaceae family, N. sylvestris produces a wide range of alkaloids that are toxic to insects; this serves as a well-established mechanism of its natural defense against damage to leaves and flowers caused by herbivores [25]. Leaves of the field-grown plants under a defoliation regime exhibit a four-fold increase in total leaf alkaloids depending on leaf position compared with undamaged control plants [26]. It was shown that wounding induces nicotine transport to the injured tissues via the jasmonate signal transduction pathway [25]. Upon wounding, accumulated jasmonates in the shoots are transported to the roots, where they stimulate nicotine synthesis leading to augmented nicotine availability throughout the plant [27]. Nicotine is the predominant alkaloid in N. sylvestris [28] and, unlike for most Nicotiana species in which the roots contain higher quantities of alkaloids compared with the leaves, the total alkaloid content in dry N. sylvestris leaves is the highest (2.96%) in the genus and only 0.786% in roots [29]. The nicotine content of N. sylvestris (82% of 4.8 mg/g total alkaloids) was found to be much higher than the nicotine content of N. tomentosiformis (6% of 0.5 mg/g total alkaloids), and this could be the driving force behind the favorable allotetraploidization between N. sylvestris and other Nicotiana species [30]. Nornicotine is the predominant alkaloid (65% of 0.5 mg/g total alkaloids) in N. tomentosiformis, which is typical for the members of Tomentosae section. In this work, we provide a genomic explanation for the dramatic differences in the alkaloid metabolism between these two Nicotiana species., The Nicotiana genus is a rich source of terpenoids, the biosynthesis of which has been reviewed previously [31, 32]. Terpenoids play a significant role as attractants to a number of insects that pollinate N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis [27]. Two of the most abundant diterpenoids, cembranoids and labdanoids, are synthesized in the trichome glands of N. tabacum cultivars. However, N. sylvestris produces predominantly labdanoids and N. tomentosiformis produces predominantly cembranoids [27, 33]. To better understand these differences at the genomic level, we attempted to investigate the structure and copy number of the genes responsible for diterpenoid metabolism in their respective genomes., Another peculiar property of Nicotiana species is their high susceptibility to accumulate cadmium as well as other heavy metals [34]. Rosén et al. [35] compared the availability of added and naturally occurring soil cadmium in N. sylvestris plants and found that cadmium concentrations in the leaves was three-fold higher than in the roots, and two-fold higher than in the soil. We examined a set of genes believed to be involved in heavy metal accumulation and describe their structural variations between the two Nicotiana plants., High quality genome sequences of tomato and potato have been published and annotated thoroughly by the Solanaceae community [36, 37]. Comparison of the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis genomes with these two reference genomes will improve our understanding of Nicotiana clade evolution and expedite the functional annotation of their genomes. A draft of the first Nicotiana genome (N. benthamiana, about 3 Gb in size) has recently been published and its utility has been shown immediately in the discovery of homologs of some immunity-associated genes [38]. Because the allotetraploid genome of N. benthamiana is a result of the hybridization of two Nicotiana species at least one of which is thought to be a member of the Sylvestres clade [30, 39], a certain degree of synteny with the genome of N. sylvestris might be expected., The estimated genome sizes of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis (approximately 2,600 Mb) are nearly three times larger than the tomato (900 Mb) [37] or potato (844 Mb) [36] genomes, a phenomenon that could be explained by repeat expansion in the Nicotiana genomes due to the accumulation of transposable elements. C0t measurements in the N. tabacum genome, which showed the presence of 55% short (approximately 300 nucleotides) and 25% long (approximately 1,500 nucleotides) repeats [40], support this hypothesis. Similarly, pepper euchromatin doubled its size compared with tomato through a massive gain of a specific group of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons [41]. The N. sylvestris genome showed signs of more recent repeat expansions with higher homogeneity, whereas the genome of N. tomentosiformis showed significantly higher repeat diversity [2]. Further, the N. sylvestris genome was reported to have a higher content of Tnt1 transposons and a more uniform distribution of the elements than the N. tomentosiformis genome [42, 43]. A more detailed analysis showed that the relative copy numbers of four retrotransposons (Tnt1-OL13, Tnt1-OL16, Tnt2d and Tto1-1R) were higher in N. sylvestris than in N. tomentosiformis [44]. Conversely, Renny-Byfield et al. [45] found that a highly repetitive DNA sequence (NicCL3) made up to 2% of the N. tomentosiformis genome but was almost absent in the N. sylvestris genome. A second repetitive DNA sequence, NicCL7/30, was also found to be more represented in N. tomentosiformis than N. sylvestris, although not as strongly. Other repeat families, EPRV [46], TAS49 [47] and GRS [43], were identified in both genomes and displayed differential copy number, distribution and methylation patterns. These findings emphasize the significant differences in the evolution of the two genomes since they diverged about 15 million years ago., The assembly of the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis transcriptomes based on 454 sequencing data showed that only 33% of the sequences contained substitutions between the two species [48]. Bombarely et al. [48] suggested that additional Illumina sequencing of the transcriptome should overcome the 'homopolymer' problem due to pyrosequencing and that genomic DNA sequencing would allow an increased number of SNPs to be identified. Elucidating the transcriptomes of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis can shed light on their protein complement, and allow more targeted experimental investigations of these and related species. Recently an Affymetrix Tobacco Exon Array was developed based on the current genome and EST sequence data from the Tobacco Genome Initiative, which cover a large proportion of the tobacco gene space [49]. Because the probes that cover both the S-genome and T-genome of N. tabacum are very similar to the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis genomes, respectively; in this study we have used the Tobacco Exon Array to investigate the differential gene expression between the latter two Nicotiana species., Here, we present the sequencing and assembly of the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis whole genomes as well as the transcriptomes from leaves, roots and flowers. We assess the assembly quality, and analyze and compare them to the existing genomes and transcriptomes from other members of the Solanaceae family. We take a more detailed look at the gene families involved in alkaloid and terpenoid metabolism and heavy metal transport because they should contribute to the unique characteristics of these two plants., Draft genomes of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis were assembled from Illumina short reads; the assemblies cover 83.3% and 71.7% of the calculated genome sizes (2.68 Gb and 2.36 Gb), respectively. Both assemblies have an N50 size of about 80 kb. The repeat content was determined to be 72 to 75% with a higher proportion of retrotransposons and copia-like LTRs in N. tomentosiformis compared with N. sylvestris. The reported draft genomes offer good coverage of coding regions, as exemplified by the heavy-metal transport and alkaloid metabolism analyses. The examination of the terpenoid metabolism gene families is more challenging because their members are numerous and highly similar, and will require further investigations., Tobacco SSR markers were mapped to both assemblies and a 65% concordance with PCR amplification data reported previously [13] was obtained. In addition, 5 to 7% of the markers that amplified in only one of the species could actually be mapped in both. Of the markers on the N. acuminata and N. tomentosiformis genetic maps, 74 to 78% could be mapped to the genome assemblies., The COSII markers from these two genetic maps were also mapped to both assemblies. In this case, only 31 to 34% of them could be mapped onto the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis assemblies, although when the same method was applied on the tomato genome, 84% of the markers present on the tomato genetic map could be mapped. This discrepancy could be due either to the still relatively high fragmentation of the Nicotiana genome assemblies, or to the COSII PCR primers not being suitable for the Nicotiana species., The transcriptome assemblies revealed the expression of 44,000 to 53,000 transcripts in roots, leaves or flowers. Flowers had the most expressed transcripts, with about 3,500 expressed transcripts not detectable in roots or leaves. The merged species transcriptomes yielded 66,000 to 68,000 expressed transcripts, encoding 39,000 proteins. When these transcripts were clustered with genes from tomato and Arabidopsis, a core set of about 7,100 clusters, a Solanaceae-specific set of about 2,800 clusters, and a Nicotiana-specific set of about 3,600 clusters were identified., Phenotypic differences observed between N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis could be explained by investigating the number of genes for specific protein families of the three metabolic pathways and their expressions in root, leaf and flower., The SOL100 initiative aims to sequence a wide range of Solanaceae species to deepen our understanding of this plant family and improve breeding of its cultivars. The draft genomes of N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis represent a significant contribution to this effort. Both are the ancestral species of allotetraploid tobacco (N. tabacum) with a 4.5 Gb genome, which currently represents a formidable challenge due to its high complexity. The genomes of the ancestor species provide a significant advance towards the assembly of the N. tabacum genome and illustrate a general strategy for the genomes of other polyploidy species such as wheat and cotton. These new genomes will increase the value of the already existing Solanaceae resources by providing additional comparative information at the genome and transcriptome levels and will help improve our understanding of plant metabolism and evolution."

Chromatin marks, such as histone modifications, provide a potential molecular mechanism for priming plants to environmental stresses, but whether transient exposure of seedlings to hyperosmotic stress leads to chromatin changes that are maintained throughout vegetative growth remains unclear., We have established an effective protocol for hyperosmotic priming in the model plant Arabidopsis, which includes a transient mild salt treatment of seedlings followed by an extensive period of growth in control conditions. Primed plants are identical to non-primed plants in growth and development, yet they display reduced salt uptake and enhanced drought tolerance after a second stress exposure. ChIP-seq analysis of four histone modifications revealed that the priming treatment altered the epigenomic landscape; the changes were small but they were specific for the treated tissue, varied in number and direction depending on the modification, and preferentially targeted transcription factors. Notably, priming leads to shortening and fractionation of H3K27me3 islands. This effect fades over time, but is still apparent after a ten day growth period in control conditions. Several genes with priming-induced differences in H3K27me3 showed altered transcriptional responsiveness to the second stress treatment., Experience of transient hyperosmotic stress by young plants is stored in a long-term somatic memory comprising differences of chromatin status, transcriptional responsiveness and whole plant physiology.","","Information storage (memory) is a prerequisite for the functioning of any biological or artificial system. Where and for how long information on experienced events should be stored depends on the purpose of the memory, such as altering immediate responses, learning through repetition, or archiving for future generations. Amount of information stored and duration of storage have to be carefully managed to avoid any negative impact on speed and fitness of the system., Memory in higher plants is evident in altered responses to environmental stimuli after pre-exposure to the same or related stimuli, termed 'priming' or 'acclimation' depending on sequence and strength of the successive stimuli. Prominent examples include seed preconditioning, temperature acclimation, and systemic acquired resistance [1–3]. Over the last 10 years research into the molecular basis of plant memory has seen a boost of activity based on emerging knowledge on the role of chromatin modifications in determining gene activity [4, 5] and trait variation [6, 7]., Heritability of chromatin modifications through mitosis and meiosis provides a potential mechanism for long-term storage of information on environmental events both within the life span of an individual ('somatic memory') and across generations ('trans-generational memory'). Several independent studies have reported chromatin changes (for example, loss of methylated DNA or of di-methylated lysine 9 in histone 3, H3K9me2) and re-activation of transposable elements in the offspring of environmentally challenged plants [8–12]. However, whether stress-induced chromatin changes are heritable through multiple generations and whether they underpin the acquisition of adaptive traits is still a matter of debate [13, 14]. The evidence to date favors the view that stress-induced trans-generational changes of the chromatin might increase survival chances of the species, rather than each individual, by broadening the phenotypic plasticity and the genetic variation within the population [15–18]., Except for vernalization [19], the importance of chromatin modifications for long-term somatic memory of individuals is also still unclear, because in most studies carried out to date the effects of biotic or abiotic stimuli on chromatin were assessed either during or immediately after the priming treatment. Such experiments have provided evidence that environmental stimuli, such as pathogen attack [20–22] or drought [23–25], alter chromatin features, both genome-wide and at specific loci, but the consequences of these changes cannot easily be separated from other changes occurring at the same time. Given their potentially stable transmission through mitosis, and hence through growth, priming-induced chromatin marks could outlive changes in transcripts, proteins, hormones, and metabolites that will underlie more or less rapid turnover, but experimental evidence for this paradigm is sparse. In one case it was reported that a decrease of tri-methylated lysine 27 in histone 3 (H3K27me3) in the cold-responsive genes COR15A and ATGOLS3, caused by a short cold treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, was still measurable 3 days after transferring the seedlings back into warm conditions although transcript levels had returned to control levels within 24 h [26]. These results have provided a first indication that H3K27me3 could be a vehicle to translate transient transcriptional changes into a long-term memory but whether the identified marks are relevant for cold-acclimation remains to be investigated., Another problem of comparative analysis of epigenetic profiles in environmentally challenged plants arises from confounding effects of plant growth and development. For example, prolonged application of drought and salt stress alter growth and development of the plants as well as inducing senescence and cell death in older leaf tissues. The phenotypic differences between treated and un-treated plants complicate the interpretation of changes in histone modification profiles obtained from entire shoots because they will not only reflect stimulus-induced changes but also changes in the relative contributions of cell-line specific profiles to the overall organ profile [27]., In the study presented here we set out to develop an experimental protocol that allowed further investigation of the roles of histone modifications in long-term somatic memory. The prevailing concern was to apply a short and mild pre-treatment that had no apparent impact on plant growth and development, and to include a period of vegetative growth between the priming treatment and the second stress treatment that was long enough to ensure dilution and turnover of proteins and metabolites that were induced by the priming treatment. Within these constraints we had to prove that the chosen priming treatment was phenotypically effective and to test whether it caused durable changes in histone modifications. Drought and salinity were chosen as environmental stimuli because they represent a good example of a natural priming situation. Thus, in arid and semi-arid environments the vegetative growth period of plants is aligned to the wet season, and therefore exposure of plants to drought (and accompanying salinity) usually occurs early and late in plant life. However, whether exposure of young plants to drought/salinity enhances tolerance in adult plants has not been systematically tested in the laboratory. Based on the development of a controlled priming protocol we show here that a short treatment of young A. thaliana plants with 50 mM NaCl alters the response of adult plants to salt and drought even though both treatments are separated by an extensive period of growth in control conditions., Four histone modifications were selected as molecular candidates for harboring a long-term somatic memory of salt stress. Di- or tri-methylated lysine 4 in histone 3 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) is enriched in transcriptionally active genes, and these two marks are particularly prominent among dehydration-responsive genes [23–25]. Furthermore, one of the enzymes catalyzing di- or tri-methylation of H3K4 (ATX1) has been shown to be required for transcriptional and physiological responses A. thaliana to dehydration [28]. H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 are mutually exclusive chromatin modifications in A. thaliana [29], established and maintained by Polycomb complexes and SUVH histone methyltransferases, respectively [30]. Both marks have been associated with epigenetic inheritance of gene repression, but potential roles in long-term somatic memory of abiotic stress in plants have not yet been explored. Using ChIP-Seq and ChIP-qPCR we monitored genome-wide profiles of all four modifications at high-resolution in primed and non-primed plants and identified specific alterations in the H3K27me3 profile that were maintained over a 10-day growth period in control conditions. Our study therefore provides evidence for a long-term somatic memory in plants at the physiological and at the molecular level., A short treatment of A. thaliana seedlings with a moderate concentration of NaCl alters physiological responses of the adult plants to salt and drought stress, and causes small but significant changes in genome-wide profiles of four histone modifications. Priming-indued 'etching' of H3K27me3 islands is still apparent after a growth period of 10 days. The number of location-specific changes of H3K27me3 decreases during this period suggesting that the memory fades over time. Nevertheless persistent differences of H3K27me3 occur in >100 genes. One of these genes, encoding the Na-transporter HKT1, is more strongly induced in the primed plants than in the non-primed plants during a second salt treatment, which could explain the observed reduction of Na accumulation in salt-primed plants. The high-resolution genome-wide datasets generated in this study provide an essential resource for further exploration of the novel molecular features of somatic long-term memory in plants unveiled by our experiments., The following additional data are available with the online version of this paper: Additional file 1 is a .pdf file containing Figures S1-4 and Tables S1-3.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are currently defined as unbalanced changes in the genome structure and include deletions, insertions, and duplications of >50 bp in size [1]., The first studies documenting the existence of numerous CNVs throughout the human genome and their relation with genetic disorders [2, 3] were followed shortly by the completion of the first CNV map of the human genome [4]. Since then, an increasing number of human studies have produced evidence for the association of CNV with complex diseases, environmental response, and population diversity (reviewed in [1]). Other large-scale studies showed that CNV is common in other animal genomes including chimpanzee and other great apes [5, 6], cattle [7, 8], rat [9], dog [10, 11], and Drosophila [12] among others., CNV is also a common feature of plant genomes and several recent studies provided insights into the extent of this type of intraspecific structural variation in plants. High levels of CNV have been found distributed throughout the maize genome, with a tendency for variants to be located near the ends of the chromosomes and the existence of high- and low-diversity regions [13–15]. The undomesticated progenitor of maize (teosinte) exhibits high levels of CNV and shares most of the variants with modern maize [15]. There is evidence that prevalent CNV in maize plays an important role in contributing to phenotypic variation as it overlaps loci associated with important traits related to stress and stimulus responses [16]. Studies in other plant species including Arabidopsis [17, 18], wheat [19], sorghum [20], rice [21, 22], and soybean [23, 24], also demonstrated that CNV contributes to the genetic diversity of their genomes. Genes affected by CNV in soybean are enriched for annotations related to stress and plant defense responses [24]. There are several examples demonstrating a causal relationship between CNV and plant phenotypes. CNV at the Rhg1 locus in soybean increases the resistance to the cyst nematode Heterodera glycines [25]. In barley, increased copy number at the boron transporter gene (Bot1) confers boron-toxicity tolerance to the African barley landrace 'Sahara' [26]. CNV at the MATE1 transporter gene in maize is associated with increased aluminum tolerance [27]., CNV can arise from a variety of molecular mechanisms including: non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) at regions of extensive sequence similarity (synonymous with unequal crossing-over); non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), which are associated with DNA repair at regions with very limited or no homology; replication-error mechanisms such as fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR); and transposable element (TE)-mediated mechanisms [28–31]. CNV could also arise from the segregation of non-allelic homologs (SNH) among F2 siblings or recombinant inbred lines (RILs) [32, 33]. NAHR is one of the best studied recombination-based mechanisms in humans, known to cause recurrent rearrangements in hotspots of homologous recombination, while replication mechanisms are a major contributor to non-recurrent CNVs [31]. In contrast, our understanding of the most prevalent contributors to CNV in plants is more limited., Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the first crops domesticated by humans approximately 10,000 years ago [34] and currently ranks fourth among cereals in terms of harvested area [35]. It is also considered a model for the Triticeae tribe, which includes other agronomically-important species such as wheat and rye. CNV is known to affect some genes with important adaptive functions in barley. As mentioned above, increased copy number of a boron transporter gene (Bot1) confers boron-toxicity tolerance [26]. CBF (C-Repeat Binding Factor) gene copy number variation at the Frost Resistant-2 locus (FR-2) is associated with low-temperature tolerance [36]. These examples, together with the recent discovery of CNV affecting two major genes controlling flowering time in wheat, Ppd-B1 and Vrn-A1 [37], suggest CNV as a potential source of agronomically important phenotypic variation in barley and other Triticeae crops., In the present study, we developed and used a barley comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array containing 2.1 M probes covering approximately 50 Mbp of repeat-masked barley sequence (cv. Morex). Fourteen barley genotypes including cultivars (H. vulgare ssp. vulgare) and wild barleys (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) were compared to the 'reference' genome of cv. Morex [38] to survey the landscape of CNV in the barley genome. The wild barley accessions allowed us to evaluate the impact of domestication and selection on the extent of overall CNV in the genome. The availability of additional sequence data from one of the cultivars surveyed by the CGH array (cv. Barke) permitted further exploration of the structural variants at the nucleotide level and provided insights into the mechanisms contributing to CNV in barley. The CNVs discovered in this study represent the first catalogue of this type of structural variation in barley to date, which provides the opportunity to characterize the types of genes affected by CNV and opens the door for future research on this type of genomic diversity in barley and other highly syntenic genomes such as rye or wheat., We report on the first comprehensive study on CNV in the genome of barley, a diploid Triticeae species. WGS sequences from the barley reference genotype 'Morex' [38] were used to design a CGH long-oligonucleotide array that covered 50 Mbp of repeat-masked barley genome sequence that was capable of detecting CNVs as small as 200 bp with a very high confidence. This type of array design has proven to be successful in discovering structural variants in the genome of other species (for example, [5, 11, 15]) and it has also been used for the characterization of mutants [45] and for high-throughput genotyping in complex genomes [46]., Here, we have surveyed the landscape of CNV in a representative panel of both cultivated and wild genotypes to discover commonalities and differences between modern barley and its undomesticated progenitor regarding this type of genomic structural variation. The use of two array designs supported the reproducibility of the results obtained. A combination of PCR assays and sequence analyses validated the majority of the detected variants that we tested. Also, as found in other studies (for example, [47]), frequency spectrum of CNV resembles that of other genetic variants such as SNPs, where most variants are at low frequency. Spectra of CNVs are similar for wild and cultivated barleys and corroborate the quality of our dataset."

Maize is an ideal model system for the study of epigenetic variations in hybrids given the significant heterotic performance, the well-known complexity of the genome, and the rich history in epigenetic studies. However, integrated comparative transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses in different organs of maize hybrids remain largely unexplored., Here, we generated integrated maps of transcriptomes and epigenomes of shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids, and globally surveyed the epigenetic variations and their relationships with transcriptional divergence between different organs and genotypes. We observed that whereas histone modifications vary both between organs and between genotypes, DNA methylation patterns are more distinguishable between genotypes than between organs. Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between organs and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements, and for different transposable elements in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species., These results suggest that despite variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different organs of maize hybrids.","maize hybrids, transcriptome, epigenome","The chromatin states and genome activity in eukaryotes are regulated by a variety of different epigenetic mechanisms, mainly DNA methylation, histone modifications, and the RNA interference pathway [1–3]. DNA methylation, that is, the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine by DNA methyltransferases, is primarily regarded as a relatively stable repressive epigenetic marker, which maintains genome stability by suppressing the activity of transposons and other repetitive sequences [4, 5]. Recent studies have also indicated an additional potential role for DNA methylation in regulating the expression of protein-coding genes [6–8]. In some cases, the methylated cytosines can be removed by DNA glycosylase [5]. Histone modifications, which are post-translational modifications of histone proteins at their N-terminal tails, provide a dynamic and reversible mechanism to regulate gene expression in response to diverse endogenous and exogenous stimuli [9, 10]. Lysine acetylation (for example, H3K9ac) and some lysine methylations (for example, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3) are associated with transcriptional activation of genes [8–11]. Small RNAs, especially small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), provide another layer of epigenetic regulatory mechanism, and repeat-associated siRNAs are known to be involved in the maintenance of genome stability by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) [1, 12, 13]., Recently, genome-wide studies of these epigenetic components using high-throughput approaches have identified complex networks of their variations during plant evolution and development. For example, some studies characterized the patterns of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small RNAs (sRNAs) in various tissues or organs of plants [7, 14, 15], whereas other studies compared the DNA-methylation patterns between different plant species or different genotypes [16–20]. Briefly, these studies revealed the conservation and divergence of epigenetic components in different plant organs or genotypes. Moreover, some studies also discovered the genome-wide epigenetic variations and their potential relationship with altered chromatin states and changed gene activity in plant hybrids. Fox example, the global DNA-methylation variations and their potential association with altered gene expression in hybrids have been extensively discussed [8, 21–25]. Further, sRNAs were also found to show extensive variation in hybrids of Arabidopsis [21, 24–26], rice [8, 23, 27] maize [28], wheat [29], and yellow poplar [30], and altered siRNA levels were presumably associated with changed DNA methylation in hybrids through the RdDM pathway [21, 23–25]., Maize is an appropriate model organism for studying global genetic and epigenetic variation in plants because of its exceptionally complex genome (in particular the high content of transposable elements (TEs)) and is a particularly rich source of epigenetic discoveries [31]. Recent studies have explored the global transcriptional variations in maize hybrids in various tissues or organs, including embryos [32, 33], endosperms [33], immature ears [34], leaves [35], stem meristem [36], seedling shoots [37, 38], and roots [39, 40]. However, the mechanisms underlying these variations and their conservation and divergence between organs remain elusive. In addition, global epigenetic profiling in maize showed that siRNA populations vary following hybridization, and are associated with regulated transposons in the seedling shoot apex and developing ear of maize hybrids [28], and that DNA methylation is associated with allelic expression of imprinted genes in the endosperm of maize hybrids [22]. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively determine both the genome-wide epigenetic variations and their association with transcriptional divergence between different organs of maize hybrids., In this study, we generated highly integrated maps of transcriptomes and epigenomes in shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids, and obtained a comprehensive view of the variation in gene expression, DNA methylation, histone modifications and sRNAs between organs and genotypes. In general, histone modifications are associated with differential gene expression between organs and between hybrids and parents, whereas, siRNAs and DNA methylation are mainly associated with regulated TEs and other repetitive elements, and thus may change the chromatin states in hybrids. Despite the variation in specific genes or genomic loci, similar global trends of transcriptomes and epigenomes were seen in both shoots and roots of reciprocal hybrids. Our data therefore may serve as a useful resource to better understand the epigenetic basis of gene action in different organs and different genetic backgrounds., How the combined genomes of parents are regulated in hybrids so as to generate significant differences in genome activities between hybrids and parents is a fundamental biological question. Recent studies suggest that such differences could be ascribed to epigenetic variations [8, 24, 25, 48]. In addition, similarities and differences in gene expression in distinct organs of maize hybrids, such as seedling shoots [37, 38] and roots [39, 40] have also been reported. In this study, we investigated the global variation in transcriptomes and epigenomes in shoots and roots of the B73 and Mo17 inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids. Our data showed that for each examined epigenetic component in the maize genome, there were no obvious differences in global distribution patterns between organs and between hybrids and parents. However, expression of specific genes or epigenetic modifications at specific genomic loci exhibited significant quantitative variation between hybrids and parents, and between different organs. Our data showed that the patterns of variation in gene expression and each epigenetic modification were distinct. Although many genes showed variation in expression in hybrids, the global patterns of gene expression showed more extensive variation between organs than between hybrids and parents (Figures 3a,c). Conversely, variation in DNA-methylation patterns was more extensive between genotypes than between organs (Figures 3b,c), suggesting a limited contribution of DNA methylation to maize development. Because only a small number of genes are identified with DNA methylation in their transcribed regions (Figure 2b) and very few genes showed simultaneous variation in gene expression and DNA methylation between hybrids and parents, the extensive variation in DNA methylation in maize hybrids were mainly associated with the activity of TEs (especially the Gypsy elements) and therefore would be expected to affect the genomic stability of hybrids (Figure 7b). Moreover, we found that histone modifications varied extensively both between organs and between genotypes (Figures 3a,c; see Additional file 2, Figure S5), and were associated with differential gene expression between organs and between hybrids and parents (Figure 4; see Additional file 2, Figure S6). These results suggest that histone modifications, which are strongly associated with transcribed regions (Figure 2b), play important roles in expression divergence both between organs and between genotypes. By contrast, DNA methylation, which is largely associated with intergenic regions (Figure 2b), may play specific roles in driving the variation in stability and activity of the hybrid genomes by altering the chromatin states., Many studies have attempted to identify specific gene sets or pathways responsible for hybrid vigor in plants by investigating differential gene expression between hybrids and their parental inbred lines [49, 50]. In the current study, we found that no biological pathway was enriched for genes showing additive or downregulated expression in shoots and roots of reciprocal hybrids; however, genes upregulated in shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway (Figure 5b; see Additional file 2, Figure S7). As a fundamental biological process required for chromosome replication and maintenance, nucleosome assembly is closely coupled with cell division, and is strongly upregulated during the S-phase of the cell cycle. In addition, it also contributes to the inheritance of chromatin states, and influences the regulation of gene activity and other processes that act on DNA [51, 52]. Because the nucleosome assembly pathway was enriched only for genes upregulated in both organs of hybrids, and because no biological pathway was enriched for genes showing organ-specific expression in hybrids, our data suggest that the enrichment of the nucleosome assembly pathway is likely to be one of the common molecular events in both shoots and roots of maize hybrids. A recent study showed that a dramatic reduction in 24 nt sRNAs strongly affected the expression of genes responsible for chromatin modifications [53], thus the enrichment of the nucleosome assembly pathway shown in the current study might be a molecular response to the large-scale changes in sRNA profiles and the RdDM pathway. However, whether this pathway is associated with hybrid vigor awaits further investigation. By contrast, no biological pathway was found to be enriched for genes showing downregulated expression in both organs of reciprocal hybrids. This may be a reflection of the fact that downregulated genes, and upregulated genes other than those involved in the nucleosome assembly pathway, are associated with various biological functions resulting from genome-wide genetic variations in hybrids., Several recent studies have explored the differences in sRNA transcriptomes between hybrids and parents [8, 21, 23–30]. In the current study, we found that much more siRNA clusters were downregulated (11,558) than upregulated (2,911) in both organs of maize hybrids, consistent with the observation that siRNAs tend to be downregulated in hybrids [8, 21, 25, 28]. Because siRNAs are involved in transcriptional silencing of TEs through the RdDM pathway [54], we therefore investigated the relationships between siRNAs, DNA methylation, and different TE classes in the maize genome. A recent study showed that 21 and 22 nt siRNAs are derived from distinct retrotransposon families, and are differentially accumulated between the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their hybrids [28]. Another study also identified a distinct size preference of sRNAs resulting from different TE families, and suggested the 22 nt sRNAs as a major component in the silencing of most TE families in soybean [15]. Our data also show that different TE classes tend to produce distinct siRNA species (Figure 7b). This observation suggests divergent effects of different TEs on chromatin states, as reported in a recent study, which reported that there are family-specific attributes for the effects of TEs on neighboring chromatin [55]., In addition, we found that whereas DNA methylation was found to be highly enriched in heterochromatic regions, siRNA clusters were not obviously enriched (for 22 nt siRNAs), or even devoid (for 21 and 24 nt siRNAs) in these regions (Figure 7a; see Additional file 2, Figure S10). However, a positive correlation between 22 nt and 24 nt siRNAs and DNA-methylation levels at the same genomic loci were also seen (Figure 7c; see Additional file 2, Figure S11). A possible explanation for these observations may be that both siRNA-dependent and siRNA-independent pathways are responsible for methylation of TEs in the maize genome, or alternatively, TE sequences in heterochromatic regions acquire DNA methylation through spreading from adjacent siRNA-targeted regions [56]., In this study, we investigated the conservation and divergence of transcriptomic and epigenomic variations in shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids. The global distribution patterns of epigenetic components between parents and hybrids contained extensive variations in the levels of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and siRNA transcription, which are conserved between shoots and roots. These diverse epigenetic variations potentially make important contributions to altered genome activity in different organs of hybrids compared with their parents by modulating chromatin states so as to accommodate hybridization. Confirmation of these results awaits further studies exploring integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling with more extensive sequencing in more organs of more hybrids."

The Arabidopsis MADS-box gene SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) is a key regulator of two developmental phases. It functions as a repressor of the floral transition during the vegetative phase and later it contributes to the specification of floral meristems. How these distinct activities are conferred by a single transcription factor is unclear, but interactions with other MADS domain proteins which specify binding to different genomic regions is likely one mechanism., To compare the genome-wide DNA binding profile of SVP during vegetative and reproductive development we performed ChIP-seq analyses. These ChIP-seq data were combined with tiling array expression analysis, induction experiments and qRT-PCR to identify biologically relevant binding sites. In addition, we compared genome-wide target genes of SVP with those published for the MADS domain transcription factors FLC and AP1, which interact with SVP during the vegetative and reproductive phases, respectively., Our analyses resulted in the identification of pathways that are regulated by SVP including those controlling meristem development during vegetative growth and flower development whereas floral transition pathways and hormonal signaling were regulated predominantly during the vegetative phase. Thus, SVP regulates many developmental pathways, some of which are common to both of its developmental roles whereas others are specific to only one of them.","MADS-box, gene regulation, transcription factors, post transcriptional regulation, ChIP-seq, floral transition, floral development, 
                Arabidopsis thaliana
              ","In plants organs are formed post-embryonically from populations of undifferentiated cells called meristems. In these meristems, stem cell activity is kept at the central zone whereas at the peripheral part of the meristem primordia arise in which cells differentiate into organs. In flowering plants like Arabidopsis thaliana during the vegetative phase the primordia that derive from the shoot apical meristem (SAM) develop into leaves [1, 2]. The change to the subsequent generative phase is called floral transition, which is regulated by multiple flowering pathways that are controlled by environmental and endogenous cues. During the floral transition, the SAM undergoes a change in fate and becomes an inflorescence meristem (IM). The Arabidopsis IM is an indeterminate meristem and develops multiple determinate floral meristems (FMs) in a spiral manner, which in turn produce a precise number of floral organs arranged in a whorled pattern [1, 3, 4]. The reprogramming of meristems is regulated by a complex gene regulatory network in which transcription factors represent important key players., In Arabidopsis the photoperiod, thermosensory, and vernalization/autonomous pathways that respond to environmental signals, and the aging and gibberellic acid pathways that respond to the developmental and physiological state of the plant regulate the floral transition [5]. Many transcription factors encoding genes have been shown to be involved in the regulation of these pathways including those belonging to the MADS-box gene family [6, 7]. One of these MADS-box genes controlling flowering time is SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) [8]., MADS-domain transcription factors have been identified in all eukaryotic kingdoms and in Arabidopsis thaliana they are involved in most important developmental processes [9–12]. MADS-domain factors activate or repress transcription by direct binding to short sequences called CArG-boxes that correspond to a 10 nucleotide sequence CC(A/T)6GG present in the regulatory sequences of target genes. However, this motif can be quite variable allowing some mismatches [10, 13]. Moreover MADS-domain proteins form homo and/or heterodimers and are also suggested to form tetrameric MADS-domain complexes [14]. The variety of interactions that many MADS-domain factors can make suggests that they may regulate different subsets of genes during different phases of development and might reflect an enormous regulatory potential [15]. Furthermore, their association with others co-factors probably also influences the affinity and specificity of the complex for specific target sequences [16, 17]., During the vegetative phase SVP acts as a repressor of flowering since the svp mutant flowers very early [8]. SVP mediates flowering responses by perceiving signals from different endogenous and environmental flowering pathways such as the thermosensory, autonomous, and GA pathways [6, 18]. SVP regulates the expression of three floral pathways integrator genes (FPI) that are FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) which all promote flowering [18, 19]. To maintain plants in the vegetative phase, SVP represses the expression of FT and TSF in the phloem and SOC1 in the SAM by directly binding to CArG boxes in FT and SOC1 [6, 18, 19]. During the vegetative phase, SVP interacts with another central repressor of flowering time that is FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and their function is mutually dependent. In fact it has recently been demonstrated that the SVP-FLC dimer acts to directly repress FT in the leaves and SOC1 in the SAM [18]. During the floral transition, SVP expression gradually decreases until the SVP protein completely disappears from the IM [20]. In plants competent to flower, inputs deriving from the flowering pathways converge to repress SVP and FLC expression [18, 19]. During the vegetative phase SVP plays an opposite role to its phylogenetically closest related MADS-box gene AGAMOUS LIKE 24 (AGL24), which is a central promoter of flowering [21, 22]. Both SVP and AGL24 directly regulate SOC1 by binding its promoter on the same binding sites but they have an opposite effect on SOC1 expression [23]., Interestingly, after the floral transition both SVP and AGL24 are co-expressed in the floral meristem during stage 1 and 2 of flower development [24]. Analysis of the svp
                        agl24 double mutant, especially at higher temperatures, and the svp ap1 agl24 triple mutants showed that AGL24 and SVP play redundant roles during these early stages of flower development [20, 24, 25]. Combining the svp
                        agl24 double mutant with a weak ap1 allele showed that AGL24 and SVP together with AP1 repress floral homeotic genes that control petal, stamen and carpel identity [25]. Protein interaction and genetic studies revealed that SVP and AGL24 are able to form dimers with AP1 and that this dimer is able to recruit the LEUNIG-SEUSS co-repressor complex [15, 25]. Combining the svp
                        agl24 double mutant with a strong ap1 allele showed that they are also controlling floral meristem identity since this triple mutant forms on the flanks of the IM new IMs instead of FMs resulting in a cauliflower like curd just as observed in the ap1
                        cauliflower (cal) double mutant [24, 26]. Recently Simonini et al. [17] have shown that the co-repressor complex composed of LUG, SEU, and SVP is also able to repress the ovule identity gene SEEDSTICK (STK) in a complex together with BASIC PENTACYSTEINE transcription factors., SVP is a key factor for Arabidopsis development and acts both during vegetative and reproductive phases where it plays different roles probably by interacting with different partners to regulate specific sets of target genes. Even though SVP is a gene of interest since its first characterization [8], still little is known about the mode of action and the network of genes controlled by this MADS-domain transcription factor. A powerful tool to study in vivo the genome-wide DNA-binding patterns of transcription factors is the ChIP-seq technology that consists in ultra-high throughput Solexa (Illumina) sequencing of DNA samples obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). This technique has been used for a few years to identify direct target genes. At first for human transcription factors like NRSF, STAT1, PPARγ, and FOXA2 [27–30] and recently this technology has been reported for the identification in Arabidopsis of genome wide targets of different MADS-domain proteins such as, SEPALLATA3 (SEP3), AP1, FLC, and SOC1 [13, 31–33] and another important transcriptional regulator such as AP2 [34]. Moreover genome wide binding site analysis is also possible using the ChIP on chip method, as was done for AGAMOUS LIKE 15 (AGL15), LEAFY (LFY), SVP, and SOC1 [35–37]., Here we report the use of the ChIP-seq approach to identify genome wide binding sites for SVP, during two distinct developmental phases: the vegetative and reproductive phase. This study allowed us to identify new pathways that are regulated by SVP in vegetative and reproductive tissues and to investigate genome-wide interaction dynamics of a transcription factor during different phases of development., The MADS-domain factor SVP has different functions during development. An 'early' function as a repressor of the floral transition and a 'later' function in floral meristem identity specification [6, 8, 18, 20, 24, 25, 48]. These two functions are also reflected by SVP expression, which is present in the leaves and SAM during the vegetative phase, is repressed in the meristem when plants switch to reproductive development and then reappears in the floral meristem during the early stages of flower development [8, 24]. Whether SVP regulates different or similar sets of genes during these two phases of development is unknown. We employed ChIP-seq analysis to study the genome-wide binding behavior of SVP during these phases. SVP was found to bind to approximately 3,000 genes at both stages of development. Some genes were regulated by SVP at both stages of development, such as those in pathways regulating meristem development, whereas others were specific to one of the stages. One mechanism by which these differences in target gene specificity are likely to occur is through interactions between SVP and other MADS domain protein partners generating complexes with different specificities. Consistent with this idea, comparison of the targets of SVP and two of its partners, AP1 and FLC, showed similarities and differences."

The collection includes inbred lines from breeding programs all over the world., The method produced 681,257 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers distributed across the entire genome, with the ability to detect rare alleles at high confidence levels. More than half of the SNPs in the collection are rare. Although most rare alleles have been incorporated into public temperate breeding programs, only a modest amount of the available diversity is present in the commercial germplasm. Analysis of genetic distances shows population stratification, including a small number of large clusters centered on key lines. Nevertheless, an average fixation index of 0.06 indicates moderate differentiation between the three major maize subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decays very rapidly, but the extent of LD is highly dependent on the particular group of germplasm and region of the genome. The utility of these data for performing genome-wide association studies was tested with two simply inherited traits and one complex trait. We identified trait associations at SNPs very close to known candidate genes for kernel color, sweet corn, and flowering time; however, results suggest that more SNPs are needed to better explore the genetic architecture of complex traits., The genotypic information described here allows this publicly available panel to be exploited by researchers facing the challenges of sustainable agriculture through better knowledge of the nature of genetic diversity.","Diversity, Genotyping by sequencing, Germplasm, Maize, Public","Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important crops in the world, being one of the main sources of human food, animal feed, and raw material for some industrial processes [1].Furthermore, maize is a significant model plant for the scientific community to study phenomena such as hybrid vigor, genome evolution, and many other important biological processes. The maize genome is complex, and has a very high level of genetic diversity compared with other crops and model plant species [2]. The Zea genome is in constant flux, with transposable elements changing the genome and affecting genetic diversity [3]. Structural variations between any two maize plants are prevalent and are enriched relative to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers as significant loci associated with important phenotypic traits [4]. The availability of new sequencing technologies at increasingly affordable prices has provided the opportunity to investigate more deeply the maize genome and its diversity, enabling genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) strategies., Since the beginning of the 20th Century, when Shull [5] and East [6] first investigated inbreeding and heterosis in maize, breeding programs around the world have developed maize inbred lines using diverse strategies. The USDA-ARS North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station (NCRPIS) in Ames, Iowa, an element of the National Plant Germplasm System, along with germplasm banks around the world, has conserved distinct inbred lines that represent nearly a century of maize breeding efforts. Researchers have genotypically characterized subsets of these maize inbred lines to assist with curatorial management of germplasm collections, to evaluate diversity within breeding programs, and for use in association mapping [7–10]. Some association panels have been used successfully to characterize many different traits, frequently through a candidate gene strategy [11]. However, the sample sizes used in these studies may not have been large enough to detect all of the key quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the complex traits. Furthermore, the nature of population structure in maize may have resulted in further dilution of statistical power and high rates of false discovery [12]. In addition, candidate gene strategies require an understanding of the biochemical or regulatory pathways controlling the traits., Recently, Elshire et al. [13] developed a simple new sequencing procedure that provides a large number of markers across the genome at low cost per sample. The approach, called genotyping by sequencing (GBS), can be applied to species with high diversity and large genomes such as maize. It does not rely on previous knowledge of SNPs; however, the high-quality reference genome for the maize inbred B73 [14] is used at this point to anchor the position of the SNPs. The method enables characterization of germplasm collections on a genome-wide scale, and greatly expands the number of individuals and markers under study, which then increases the chances of discovering more uncommon or rare variants [15]. In maize, there are examples of important rare alleles unique to some groups of germplasm, such as alleles at crtRB1 that increase β-carotene concentrations in kernels [16]. Several studies have also suggested that rare alleles could explain the 'missing heritability' problem. This is the phenomenon by which a large portion of the inferred genetic variance for a trait is often not fully accounted for by the loci detected by GWAS [17]. Moreover, the increased number of samples and markers allow a deeper study of haplotype structures and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Regions with strong LD and large haplotype blocks as a result of reduced recombination make it more difficult to separate genes that can have different effects, affecting both mapping and/or selection of the positive alleles for a trait. This linkage between favorable and negative alleles also contributes to heterosis [18]., In the current study, we used GBS to analyze a total of 4,351 maize samples from 2,815 maize accessions with 681,257 SNP markers distributed across the entire genome. These data allowed us to 1) compare this new sequencing technology with other available options, 2) explore the potential of this new technology to help with curation and use of germplasm, 3) evaluate genetic diversity and population structure both across the genome and between groups of germplasm, 4) investigate the history of recombination and LD through the different breeding groups, and 5) explore the potential of the collection as a resource to study the genetic architecture of quantitative traits., The challenges currently facing agriculture, that is, rapid human population growth, climate change, and the need to balance increasing production with reduced environmental effects, make it necessary to optimize the use of available resources. Genomic data can be used to address these challenges by helping breeders to compare individual plant genomes and optimize the characterization, discovery, and use of functional genetic variation [38]. Germplasm banks around the world curate thousands of maize accessions that, in combination with genomic data, can be explored through GWAS or GS, and could potentially be used for improving agriculturally significant quantitative traits. Inexpensive methods to obtain dense genetic marker information on large samples of germplasm are needed to take full advantage of this tremendous resource [39]., The enormous progress in sequencing technologies that has occurred over the past few years has allowed better understanding of the maize genome. High-density genome sequencing has been used to study maize diversity [4, 23–25]. In addition, several studies [39–42] have taken advantage of recently developed SNP genotyping arrays for maize, which have evolved quickly from only a few thousand SNPs to more than 50,000. Although high-density genome sequencing can provide a larger number of markers and a more accurate vision of the genome, its expense has restricted it to only a few hundred samples per study. SNP arrays are cheaper and can analyze larger samples of germplasm; however diversity studies can be confounded by the fact that SNPs are developed using reference sources of diversity, which may cause an important ascertainment bias (Ganal et al [19] describes an example with B73 and Mo17 in the maizeSNP50 chip). GBS has been shown to be a less expensive method for genotyping large numbers of samples, and provides many more SNPs than do SNP arrays. Although the use of a reference genome for calling SNPs from GBS data might cause bias and underestimate the amount of diversity from the groups more distant from the reference, the diversity picture obtained when analyzing the distance matrix seems to be closer to the expectations from simple sequence repeats studies [8], whole-genome sequencing, and maize domestication data [23] than that obtained with SNP arrays., The percentage of missing data from GBS with enzymes such as ApeKI and the levels of coverage obtained here may be a problem for some applications, especially GWAS and GS. Although better coverage can be achieved with more repetitions of the samples, this will increase cost, and quickly reaches a point where there is little reduction in missing data with increased investment in repeated sequencing runs. Given the importance of PAV in maize [2, 3, 24, 43] some of the missing data are very probably due to the absence of some regions of the B73 genome in other inbred lines. As shown here, simple imputation procedures based on identifying the most similar haplotype can be used to supply some of those missing data, and this imputation may be sufficiently accurate provided that similar haplotypes are present in the sample of genotypes. This kind of procedure may work better as the total number of maize samples in the GBS database increases, but it may also cause over imputation of data that are actually biologically missing as a result of a PAV. Alternative methods for handling missing SNP data in GBS datasets include an approach that avoids using a reference genome, such as the one recently used for switchgrass [44], or one that genetically maps individual GBS sequence tags as dominant markers [13]., Another important difference between the results obtained with GBS and the results from SNP array methods seems to be the MAF distribution. Whereas array assays seem to oversample SNPs with intermediate frequencies [45] even when analyzing diverse maize collections [9, 41], more than half of GBS SNPs within our collection are rare (this is especially true within some of the more diverse germplasm groups). As sequencing technologies improve, the number of rare alleles detected is increasing. In humans, recent studies have found that the majority of variable genomic sites are rare, and exhibit little sharing between diverged populations [46]. The importance of rare alleles is not yet completely clear, and further studies to understand the magnitude of their role causing observable phenotypic variation are underway [38]. There are strong arguments both in favor and against the rare allele model, which hypothesizes that quantitative traits are largely controlled by rare alleles of large effect [15, 17]., GWAS studies have shown that variation in some traits is related to rare alleles, and that those rare variants could explain an additional fraction of the missing heritability [15]. However, identifying rare variants through GWAS is challenging, and requires large sample sizes [38]. With the present work, we present an extensive genetic characterization of the maize inbred lines preserved by one of the largest crop germplasm banks in the world, using a method that detects rare alleles with high confidence levels. Moreover, our data show that when there are not enough resources to extensively evaluate the entire collection, a smaller number of samples (such as the maize association panel or even the NAM parents), can, if chosen based on appropriate criteria to maximize haplotype diversity, capture a high portion of the rare alleles, allowing detection of rare allele effects that may be desirable to incorporate into breeding programs., A complication of using the entire USDA-ARS maize inbred collection for breeding or GWAS is the close relationships between some of the lines. When the seed yield of a few inbreds derived from the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic and their derivatives facilitated the transition to single-cross hybrids, these inbreds became the female parents of choice for many breeding programs [47]. For example B73, the main founder of the stiff stalk group, is closely related to more than 50 other inbred lines from different programs in the collection. Several germplasm sources were used to generate the male pool (non-stiff stalk). However, the visualization of the genetic relationships through the MDS shows that even if the non-stiff stalk group forms a larger cluster (revealing a higher amount of diversity), an overlap between the stiff stalk and non-stiff stalk group still exists., As shown by the MDS plot and Fst values, most of the germplasm from classic breeding programs of the Corn Belt region is closely related. The bottleneck is even narrower when ExPVPs are examined. Using a much smaller sample of SNP markers, Nelson et al. [48] reported that most of the ExPVPs released in the past three decades could be clustered into six primary groups represented by six prominent public inbred lines. More recently, Mikel [49] studied the pedigree records of several inbreds registered until 2008, and found that the genetic contribution of the inbred Mo17 decreased, whereas that of Oh43 increased. Our analysis shows that the ExPVP inbreds tend to cluster into three main groups, with B73, Mo17/Oh43, and PH207 being the principal connectors within each cluster. Although all of the major private seed companies are represented within each group (consistent with the small value of divergence between companies), Pioneer germplasm is represented more in the iodent group (including PH207) and more of its germplasm falls outside the three main clusters (B73, PH207/Oh43, and PH207). This result is in concordance with the observed smaller average haplotype length of Pioneer germplasm., Although the recycling of elite lines as breeding parents has markedly reduced the amount of diversity used by maize breeders over the past few decades, breeders have also been aware of the importance of maintaining and introducing diversity into their programs [50]. The determination of breeders to search for new sources of promising, exotic germplasm is reflected in the Ames inbred collection. For instance, the GEM program aims to broaden the germplasm base of corn hybrids grown by farmers in the USA [51]. Combining the efforts of public and private cooperators, this project has introduced tropical alleles into elite USA germplasm. Our molecular characterization of these materials shows that the GEM program has been effective, as most of its inbreds lie somewhere between the ExPVPs and tropical materials on the MDS plot. According to our results, other public programs that have succeeded in incorporating tropical diversity into their materials are North Carolina State University and the University of Missouri. On the other side of the graph, adaptation to colder climates has been accomplished using different heterotic pools within the Northern USA and Canadian programs. Overall, although inbred lines from breeding programs from other parts of the globe might have different haplotype combinations (related to the use of different breeding pools), the USA and Canadian public inbred lines preserved at NCRPIS capture most of the total allelic diversity uncovered in this study., GBS has yielded the greatest number of SNPs ever obtained from a large maize association panel to date. As seen with our GWAS analysis, the data can provide accurate mapping of simple and complex traits for the most important genes. Van Inghelandt et al. [52] suggested that with an association panel of 1,537 elite maize inbred lines, 65,000 SNPs should be sufficient to detect associations with the genes with biggest effects. Lu et al. [41] used a panel containing tropical and temperate materials, and suggested that 230,000 to 460,000 markers would be needed. However when comparing the results for the two locations with the best flowering time associations in our study, we observed that the most important flowering time gene, ZmCCT, was targeted with only one SNP, meaning that it could easily have been missed. By contrast, the Vgt1 peak showed more than 80 SNPs associated with the trait (Figure 11). The main difference between these two important QTL is that the ZmCCT polymorphism is very rare in temperate materials with very low levels of LD, whereas the Vgt1 variation is common in temperate inbred lines that have higher LD. When GBS data are used to perform GWAS, the probability of finding the causative SNPs in the dataset is highly dependent on the trait itself and the germplasm in which it is expressed. The length and number of the haplotypes detected vary enormously, depending on the region of the genome and the germplasm group. Some germplasm groups are currently under-represented in our maize dataset. As a result, population bottlenecks can cause a polymorphism that is not present at an appreciable frequency to pass the GBS pipeline quality filters. Therefore, it is unlikely that a causative polymorphism is present in the GBS dataset if it is unique to one of these germplasm groups. In addition, if the region has high haplotype diversity, rapid LD decay indicates that it is very likely that, even with approximately 700,000 SNPs we might not find a marker in LD with a particular causative polymorphism of interest. This situation is reflected in a large portion of chromosome 10 where the ZmCCT gene is located, and tropical inbreds have much greater haplotype diversity than the rest of the collection. This means that, although 700,000 SNP markers are likely to be sufficient for analysis of temperate alleles, they are not sufficient to perform accurate GWAS with tropical alleles., However, numerous inbreds in the collection are IBD for specific regions, allowing a strategy of accurate imputation. Based on common local haplotypes defined with GBS SNPs, high-density markers for a representative inbred obtained through whole-genome sequencing can be imputed between GBS markers, thereby increasing marker density., In summary, our GWAS results for days to silking showed that this association panel combined with the GBS information can help to dissect the genetic architecture of important agronomic complex traits. Our best association signals corresponded to regions in which a priori candidate genes or previously identified flowering time QTL are located. Nevertheless, identifying the causal gene is complex. Excluding the ZmCCT gene hit on chromosome 10, all other major associations contain several SNPs. These hits cover regions that can extend for more than 10 Mb, even though our average LD decays very rapidly. For Arabidopsis [53] and rice [54], the results suggest that the occurrence of these 'mountain landscapes' could be related to the presence of several linked genes across the region. In maize, the dissection of a candidate region contributing to flowering time variation on chromosome 6 suggests that a cluster of tightly linked genes are responsible for the phenotypic variation [55]. In our study, the linked associations on chromosome 8 correspond with the position of two known flowering time genes, ZmRap2.7 [30] and ZCN8 [56]. A similar situation occurs for the hits on chromosome 7 with candidates DLF1 and FRI. Lastly, on our chromosome 1 region, extended haplotype lengths for some subpopulations and a strong correlation between the region and population structure have been reported [37]. Within 3 Mb, there are genes that have been under selection since the domestication of maize including tb1 and d8 [25, 36] and two strong candidate genes for flowering time (CCT and PhyA1). All these results for our candidate regions support the hypothesis of the presence of some multigene complexes that may have evolved together during the process of maize domestication and adaptation. Further studies to unravel these regions and better understand the genetic architecture of flowering time are needed. Flowering time and adaptation to temperate climates are complex traits that seem to be controlled by several genes with small effects, organized in clusters across the genome., As previous studies have suggested [7, 8, 39], the genetic diversity preserved at germplasm banks can be a useful resource for breeders and geneticists. Development of new germplasm will benefit from the knowledge of alleles from diverse materials associated with targeted traits [57], and from the methods and tools used to mine and translate this knowledge into products. However, collections may remain a hidden treasure if the amount and distribution of genetic diversity preserved is not understood, preventing users from making the right choices with the available material. With this study, we have provided the maize research community with a new tool that can be used to better understand and manipulate the genetic architecture of complex traits. It will permit more efficient and targeted use of the breeders' work and of the vast amount of diversity available in the USDA-ARS maize germplasm bank. Experimental designs based on particular haplotypes or maximizing the diversity for a determined number of entries may be possible, optimizing the resources available to each researcher."

Phenotypic variance in the transcriptional landscape of the grape berry","Alisdair R Fernie, Takayuki Tohge","Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology","Alisdair R Fernie","fernie@mpimp-golm.mpg.de","7 June 2013","","","Evaluation of the common grapevine Vitis vinifera across multiple harvests and field locations provides important insights into crop transcriptional plasticity under diverse agricultural regimes., Please see related Research: http://​genomebiology.​com/​2013/​14/​6/​R54
              , Current cultivation practice in vineyards, whereby clonally propagated scions (shoots used for grafting) are grafted onto disease-resistant rootstocks of a different cultivar, renders the grapevine an interesting crop in which to study phenotypic plasticity, given that phenotypic variance driven by genetic factors is very much minimized (although not entirely removed due to genetic differences in rootstock). Indeed, many other crop plants are vegetatively propagated, including many fruit tree species, as well as vegetable crops propagated by stolons, runners, bulbs, tubers or corms. Understanding phenotypic plasticity is also of interest in species with more varied genetics since it will undoubtedly provide critical information to guide next-generation crop improvement strategies., Previous studies examining transcriptional responses to environmental changes have been performed in model organisms such as Drosophila, nematode and mouse, as well as more exotic species such as marine coral, sparrow and salmon. The most recent and most extensive of these studies was carried out by Zhou et al. in Drosophila, revealing that the majority of the transcriptome shows robust expression across a diverse range of environmental challenges, with only approximately 15% of transcripts being plastic [5]. The plastic transcripts were split into those with high or low genetic variability. They did, however, include a large number of modules of genes, including transcription factors and non-coding RNAs, presumed to play a role in chromatin structure, as well as a range of glucosyltransferases and cytochrome P450s involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Furthermore, analysis of the dataset was compared with the prevailing models of the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity. Under the allelic sensitivity model, allele type affects the mean value of a phenotype, whereas under the gene regulation model, plasticity is a trait in itself, which is under the control of regulatory loci [9]. Tellingly, the data of Zhou et al. support the gene regulatory model, as do many other recent studies [9]., Dal Santo et al. appraised the level of plasticity in transcript levels in connection with varying the environment, either with regard to field location (and in some instances rootstock used) or with regard to the cultivation year. As stated earlier, the common grapevine is clonally propagated and thus studies in this species focus on gene regulatory plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity in crop species can be costly; in grapes, the same clone has been documented to show variability within individual berries, among berries in a cluster, between clusters on a vine and among vines in the vineyard. Thus, berry quality may be affected in an unpredictable manner and developmental factors such as uniformity of ripening may be compromised., In analyzing the berry transcriptome at the scale they did, Dal Santo et al. were able to identify transcripts expressed under normal and unusual weather conditions in addition to defining the plastic complement of the grape transcriptome. They achieved this by means of a carefully planned and executed study in which the 11 vineyards chosen maximized differences in both environmental conditions and agricultural practices across the Verona region. Each sample was taken in triplicate on the same day and spanned three developmental stages (Figure 1), thus allowing multiple statistical comparisons to be made. Firstly, cluster analysis of grape berries across multiple years, but from a subset of the vineyards, revealed a number of interesting traits. Namely, analysis of veraison, the onset of ripening, revealed sets of genes related to: (1) DNA/RNA metabolic processes and transcription factors; (2) hormone metabolism and redox balance; (3) cell wall expansion, hemicellulose modification and carbohydrate dissimilation; and (4) disease resistance and heat shock factors. Mid- and late-ripening stages were instead characterized by major differences in transcripts associated with secondary metabolites., The data from later harvest points were supported by comparative metabolome analyses between the harvests, which additionally indicated complementary variance in stilbene compounds. This important finding highlights that the massive reprogramming of the berry transcriptome in response to the environment includes metabolic pathways underlying quality traits that are essential to the commercial value of the crop. A second comparison involving data of a single harvest from all 11 vineyards revealed that the proportion of genes that were plastic in the grape berry was of a similar magnitude to that previously reported for Drosophila [5]. Interestingly, there was considerable overlap between the functional classifications of both grape and Drosophila lists, with 'translation', 'nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic processes', 'regulation of gene expression, epigenetic', 'transcription factor activity' and the glutathione S-transferase family being highly represented in the plastic genes of both species. Unsurprisingly, quite distinctive gene functions are also reported for the grape gene set, including several homologs of genes involved in floral transition and organ identify, such as EARLY FLOWERING, CONSTANS, FRIGIDA and SEPALLATA being reported as plastic. Remarkably, the combined expression level signature of these plastic transcripts was demonstrated to be a powerful biomarker largely able to separate berries on the basis of the vineyard in which they were grown - irrespective of their developmental stage. Further studies aimed at ascertaining whether specific transcript changes were associated with groups of vineyards sharing either common agricultural practices or environmental features. Importantly, only the trellising system and the geographical area could be statistically linked to these changes, and the contribution of the four different rootstock genotypes to the plastic expression of berries is only marginal. This is of particular importance when the data are compared with the models of plasticity mentioned earlier, since it indicates that the plastic genes here are exclusively driven by gene regulatory mechanisms, and not allelic differences. In addition, the proportion of plastic genes reported here being similar to those in the more highly genetically diverse Drosophila population, in combination with the nature of the identified genes displaying plasticity, together provide strong evidence in support of the gene regulatory model of plasticity., As well as providing important input into the debate on the causes of plasticity, these data are likely to be highly important with regard to crop improvement. The data indicate that veraison is a critical period at which the seasonal climate exerts highest effect, whereas micro-environment and agronomic practices are of only marginal importance, with oxidative stress being of particular note at this developmental stage. During later stages of development, the influence of climate wanes and, accordingly, those of the micro-environment and agronomic practices come into their own, with the exception of transcripts associated with secondary metabolism and indeed the metabolites themselves. Many of the plastic genes identified both at veraison and during berry development are likely well worth looking at in the context of the regulation of ripening and, as such, may represent important targets for crop improvement. The recent sequencing of tomato methylome [10] and the suggested role of epigenetic factors in the ripening process further underscore this statement. As Dal Santo et al. themselves acknowledge, the causality within such associations will certainly require further investigation. Although to date traditional breeding has led to major advances in agriculture, including the green revolution, it remains a relatively inefficient process with an enormous opportunity for improvement. Given that many studies highlight the difficulties in transposing lab results into the field, the need for large-scale in-field testing (of the scale performed by Dal Santo et al.) is great. Their study represents an important benchmark for post-genomics era crop genetics, not only in shedding new light on the decade old questions of mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity and canalization, but also for identifying new tools for trait identification and crop improvement."

These phenotypic variations are attributable to the effect of the environment on the expression and function of genes influencing plastic traits. We investigated phenotypic plasticity in grapevine by comparing the berry transcriptome in a single clone of the vegetatively-propagated common grapevine species Vitis vinifera cultivar Corvina through 3 consecutive growth years cultivated in 11 different vineyards in the Verona area of Italy., Most of the berry transcriptome clustered by year of growth rather than common environmental conditions or viticulture practices, and transcripts related to secondary metabolism showed high sensitivity towards different climates, as confirmed also by metabolomic data obtained from the same samples. When analyzed in 11 vineyards during 1 growth year, the environmentally-sensitive berry transcriptome comprised 5% of protein-coding genes and 18% of the transcripts modulated during berry development. Plastic genes were particularly enriched in ontology categories such as transcription factors, translation, transport, and secondary metabolism. Specific plastic transcripts were associated with groups of vineyards sharing common viticulture practices or environmental conditions, and plastic transcriptome reprogramming was more intense in the year characterized by extreme weather conditions. We also identified a set of genes that lacked plasticity, showing either constitutive expression or similar modulation in all berries., Our data reveal candidate genes potentially responsible for the phenotypic plasticity of grapevine and provide the first step towards the characterization of grapevine transcriptome plasticity under different agricultural systems.","Phenotypic plasticity, Transcriptome, Grapevine","Most organisms show evidence of phenotypic plasticity, that is, the ability of a single genotype to produce a range of phenotypes as a function of its environment [1]. This represents a key strategy to maximize fitness when challenged by environmental heterogeneity [2]. Moreover, sessile organisms such as plants rely on phenotypic plasticity to cope with the changing environment, so the phenomenon has a significant impact on evolution, ecology and agriculture [3–5] as well as on plant responses and adaption in the context of rapid climate change [3]. Although phenotypic plasticity is an important ecological phenomenon, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain still poorly characterized [6]., Phenotypic variation between species and organism of the same species may reflect differences in gene structure as well as differences in gene expression, but phenotypic plasticity among clones of the same genotype is likely to be much more dependent on differential gene expression in different environments [7]. The availability of high-throughput expression profiling technologies now makes it possible to analyze gene expression (activity and spatiotemporal characteristics) on a global scale, so that transcriptome plasticity can be investigated directly [7–9]. Transcriptome plasticity has recently been described in model organisms such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [10], the mouse Mus musculus [11], and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [12]. Other studies have considered the transcriptional basis of phenotypic variation in non-model organisms in the wild or under controlled environments [13–16]., Few comprehensive studies have been reported for plants cultivated in open fields, where they are exposed to multiple environmental stimuli that induce complex responses in terms of gene expression, metabolic activity, and epigenetic modifications. These studies have focused mainly on transcriptome remodeling in response to individual abiotic factors [17, 18] or during a single developmental process [19]. Recently Richards et al. [20] analyzed the genome-wide gene expression pattern in two accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana and explored the correlation between gene expression and natural environmental fluctuations. This revealed that accession is an important component of transcriptional variation among individuals in the field., Grapevine (Vitis spp., family Vitaceae) is the most widely-cultivated perennial fruit crop in the world, with 67.5 million tons of berries produced in 2011 [21]. The berries are characterized by considerable phenotypic plasticity, with the same clone showing variability within individual berries, among berries within a cluster, between clusters on a vine, and among vines in the vineyard, according to both environmental factors and viticulture practices [22]. This can be considered a burden because the berries may mature unevenly and display large interseasonal fluctuations in quality, but it also offers advantages such as the ability to adapt existing cultivars to specific growing regions and to produce different wines from the same cultivar [23]., We investigated the extent to which phenotypic plasticity in grape berries reflects underlying changes in the transcriptome by using NimbleGen microarray technology in combination with the complete grapevine genome sequence [24] to study global gene expression profiles in a single clone of Vitis vinifera cv Corvina cultivated in different vineyards and harvested at different developmental stages over 3 consecutive years. We monitored the transcriptomic response to seasonal changes, highlighting transcripts expressed under both normal and unusual weather conditions. We identified the component of the grapevine transcriptome that is plastic, allowing different developmental responses under diverse growing conditions. We studied the relationships among differential gene expression profiles, growing conditions and ripening parameters and identified several putative candidate genes for the definition of berry quality traits. The large-scale sampling procedure we used also allowed the identification of non-plastic genes such as constitutive housekeeping genes that provide useful references for quantitative expression analysis, and developmental markers that may be suitable for the on-field monitoring of berry ripening., The biological material at our disposal offered a unique opportunity to compare the same grapevine berry phenological phases in different vineyards and growth years, allowing us to correlate changes in the transcriptome with distinct growing conditions., Our data suggest that veraison is a critical period during which the seasonal climate has its greatest effect whereas the microenvironment and agronomic practices had only a marginal impact (Figure 2a). The direct influence of climate on berry quality has been demonstrated, particularly the additive effects of temperature and water availability [51, 52]. Many genes were differentially expressed among the years at veraison, with the greatest difference observed between the 2007 and 2008 seasons (Figure 2b). 2007 is characterized by the specific upregulation of genes related to disease resistance, abiotic stress adaptation and the oxidative burst, reflecting the severe stress imposed on this growth year by the high spring temperatures. The 2008 season is characterized by the significant upregulation of genes involved in DNA/RNA metabolic processes and transcription. The basis of this transcriptome reprogramming is hard to define since the climate was similar in the 2006 and 2008 seasons, but it may reflect a compensatory adaptation following the unusual 2007 season., The strong effect of growth year on sample correlation faded during berry ripening (see Additional File 5, Figure S1a and S1b) suggesting that the impact of agronomic practices and environmental conditions on the berry transcriptome becomes more important at this stage. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify season-specific modulated genes at mid-ripening and at harvest. The major difference between the growth years involved secondary metabolism, particularly the broad expression of phenylpropanoid-related genes in 2006 and 2008 compared to 2007 berries. Indeed, we observed the induction of at least 13 phenylalanine ammonia lyases, (PALs), 43 stilbene synthases (STSs), 9 cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs), two cinnamoyl-CoA reductases (CCRs), and two caffeate 3-O-methyltransferases (COMTs) (Figure 2e; see Additional File 6, Dataset S2)., The synthesis of resveratrol and its derivatives in berries by STSs is stimulated by stress factors such as fungal infection (mainly Botrytis cinerea), wounding, and UV light [53, 54]. However, it is becoming clear that higher levels of stilbenoid compounds and STS expression are also associated with the normal course of berry ripening in healthy and unstressed grapes [55–57]. Our data confirm that the increase in STS gene expression is likely to be a normal feature of grape ripening and distinguishes the ripening Corvina berries in typical climates from the unusual temperature in 2007 growing season. The same hold true for the expression behavior of PAL genes which are likely co-regulated with STSs during the biosynthesis of stilbenes, as previously reported [56, 58]., The differential expression of genes (CAD, CCR, and COMT) involved in the metabolism of hydroxycinnamic acids, precursors of many volatile odor compounds, supports the idea that the aromatic profile of ripe berry is strongly influenced by the temperature condition during the growing season [51, 59, 60]. Our conclusion is supported by the lower amount of stilbenes like resveratrol and its derivatives (viniferins) and hydroxycinnamic compounds detected in 2007 berries compared to the other years (see Additional File 7, Figure S2)., The 2008 season showed the least plasticity of gene expression among different vineyards (see Additional File 8, Figure S3). We therefore used this year to broaden the analysis to 11 different vineyards, and we found that approximately 5% of transcripts on the microarray were modulated when Corvina berries were ripened under different environmental conditions and using different agronomical practices (see Additional File 11, Dataset S4). The limited number of available studies comprehensively describing transcriptome plasticity in plants makes it difficult to evaluate the percentage of plastic genes in the Corvina transcriptome accurately, but based on our datasets we found that plastic genes represented approximately 18% of genes modulated during ripening in the 11 vineyards, suggesting that the environment and agricultural practices can have a profound impact on the berry transcriptome, in turn affecting ripe berry and wine quality traits. Interestingly, approximately 27% of the plastic transcripts were 'commonly expressed' (that is, expressed in all organs and tissues in the plant) in the recent grapevine transcriptomic atlas [33] whereas approximately 73% were expressed in >30 plant organs/tissues and none were specifically expressed in berry tissues, suggesting that the plasticity of gene expression in grapevine is a broad phenomenon and that data representing the berry pericarp could also be used to study plasticity in other organs., Many of the plastic genes (for example, ribosomal proteins and many other DNA/RNA metabolic process-related genes) we identified are worthy of further investigation to determine their specific impact on berry ripening parameters, for example, the modulation of ribosomal proteins suggests that transcriptome reprogramming during ripening involves a shift in protein synthesis (Figure 3a, b; see Additional File 11, Dataset S4 and Additional File 12, Figure S5). Although the regulation of ribosomal proteins in plants under different conditions has not been studied in detail, their modulation has been reported in response to various forms of abiotic stress including UV-B radiation [61], low temperatures [62, 63], wounding [64], ozone radiation [65], and salinity [66]. Other genes in the DNA/RNA metabolic process category were related to stress responses and recovery, which often affects the transcription and translation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors [67]. Our data strongly suggest that transcriptomic plasticity in developing Corvina berries is exerted predominantly by the broad reprogramming of genes that control the transcription and the rate of translation to remodel the cellular protein set., Interestingly, we also identified several plastic transcripts putatively involved in floral transition and flower organ identity. These included transcripts encoding two EARLY FLOWERING homologs, a CONSTANS protein, and transcription factors such as FRIGIDA-LIKE 2, SUPPRESSOR OF FRIGIDA 4, and SEPALLATA 3 (see Additional File 11, Dataset S4). Although most of these genes are believed to be functionally conserved in grapevine [68–70], their precise roles remain to be determined because the grapevine latent bud develops continuously and is therefore distinct from both the herbaceous flowers of Arabidopsis and rice and the woody perennial model of poplar. Many floral development genes are photoperiod-dependent in grapevine and may also play a role in bud dormancy [71]. The MADS box transcriptional factor SEPALLATA 3, and the grapevine homologs of CONSTANS and EARLY FLOWERING 4, are positively regulated during berry development [68] and may help to determine berry weight [23]. Because fruits represent the continued growth of the ovary, we propose that these floral regulators play a critical role in berry development and plasticity., Our analysis allowed us to define groups of vineyards sharing the expression profiles of common plastic genes (Figure 3d, e). Moreover, in some cases it was possible to link sets of differentially-expressed transcripts to particular environmental attributes or specific agronomical parameters (see Additional File 15, Figure S7a and S7b). Several heat-shock proteins have been found more expressed in Guyot-trained vines compared to the parral system. These genes have been detected as highly responsive to the microclimate changes around clusters [72]. Our data suggest that parrals are better shelters for berry clusters than replacement cane systems. Nevertheless, the inevitable absence of all possible combinations of environmental and agricultural parameters for plants cultivated in the open field means that our investigation could only provide an exploratory perspective rather than predictive interpretation., Differential gene expression in fully-ripe Corvina berries highlighted a deep metabolic difference among samples harvested in different locations (Figure 4; see Additional File 19, Figure S8). We found a positive correlation between transcriptomic data and ripening parameters (see Additional File 19, Figure S8d) confirming that plasticity affects the entire maturation process, therefore candidate genes representing such plasticity (that is, photosynthesis-related and secondary metabolism-related genes) could eventually be used for on-field monitoring., The large scale of our sampling procedure also allowed the identification of genes that were not plastic, that is, genes that were either constitutive or developmentally regulated but whose expression profiles were constant over the different vineyards and cultivation environments. Developmentally regulated but non-plastic genes (see Additional File 20, Dataset S9) included several positive and negative markers that have previously been identified as differentially-modulated transcripts during berry development in other seasons (2003 to 2006) and in other varieties (Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir) [43, 44, 46]. These could be developed into universal markers suitable for the monitoring of grape ripening in the field, regardless of cultivar and environment. The constitutive non-plastic genes we identified (see Additional File 22, Dataset S10) add to the list of constitutive housekeeping that can be used as references during quantitative gene expression analysis, and have been validated by comparison with the recent grapevine atlas of gene expression [33]., Climate change is expected to significantly impact agriculture in the near future and poses serious threats, especially to those specialty crops, as grapevine, that are more valued for their secondary metabolites rather than for high yield. Phenotypic plasticity is believed to effectively buffer environmental extremes and maintain homeostasis of primary metabolism., Overall, we have used the grapevine genome sequence [24] and the NimbleGen microarray platform to map the Corvina berry transcriptome and determine which genes are plastic (modulated in response to different environments) and which are non-plastic (regulated in the same manner regardless of the environment). This is the first major and comprehensive study to chart the plastic transcriptome in a woody perennial plant and our data therefore provide a reference model to explore genotype per environment interactions in fruit crops., These new findings, together with the earlier transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies focusing on the Corvina cultivar [25, 33, 45, 49, 50, 57, 73], provide a valuable platform to study the molecular processes underlying the complex development of grape berries and to identify environmentally-dependent and agriculturally-important traits which are essential for breeding new cultivars with improved adaptation to the environment. The methods used to establish our model provide a framework for the analysis of transcriptome plasticity in other crops as they respond to diverse environments and agricultural practices."

In contrast, there is a distinct lack of understanding regarding the distributions of the 5fC and 5caC modified sequences, largely due to a lack of accurate methods to detect these low-abundance modifications; mass spectroscopy indicates that 5fC is at 2% and 5caC at 0.5% of the levels of 5hmC in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which in turn is only 4% as abundant as 5mC [5]. Two recent studies report on novel techniques for mapping both 5fC and 5caC modifications, as well as addressing the functionality of TET/TDG 5mC oxidation events that occur throughout the genome [6, 7]. Through the use of highly specific antibodies raised against both 5fC and 5caC, researchers led by Yi Zhang at Harvard University are able to map the genome-wide distributions of both derivatives of 5hmC [6]. In an analogous set of experiments, Song and colleagues from the laboratory of Chuan He at the University of Chicago expand upon their already successful chemical capture techniques to enrich for 5hmC-marked DNA [7]. In short, by first modifying all endogenous 5hmC by glucosylation, they can then specifically reduce 5fC-marked cytosines to 5hmC through the addition of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and then glycosylate these sites with a modified glucose group (6-azide-glucose) to which a disulfide biotin linker is attached for subsequent enrichment. In addition, the group also adapt techniques to visualize the 5fC modification at single-base resolution (fCAB-seq), overcoming the issues of discrimination between the modified forms of cytosine that arise in traditional bisulfite-based mapping. By employing these novel techniques, both studies report the genome-wide patterns of 5fC, in addition to 5caC in the Zhang study, in wild-type (WT) mESCs [6, 7]. Typically sequence reads for both modifications are small in number in WT mESCs, consistent with a low abundance, but there is a suggestion of moderate levels of 5fC at repeat regions. The overall genomic distribution of 5fC and 5caC appears to be distinct from 5hmC in WT cells [6], but this view should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively fewer number of reads for 5fC and 5caC compared with 5hmC. Both studies recognized that enhancement of 5fC and 5caC levels in cells would improve data interpretation, so they derived similar biological strategies to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for their respective assay systems., As the 5fC and 5caC derivatives are believed to be committed for rapid removal by base excision repair-mediated mechanisms involving the protein TDG, the patterns of these two marks at steady state may not accurately reflect where demethylation is dynamically occurring in WT cells. To solve this problem the TDG protein was reduced to low levels either by short hairpin RNA interference [6] or through genetic manipulation in mESCs [7], to allow for the accumulation of both demethylation intermediates following TET-mediated oxidation of 5mC and 5hmC (Figure 1b). This increased the absolute levels of each modification and enhanced data quality and interpretation. Upon loss of TDG activity, many ectopic regions of 5fC and 5caC become apparent over genic and promoter-proximal regions; this contrasts with an earlier study that found 5fC enrichment in CpG islands (CGIs) of promoters and exons using a different assay technique [8]. The earlier study suggested CGI promoters, in which 5fC was relatively more enriched compared with 5mC or 5hmC, corresponded to transcriptionally active genes. In the present studies, upon relating the TDG-mediated changes of 5fC and 5caC to the transcriptional activities of associated genes, both groups suggest that TDG-mediated 5fC/5caC excision occurs preferentially at transcriptionally inactive promoters, implying a potential inhibitory role for the oxidative products at promoter proximal regions. No doubt these differing views will be amicably resolved in the future., Many of the ectopic 5fC and 5caC peaks were found to correspond to regions bound by transcription factors such as Oct4 and Nanog, which themselves play key roles in the maintenance of pluripotency, as well as at sites of Polycomb-group protein binding. These results imply that TET/TDG-mediated 5mC oxidation may be a key event in the targeting of chromatin modifying proteins and transcription factors to specific loci. Interestingly, both of the studies report that upon TDG reduction/removal, the majority of ectopic 5fC and 5caC is found at non-repetitive regions of the genome outside of promoters and exons, particularly over enhancer elements. After inhibition of TDG activity, the genomic distribution patterns of 5caC and 5fC are comparable with that of 5hmC, which was not so obvious for the WT cells [6]. Closer analysis reveals a strong enrichment for both 5fC and 5caC at poised (H3K4me1 but not H3K27ac marked) enhancer elements, implying that 5mC oxidation may be crucial for the priming of such regulatory regions. Comparison to transcription factor binding site data indicated that TDG-dependent regulation of 5fC occurs preferentially at Tet1-, Tet2-, p300- and CTCF-binding regions in mESCs [7]., As TET/TDG-mediated changes to cytosine modification states have now been shown to occur over a large number of genes and regulatory elements, this work reveals the potential for active DNA demethylation throughout the genome. Functionally, it is difficult to interpret how such modifications affect the overall epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of the cells. The relationship between transcriptional state and DNA demethylation appears to be a complex affair. Upon depletion of TDG, only a small proportion of genes actually change in their expression state (99 genes with P-values <0.01 and a fold change >1.5-fold; or 1,192 genes with P-values <0.01 alone). In contrast, relative global changes in the levels of both 5fC and 5caC are extensive. Mass spectrometry analysis indicates that global levels of 5fC and 5caC increased by 5.6-fold and 8.4-fold, respectively, in response to TDG knockdown; 5mC and 5hmC levels were not altered [6]. Furthermore, ectopic peaks of 5fC and 5caC accumulate outside of promoters and enhancers, such as those at the 3′ ends of genes, at sites that do not align to annotated regions of TDG binding [9]. As such, other proteins may be able to facilitate the base excision repair of the oxidative products of 5mC/5hmC in the absence of TDG., In view of the low levels of these marks, it is impressive how comparable many of the conclusions are between the two studies, particularly as antibody-based methods of enrichment on low-abundance proteins and DNA modifications are challenging when compared with chemical capture based techniques (Figure 1b). Although semiquantitative, the relative enrichments of the modifications (particularly in TDG-depleted/knock-out cell lines) suggest that the marks may either be snapshots of active demethylation at key regulatory regions or 'memories' of recent transcription events. The impression is of a poised environment that is permissive for rapid transcription upon the binding of relevant factors, a feature that would be highly relevant to pluripotent cells undergoing developmentally induced reprogramming changes in response to signaling cascades. It will be interesting to determine the genome-wide patterns of both 5fC and 5caC in somatic samples containing globally higher levels of 5hmC modifications [10]. However, the data suggest that it will be a challenge to detect these low-abundance modifications in WT cells without first blocking endogenous base excision repair, but perhaps there are more surprises to come."

In this study, we present a novel method that integrates expression profiles, mutation effects, and systemic properties of mutated genes to identify novel cancer drivers. We applied our method to ovarian cancer samples and were able to identify putative drivers in the majority of carcinomas without mutations in known cancer genes, thus suggesting that it can be used as a complementary approach to find rare driver mutations that cannot be detected using frequency-based approaches., In recent years, the completion of dozens of high-throughput sequencing screenings of cancer genomes led to the identification of >10,000 genes that bear at least one non-synonymous mutation. The discovery of such a wealth of mutations that progressively accumulate in the cancer genome was to some extent surprising and substantiated the idea of tumours as evolutionary systems where most acquired variations are 'passenger' because they do not have any direct role in promoting cancer. These mutations are fixed in the cancer cell population owing to the presence in the same cells of 'driver' mutations that instead confer growth advantages [1]. The identification of the (few) driver mutations among the (many) passenger variants is therefore key to pinpoint genes and pathways that play an active role in cancer development and may be used as therapeutic targets. Unfortunately, the distinction between driver and passenger mutations is not straightforward, because of the high heterogeneity of the mutational landscape among and within cancer types [2]. One of the most widely used approaches to identify novel cancer genes (that is, genes that harbour driver mutations) measures the gene mutation frequency, relying on the assumption that genes that are important for the development of a certain cancer type are recurrently mutated in several tumours [2–17]. Frequency-based methods led to the detection of unexpectedly high mutation frequency of isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2, eventually linking these enzymes to the onset of leukaemia and glioma [12, 18]. They also contributed to better understand the genetic heterogeneity of cancer, leading to the observation that only few genes are mutated in the vast majority of tumour types, while most cancer genes are mutated at high frequency in one or few cancer types [19]. Also the analysis of pathways instead of genes contributed to reduce the heterogeneity of cancer mutational landscape, because often the de-regulation of cancer-associated pathways can occur through the mutations of different components [20]. Pathway analysis for example identified significant enrichment of mutations in BRCA1 and ATM pathways in breast cancer, and WNT and TGFβ signalling pathways in colorectal cancer [21]. Although these processes were already known to be involved in tumorigenesis [20], only a systematic approach led to assign a likely driver role to new pathway components. Following conceptually similar approaches, several groups have analysed the proteins encoded by cancer genes in the context of the human protein-protein interaction network and identified network modules that are significantly associated with mutations [22–24]. Network analysis showed that cancer genes encode proteins that are highly connected and central inside the network [25, 26]. This has been interpreted as a sign of fragility of cancer genes towards perturbations, because modifications of proteins at the crossroad of multiple biological processes are likely to have harmful consequences [27]. In addition to encoding highly connected and central proteins, cancer genes share also other systems-level properties (that is, global properties that do not strictly depend on the individual gene function) that distinguish them from the rest of human genes. For example, they tend to maintain only one single copy in the genome, which suggests an intrinsic sensitivity of cancer genes towards gene dosage imbalance [26]. Moreover, cancer genes mostly appeared at two time points in evolution: caretakers and tumour suppressors are ancient genes that have orthologs also in prokaryotes, while gatekeepers and oncogenes were acquired with metazoans [28]. This suggests that tumorigenesis may arise from the impairment of either very basic or regulatory processes [29]. The existence of properties that distinguish cancer genes from the rest of human genes may be used to discriminate between driver and passenger mutations because mutated genes that have properties similar to known cancer genes are, in principle, more likely to harbour driver mutations, particularly when the mutations alter the protein function. In the last years, several methods to predict damaging mutations have been developed taking into account the site conservation throughout evolution and the possible effects on protein structure, as well as on splice-sites and UTRs [30–34]. In this study we developed an integrative method that uses tumour, gene and mutation properties to eventually predict novel drivers. As a proof of principle we applied our selection procedure to a panel of >300 ovarian carcinoma patients and identified genes with a putative driver role in >70% of tumours with previously unknown genetic determinants., The central tenet of our study was that cancer driver mutations occur in genes with peculiar properties and, therefore, such properties can be used to identify novel cancer genes. For example we showed that cancer genes with an established driver role are usually expressed in the tissue where they are mutated, thus suggesting that mutations in genes that are not expressed are neutral or passenger. In support to our results, the vast majority of cancer somatic mutations have been shown to occur in genomic regions associated with repressive chromatin marks [72]. This indicates that indeed most cancer mutations are neutral and occur in transcription-silent regions of the genome., In addition to expression profiles, we analysed the evolutionary, genomics and network properties of genes mutated in 32 ovarian cancer carcinomas with previously unknown genetics determinants. These tumours constitute only a small fraction of ovarian carcinomas (approximately 10% of the initial set) since the large majority of affected individuals bear mutations in known cancer genes, in particular in TP53. Although cancer is usually the outcome of the alteration of several genes and multiple drivers are required for cancer progression [73], we reasoned that focusing on tumours with no mutation in known cancer genes could increase the chances to find novel drivers. Furthermore, this would also help identifying a possible cause of cancer onset and development also in tumours that harbour rare mutations. With our approach we were indeed able to find 56 putative cancer genes in >70% of previously uncharacterized tumours, thus significantly reducing the fraction of patients with unknown cancer determinants. In the vast majority of cases, at least one of the putative drivers exerts a function in pathways that are altered in ovarian cancer. This confirms that the high heterogeneity of the cancer mutational landscape is reduced when considering biological processes rather than single genes [19]., As a comparison with our method, we investigated whether the 56 putative cancer genes had also been detected in the original study on the same set of ovarian carcinomas [62], which also identified possible cancer genes using a variety of approaches, from gene mutation frequency to pathway and network analysis [62]. Our list of putative drivers showed very poor overlap with the genes identified in the original study, mainly because the latter were for the vast majority already known cancer genes or had no expression data, and were therefore discarded from our analysis. Interestingly, some overlap existed between our list of 56 drivers and the network modules that were significantly mutated in ovarian cancer [24]. In particular, we identified five genes in common between the two lists. The silencing via RNA interference of three of these five genes (VAV1, TAF12 and GTF3) resulted in increased proliferation in at least 10 ovarian cancer cell lines. This strongly suggests a role of tumour suppression of these genes, and this is worth further experimental investigation., Our analysis showed that the integration of several sources of information allows the identification of rare cancer genes. This may be of particular utility in tumours with no known driver mutations or where frequency-based methods cannot be applied. However, we also showed that an integrated analysis may be useful for the identification of mutated genes that may cooperate in promoting tumour development. The poor overlap with previous findings in the same set of tumour samples demonstrates that our approach is complementary to frequency-based methods. The integration of several methods based upon different theoretical assumptions may therefore result in a better and more complete characterization of the mutational landscape of cancer."

Here, we explain some key aspects of machine learning that make it useful for genome annotation, with illustrative examples from ENCODE., The complete sequencing of the human genome marked an important milestone in modern biology [1, 2], but it also produced a whole new set of challenges in elucidating the functions and interactions of different parts of the genome. A natural first step to tackling these formidable tasks is to construct an annotation of the genome, which is to (1) identify all functional elements in the genome, (2) group them into element classes such as coding genes, non-coding genes and regulatory modules, and (3) characterize the classes by some concrete features such as sequence patterns. Over the years, many experimental and computational methods have been invented to accelerate this annotation process. Among the popular computational methods are those based on the concept of machine learning (Box 1). Originally a branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been fruitfully applied to a variety of domains. The basic idea of machine learning is to construct a mathematical model for a particular concept (an element class in the case of genome annotation) based on its features in some observed data. The model can then be applied to identify new instances of the concept in other data [3–5]., In this review, we discuss some key properties of machine learning that make it useful for genome annotation, using some classic problems for illustration. We also describe some examples in the latest work of the ENCODE Project Consortium [6] to highlight some recent trends. We focus on the identification and classification of genomic elements, and do not go into the details of machine learning approaches to functional annotation, such as the predictions of gene expression, gene functions and protein interactions. In addition, due to limited space, we can only include a small portion of the related references in the literature. Readers interested in the application of machine learning in some major classes of genomic elements are referred to the corresponding reviews listed in Table 1. This review is intended to serve as an introduction to machine learning and its use in genome annotation for a general audience, requiring no prior knowledge in these topics. A more general description of the use of machine learning in bioinformatics can be found in Baldi and Brunak [4]. More formal discussions on machine learning can be found in various text books [5, 7, 8]. An overview of experimental and computational genome annotation approaches can be found in some other reviews [9, 10].Table 1

                            Cis-regulatory binding modules[11–13][14–16][17, 18][19, 20][21–24][25, 26], An ultimate goal of genome annotation is to identify all types of functional elements and all their occurrences in a genome. How far are we from this goal? Currently there are still likely undiscovered genomic element classes given the rapid discovery of new classes (such as many non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)) in recent years. Some element classes also have so far very few discovered instances. In terms of machine learning, these two facts imply that currently it is impossible to perform purely supervised learning for all element classes. As a result, in a recent work by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project Consortium, which aims at delineating all functional elements encoded in the human genome [70], several different approaches have been adopted to confront this grand challenge., ENCODE has recently produced about 1,600 sets of whole-genome experimental data that cover many types of molecular states and activities, including transcription, long-range DNA interactions, and chromatin features such as histone modifications, protein-DNA binding and open chromatin signals [6]. In one approach to whole-genome annotation, the experimental data were used to perform unsupervised segmentation of the human genome [6, 71, 72], so that each genomic location was assigned to a segment. The segments were then grouped into clusters in an unsupervised manner. Each resulting cluster was described by the characteristic features of its members. Surprisingly, although the clusters were discovered by an unsupervised procedure, many of them have simple interpretations corresponding to known genomic element classes such as promoters, transcribed regions and enhancers. The segmentation was also able to provide sub-classes of particular element classes, such as enhancers with strong and weak activities in particular cell types, respectively. In general, this method can reveal groups of sequence elements according to the observed data alone without defining the target element classes a priori., One difficulty in performing this unsupervised clustering was to determine the number of clusters to produce. Having too few clusters would merge elements from different genomic element classes together, while having too many clusters would make the results difficult to interpret. In order to avoid manually defining the number of clusters, in another approach the segments were put onto a two-dimensional toroidal map, where similar segments were put close to each other using the unsupervised Self-Organizing Map method [73]. The resulting map provides a way to study the relationships between different segments and the meanings of each local region on the map without defining the number of clusters and the cluster boundaries [6]. It also provides information about the similarity between different clusters identified by the segmentation method., The whole-genome segmentation approach has the advantage of requiring no a priori definition of element classes, so that the discovery process is directly based on the observed data. On the other hand, when there is a specific type of genomic elements of interest, customized methods could potentially include more information specific to it. As an example, one important effort of ENCODE was to experimentally validate computationally predicted enhancers using different types of reporter assays [6]. A number of methods had previously been proposed for identifying enhancers in a genome, including both supervised [74, 75] and unsupervised [76, 77] methods. These methods were constrained by a lack of whole-genome experimental data, and had thus relied on either a relatively small set of experimental features or static information such as genomic sequence and evolutionary conservation. Correspondingly, a specialized pipeline was designed by ENCODE to identify enhancers at the genome scale, utilizing the large amount of experimental data produced [6, 78]. Both the predictions from the segmentation approach and the enhancer prediction pipeline were found to achieve reasonable levels of accuracy [6]., Based on the ENCODE experience, one could imagine a potential hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both the unsupervised and supervised approaches described above. First, the segmentation approach is applied to systematically discover genomic element classes from large datasets. Specialized supervised methods can then be designed to provide detailed modeling of each element class using extra domain knowledge and auxiliary data available., We conclude by discussing some current challenges in applying machine learning to genome annotation and the corresponding outstanding key research problems., We first consider a basic setting of machine learning for binary classification, and later describe variations of it commonly encountered in genome annotation. Suppose we want to identify enhancers in a genome. We divide up the genome into a list of genomic regions X = (x
                1, x
                2, ..., x
                N
                ). Each region x
                i
                 has a corresponding binary label y
                i
                , where y
                i
                 = 1 if x
                i
                 is an enhancer, and y
                i
                 = 0 if not. Each region is described by a set of features x
                i
                 = (x
                i
                1, x
                i
                2, ..., x
                im
                ). For example, x
                i
                1 could be the evolutionary conservation of x
                i
                 among several close species, x
                i
                2 could be the average ChIP-seq [27, 28] signal of the active enhancer mark H3K27ac (histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation) among the bases within the region from a certain experiment, and so on. The goal of machine learning is to find a function f (called a model) such that f(x
                i
                ) is close to y
                i
                , that is, to tell if a region is an enhancer from some observed features alone., To find a suitable f, we need to (1) decide on a mathematical form of f; (2) find known positive and negative examples that can help estimate the parameters of f; and (3) actually estimate the parameters of f, in a way that it likely predicts the labels of regions accurately, even for regions for which the corresponding labels are unknown., For task 1, many families of f and their corresponding algorithms for learning the parameters have been studied. The popular ones include artificial neural networks [29], Bayesian networks [30], decision trees [31], k-nearest neighbors [32], random forests [33] and support vector machines [34]. They differ in the form and complexity of their models. Some examples are shown in Figure 1. Predictions are made based on the mathematical form of f and the parameters learned from the examples, such as the location of orientation of the decision surface of a SVM (Figure 1a)., Task 2 could be quite tricky for some element classes (see the corresponding discussions in the main text). Task 3 can be further sub-divided into two sub-tasks, that of finding a model to fit the training examples, and of ensuring the model to be able to predict the labels of unseen regions correctly. The first sub-task can be achieved by finding parameter values of f that minimize a loss function, such as the sum of squared errors of the n examples, 
                    . Since the parameter values are determined according to the observed data, the process is described as 'learning' a model from the data. The second sub-task is achievable only if one makes certain assumptions about the models and examples. It is usually assumed that the observed examples and unobserved instances of each type of functional elements share the same distribution of feature values, and that when two models can fit the observed examples equally well, the simpler one (for example, one with a smaller number of parameters or a smaller total magnitude of the parameter values) is likely to generalize better to unobserved instances. A model too specific to the observed data, usually characterized by a high complexity of the model, may over-fit the data; that is, may capture patterns that are only true for the observed examples. To avoid over-fitting, some machine learning methods control the complexity of the models by model pruning [35] or regularization [3], with the observed examples fitting less well to the model as a tradeoff. Some other methods produce multiple models on different subsets of data to identify reliable patterns that appear frequently in these models (see main text for more discussions). Procedure-wise, over-fitting is detected by building a model based on a subset of the examples (the training set), and evaluating its accuracy based on another subset not involved in training (the testing set). An over-fitted model would have good training accuracy but poor testing accuracy. The process is usually repeated with different portions of data treated as the training set in turn to compute the average accuracy in a cross-validation procedure."

These biases impair scientific and medical applications. Accordingly, we have developed computational methods for discovering, describing and measuring bias., We applied these methods to the Illumina, Ion Torrent, Pacific Biosciences and Complete Genomics sequencing platforms, using data from human and from a set of microbes with diverse base compositions. As in previous work, library construction conditions significantly influence sequencing bias. Pacific Biosciences coverage levels are the least biased, followed by Illumina, although all technologies exhibit error-rate biases in high- and low-GC regions and at long homopolymer runs. The GC-rich regions prone to low coverage include a number of human promoters, so we therefore catalog 1,000 that were exceptionally resistant to sequencing. Our results indicate that combining data from two technologies can reduce coverage bias if the biases in the component technologies are complementary and of similar magnitude. Analysis of Illumina data representing 120-fold coverage of a well-studied human sample reveals that 0.20% of the autosomal genome was covered at less than 10% of the genome-wide average. Excluding locations that were similar to known bias motifs or likely due to sample-reference variations left only 0.045% of the autosomal genome with unexplained poor coverage., The assays presented in this paper provide a comprehensive view of sequencing bias, which can be used to drive laboratory improvements and to monitor production processes. Development guided by these assays should result in improved genome assemblies and better coverage of biologically important loci.","","Ideal whole-genome shotgun DNA sequencing would distribute reads uniformly across the genome and without sequence-dependent variations in quality. All existing sequencing technologies fall short of this ideal and exhibit various types and degrees of bias. Sequencing bias degrades genomic data applications, including genome assembly and variation discovery, which rely on genome-wide coverage. Undercovered regions might lead to a missed SNP in an important region or cause an assembler to produce shorter contigs. For example, Figure 1 plots the coverage of the transcription start site and first exon of human gene NCS1, which encodes a neurotransmitter regulator [1], in whole-genome shotgun sequencing (data set A2). Despite 198-fold mean coverage of the genome, the first 72 bases of this exon are completely uncovered. This type of bias can reduce the effectiveness of biological and medical research. Recently published work on drug-resistant tuberculosis identified thousands of zero-coverage sites in an entire class of the bacterium's genes, despite sequencing to an average depth of 134× [2]. Alleviating gaps or dips in coverage through additional reads inflates sequencing costs, and may have limited effectiveness. For these reasons, improving our knowledge of sequencing bias is essential to improving the utility of DNA sequencing data.

The first 72 bases of the first exon of human gene NCS1, including the transcription start site, were uncovered in a 198× whole-genome shotgun data set (#A2). The displayed 2,000 base region is chromosome 9:132,933,910-132,935,910. NCS1 encodes calcium-binding proteins that regulate neurotransmitter release [1].
                    , Our goal in this work was to develop a rigorous method for discovering and monitoring coverage and error biases, then to apply it to data from a wide range of sequencing platforms (Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM, Pacific Biosciences RS, and the Complete Genomics sequencing service). This study complements previous work in the field [3–7]., Bias manifests in multiple ways. Coverage bias is a deviation from the uniform distribution of reads across the genome. Similarly, error bias is a deviation from the expectation of uniform mismatch, insertion, and deletion rates in reads across the genome. This paper focuses primarily on coverage bias because it is the most damaging sequencing failure., Sequencing technologies are vulnerable to multiple sources of bias. Methods based on bacterial cloning and Sanger-chemistry sequencing [8] were subject to many coverage-reducing biases, notably at GC extremes, palindromes, inverted repeats, and sequences toxic to the bacterial host [9–17]. Illumina sequencing [18] has been shown to lose coverage in regions of high or low GC [19–22], a phenomenon also seen in other 'next-generation' technologies [3, 6]. PCR amplification during library construction is a known source of undercoverage of GC-extreme regions [20, 21] and similar biases may also be introduced during bridge PCR for cluster amplification on the Illumina flowcell [23]. Illumina strand-specific errors can lead to coverage biases by impairing aligner performance [24]. Ion Torrent [25], like 454 [26], utilizes a terminator-free chemistry that may limit its ability to accurately sequence long homopolymers [4, 27, 28], and may also be sensitive to coverage biases introduced by emulsion PCR in library construction. Complete Genomics [29] also uses amplification along with a complex library construction process. The Pacific Biosciences [30] process is amplification-free; therefore, one might expect it to exhibit lower levels of coverage bias than the other technologies., In addition to sources in the wet lab, bias can be introduced by any of the computational steps in the sequencing pipeline. Signal-processing and base calling limitations could result in under-representation or increased error rates in some locations, as can inaccurate alignment. An inaccurate reference or sample-reference differences can cause coverage or accuracy variations that may be misdiagnosed as sequencing bias. Therefore, detecting bias is only the first step and must be followed by more detailed experiments to assign responsibility to the library preparation, sequencing, or computational stages., We employ two methodologies for measuring bias. Per-base bias measurements, which rely on deep-coverage sequencing, are hypothesis-free and ideal for discovering new types of bias. Motif bias measurements, which require only shallow-coverage sequencing, are ideal for comparisons across experimental conditions and for monitoring ongoing sequencing pipeline performance at known bias-prone sequence contexts and locations. Bias motif monitoring plays a useful role by providing a critical metric in determining and ameliorating the sources of sequencing bias. Together these methodologies can be used to compare platforms, to measure the utility of combining data from multiple platforms, and to determine the extent to which coverage bias is described by the statistics of known motifs., Sequencing vendors and individual investigators alike strive to improve the quality of their data. This includes increasing read length, yield, overall base quality, and other average measures that reflect the behavior of the technology on 'typical' parts of the genome. However, such measures do not tell us how the technology performs on the 'hardest' parts of the genome, where data quality is lowest, and this is a critical omission. For example, as we have noted, in many human data sets there are large numbers of transcription start sites and first exons with essentially no coverage, and although this bias affects only a tiny fraction of the genome, it is of fundamental importance to the utility of the data., A goal of our work has been to develop a systematic methodology for assaying coverage bias. We note the following key components of our approach., Use of multiple microbial samples to assess bias: these samples span diverse sequence contexts and have finished reference sequences, thus facilitating analyses that expose 'extreme' regions on which performance is subpar. Their genomes are small and thus can be economically sequenced to high coverage., Bias assessment on the human genome: because of its size and complexity, it spans even more diverse sequence contexts than the microbial samples. Conversely, although we used the highly studied sample NA12878, we note the lack of a truly finished sample-specific reference sequence that would facilitate definitive undercoverage analyses., Formulation of a menagerie of 'bad' motifs: these encode known trouble spots, including high and low GC but also less well-known motifs, such as ATAT... runs. GC-bias plots effectively encode a whole family of motifs, one for each GC percentage. Motifs, especially on large genomes such as human, can be economically assayed using low-coverage data., Use of relative coverage as the metric for coverage bias: whether assaying the whole genome or only motifs, relative coverage, as in Tables 2 and 3, simplifies and clarifies bias measurement., We generated data from several technologies and applied this approach. We note the clear edge of single-molecule data from Pacific Biosciences, and that among the amplification-based technologies, data from Illumina had the lowest bias. However, our results represent a performance snapshot, and are exquisitely sensitive to the fine details of laboratory process (including library construction and sequencing), which we anticipate will continue to be improved. For example, we compared several methods of library construction and, within fixed protocols, noted assay variability arising from process fluctuation. We emphasize the ongoing importance of such process monitoring as a prerequisite for meaningful inferences about protocol improvements. Our experiences lead to the general conclusion that a platform's sequencing bias is not an immutable property. Although Ion Torrent's platform generally suffered from the most bias, reagent, protocol, and computational changes may lead to future improvements., Bias in read accuracy (and not just coverage) is also important. It is well known that some loci on the genome sequence badly. Often this behavior is associated with polymerase slippage. In this work we defined assays, like those for coverage bias, which can be used to track error bias, and evaluated these assays on the same data sets used for coverage bias., We note that bias is far from the only important metric for sequencing platform evaluation. Users must also evaluate accuracy, throughput, cost, speed, and many other factors when choosing the appropriate platform for an experiment. Indeed, there is no universal 'best' platform for every purpose., Taken together, coverage and error bias assays provide a comprehensive view of bias in sequence data. We note several avenues for future work. First, the assays can be used to drive laboratory improvements, with the goal of minimizing bias. Second, the assays can be used to monitor intentional and unintentional process changes that might affect bias. Third, the assay genomes and our knowledge of them might be improved. In particular, it would be of great value to have an ultra-high-quality reference sequence for an available human sample. Fourth, the motifs might be refined and added to with the goal of creating as comprehensive and informative a list of bias-prone contexts as possible. Collectively these advances could improve data quality, thus increasing the accuracy and contiguity of genome assemblies and minimizing the likelihood that biologically important loci will be poorly represented in sequence data."

              , DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is the prototypical mode of epigenetic regulation, enabling stable but reversible gene repression. DNA methylation is highly dynamic in early embryonic development, with a near-complete erasure after fertilization, followed by a wave of de novo methylation around the time of implantation. As development progresses and lineage choice decisions are made, many loci undergo cell-type-specific DNA methylation changes, as the chosen gene expression programs are fixed [1]. Thereafter, DNA methylation is thought to be highly stable, except during oncogenic transformation, where methylation is well known to be highly aberrant [2]. With the current surge of interest in stem cell biology, the question arises as to how, and to what degree, DNA methylation during stem cell differentiation can influence lineage fate decisions, which represent developmental decisions that continue to occur throughout adult life. Understanding how DNA methylation changes between somatic progenitors and their progeny could lend insight into the mechanisms of development and epigenetic regulation. With the advent of large-scale, genome-wide bisulfite sequencing, the generation of DNA methylation profiles of purified cell populations at single-base resolution has been facilitated. A study by Kaaij et al. in this issue of Genome Biology [3] is the first to examine at high resolution the methylation changes that take place during the differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), a well-characterized somatic stem cell population., Utilizing a transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP) mouse line that fluorescently labels the ISC population and its downstream progeny with graded levels of fluorescence [4], Kaaij et al. [3] isolated ISCs as GFPhigh (stem cells in the base of the intestinal crypt), transit amplifying cells as GFPlow (rapidly dividing cells moving up the intestinal crypt), and terminally differentiated (villus) populations in order to capture the differentiation hierarchy. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was then performed on each of the three isolated intestinal cell populations. The generation of this dataset alone is significant, as genome-wide studies to deduce the impact of DNA methylation on normal differentiation of adult somatic tissue systems are relatively recent and few in number [5–7]., Surprisingly, WGBS revealed only minor alterations in DNA methylation during the differentiation from an ISC to the mature progeny of the intestinal villus. Of the few differentially methylated regions (DMRs) observed during differentiation, most were in loci identified by histone marks as gene-regulatory domains, specifically enhancers. The vast majority of these DMRs (43/50) were found to lose methylation during differentiation. The authors confirmed that a number of the hypomethylated DMRs physically interact with genes upregulated upon differentiation, suggesting that there is a mechanistic link between altering DNA methylation status and the progression of differentiation. The remaining seven DMRs exhibited hypermethylation upon differentiation, but these shifts did not correlate with changes in gene expression. These findings, combined with the observed low expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) in ISCs, led the authors to propose that de novo DNA methylation is not relevant in ISC differentiation., The limited number and direction of DNA methylation changes that Kaaij et al. observed were unexpected in the context of previous studies on embryonic stem cell (ESC) and somatic progenitor cell differentiation. In a study of genome-wide DNA methylation changes of ESCs undergoing differentiation to neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro, the majority of CpGs with differential methylation gained methylation, with approximately 8% of CpGs gaining and only approximately 2% of CpGs losing methylation; this suggests active de novo methylation activity during ESC differentiation [8]., In the mouse hematopoietic system, which has a well-described hierarchy of stem, progenitor and differentiated cells, relatively homogenous cell populations can be purified and analyzed for their methylation patterns. In recent studies using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) or comprehensive high-throughput arrays for relative methylation (CHARM), hematopoietic progenitors and their differentiated progeny were found to exhibit a large degree of differential methylation, which correlated with lineage-specific gene expression changes [5, 6]. In addition, application of WGBS to human hematopoietic progenitors showed that they possess partially methylated regions, believed to be similar in function to poised bivalent domains in ESCs. These sites of intermediate methylation were then found to either gain or lose methylation in B cells, and vice versa in neutrophils, suggesting that the DNA methylation changes were lineage specific [7]. Moreover, a role for de novo methylation during hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation was directly shown using conditional knockout mice, in which the differentiation of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs was significantly impeded after bone marrow transplantation. RRBS analysis showed that Dnmt3a functions, at least in part, to ensure the stem cell program is shut down during differentiation [9]., While not all of the above-described studies used highly purified populations, and the resolution of the methylation profiling could be improved, the overall message that hematopoietic differentiation is accompanied by dynamic methylation changes is likely to prevail. Additionally, DNA methylation changes accompanying somatic stem cell differentiation are not limited to the hematopoietic system, but have been readily found within the skin lineage differentiation program. RRBS analysis of skin progenitors and their mature progeny identified over 1,700 DMRs that either gained (269 regions) or lost (1487 regions) methylation during differentiation [5]. This is quite distinct from the very limited changes in the intestine reported by Kaaij and colleagues. Furthermore, the previously described RRBS analysis of in vivo hematopoietic and skin progenitors and their progeny found a number of shared DMRs that either gained (258) or lost (248) methylation during differentiation [5] that was significantly larger than the total number of DMRs found during ISC differentiation (50) [3]. A number of these shared DMRs were characterized by both open chromatin signatures and DNAase-hypersensitive sites found in other lineages (brain, heart and kidney), leading to a prediction of shared epigenetic regulatory patterns between somatic stem cell populations undergoing differentiation [5]. While the possibility of such overarching patterns is enticing, further characterization of other somatic stem cell populations at high resolution and stem cell purity is still required. Studies at a depth comparable to that of this article will be necessary to make such generalizations confidently., This study by Kaaij et al. [3] stands out as one of few to examine genome-wide DNA methylation changes in normal cells directly isolated from fresh tissue as opposed to after in vitro culture. This approach avoids the potentially confounding result of aberrant DNA methylation from in vitro culture, which has been shown to lead to gradual hypermethylation [8]. With such a tiny number of identified methylation changes, however, one has to conjecture whether the authors could have missed something. One potential caveat is in the approach the authors used to isolate intestinal cell populations, which might lead to some heterogeneity in the cell populations examined. While GFPhigh cells in this transgenic mouse have been shown to represent pure stem cell populations [4], there is a greater degree of heterogeneity within the villus-defined population. The villus, while comprising primarily absorptive enterocytes (approximately 90%), also contains mucosecreting goblet cells and various subtypes of enteroendocrine cells (approximately 1%) [10]. This heterogeneity could possibly dampen the ability to identify subtle methylation differences among the cell populations analyzed, but is unlikely to change the overall conclusions., In addition, the authors posit that, owing to both low expression of de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and the predominance of hypomethylated DMRs, active de novo methylation might not serve an important role in differentiation of the small intestine. Could DNA methylation changes, however, influence the decision between secretory or absorptive cell types, similar to the influence DNA methylation has on myeloid versus lymphoid fate decisions [6, 7]? In addition, the analysis of adult intestinal somatic stem cell differentiation does not preclude a possible role for de novo DNA methylation earlier in intestinal development. It might be worthwhile examining both methylation and gene expression changes between purified, mature intestinal cell populations sourced at different developmental time-points to address these questions., Overall, this study is a valuable addition to the growing body of data uncovering roles for DNA methylation in the differentiation of known normal somatic stem cells. With some similarities, but more differences, to other somatic stem cell populations previously studied, future studies will be needed to discern whether common epigenetic changes during somatic stem cell differentiation exist, and to test how such distinctions influence the specific differentiation process of the stem cells of each tissue system."
"127","Genomic triumph meets clinical reality","Qasim Ayub, Yali Xue, Chris Tyler-Smith","The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus","Chris Tyler-Smith","cts@sanger.ac.uk","28 May 2013","","","A report on the 'Genomic Disorders 2013: from 60 years of DNA to human genomes in the clinic' meeting, held at Homerton College, Cambridge, UK, April 10-12, 2013., Generating sequence data no longer appears to be a major technological challenge. Apart from the complex repetitive regions of the genome, we are able to produce good genome or exome sequences from large numbers of individuals. This success, however, generates its own problems: petabytes of data. Storing and analyzing datasets of this size is a new challenge for geneticists, made more complex because genotype or sequence datasets, themselves large, often need to be linked to phenotype datasets, potentially much larger and more complex. The consensus at the meeting seemed to be that these issues were currently manageable, but the future was uncertain and considerable efforts would be needed to manage the ever-increasing datasets being produced., Having generated basic sequence data, variants need to be identified. The sheer numbers of variants - three to four million per genome - and the complexity of calling indels and structural variants remain challenging. Although there are well-established ways of calling SNPs, Daniel MacArthur and Monkol Lek (Massachusetts General Hospital, USA) made the case that joint calling of thousands of genomes substantially improves variant calls by increasing the number of true positives and reducing the number of false positives. This, however, requires access to the thousands of genomes that will be used, and thus data sharing, a topic we return to below., With a set of reasonably reliable variants, we then need to understand their likely functional impact. We understand variants that disrupt protein-coding genes quite well, but these make up only a tiny proportion of the functional variants in any genome. Variants in the 'extraordinary range of overlapping and interlacing' intronic, intergenic, antisense, long non-coding and microRNAs, described by John Mattick (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Australia), are likely to be functionally important but almost all are poorly understood. The task of understanding functional significance may be even more difficult for structural variants that affect large genomic regions, although we are beginning to make some headway in understanding the mutational processes involved in complex genome rearrangements (Jim Lupski, Baylor College of Medicine, USA)., Large-scale projects like ENCODE attempt systematic functional annotation of both coding and non-coding regions (Ewan Birney, European Bioinformatics Institute, UK). These non-coding functional variants are not just of research interest. Michael Weedon (University of Exeter, UK) reported that a common cause of pancreatic agenesis (absence of the pancreas) was disruption of an enhancer element 25 kb downstream of the PTF1A gene by point mutation or deletion. Malte Spielmann (Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany) described two deletions and a translocation that removed barrier elements and allowed inappropriate expression of PITX1, leading to homeotic transformation of the arm to a leg, manifesting as Liebenberg syndrome. These rare examples of successful identification of severe causative non-coding variants illustrate both the difficulties of such analyses and the importance of further work in this area., Clinicians in the past have been faced with a phenotype, and sought its genetic basis: the causative genetic variant. Now, they are more and more often faced with a genome sequence and the need to predict the health consequences of the variants it carries. This is rather different, even when high-quality annotation is available, because of incomplete, or reduced, penetrance: some individuals will not develop a disease, even though they carry the variant associated with that trait. The full extent of incomplete penetrance is only just being appreciated, in part as genome sequencing is revealing that apparently healthy individuals in the general population each carry approximately 500 protein-damaging variants, approximately 80 in the homozygous state, and two known to cause disease, as reported by the authors (Chris Tyler-Smith, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK). More direct studies of incomplete penetrance have been carried out using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Ben Lehner (EMBL-CRG Systems Biology and ICREA Centre for Genomic Regulation, Spain) demonstrated that the distribution of a phenotypic trait can vary widely among genetically identical mutant worms. Much of this phenotypic variation could be understood as a consequence of variable expression of a paralogous gene, which when highly expressed partially compensated for the mutation, and of a chaperone protein. Such detailed analyses illustrate the potential for deeper molecular understanding of variable penetrance in humans, and possibly identifying novel directions for future therapy., Perhaps the liveliest sections of the meeting were those that debated the issues of informed consent for research subjects and the sharing of genetic and phenotypic information. Johan den Dunnen (Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands) made a passionate appeal for the sharing of data, which found wide support. One clinician remarked that the first thing he wanted to know when he discovered a candidate causal mutation in a patient was the phenotype of other carriers. Yet according to current practices, such sharing of information is usually difficult or effectively impossible, with ethical considerations often cited as the barrier. There may be a mismatch between ethicists' and clinicians' caution and the expectations of patients, with patients and their relatives sometimes struggling to understand why their data are not used by the doctors who hold it to help others., Some of the complexities of reporting genetic findings, either targeted or incidental, back to individuals were discussed by Robert C Green (Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, USA), including a randomized controlled trial of the impact of genome sequencing, the MedSeq Project, and the thinking behind the recent American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations to return certain incidental findings to patients, whether or not the patient expects this. The ClinSeq study (Leslie Biesecker, National Institutes of Health, USA) is investigating the consequences of returning clinically relevant results from exome sequencing to suitably consented patients, illuminating both their reactions and the variable penetrance of some 'disease' variants, as discussed above. An aspect that was briefly touched upon was that the disclosure of incidental genetic risks discovered in children could limit their future options in ways that they had not themselves consented to. The ethical debate is far from over, but can now be conducted with the benefit of some data., We are in an era of medical-genomic projects of ever-increasing scale: the meeting heard reports from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders rare disease study (Margriet van Kogelenberg and Daniel A King, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the UK10K Project (Nicole Soranzo, The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK), the SardiNIA Medical Sequencing Discovery Project (Gonçalo Abecasis, University of Michigan, USA), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project (Daniel MacArthur, Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; Gonçalo Abecasis, University of Michigan, USA), and even early-stage plans to move next-generation sequencing into the clinic by sequencing 100,000 phenotyped individuals to guide treatment of cancer and diagnosis of rare disorders (Tim Hubbard, Department of Health, UK)., The genomic revolution has thus begun filtering through to clinics. It has already led to improvements in diagnosis and choice of treatment. More directly, antisense RNA clinical trials are beginning to tackle rare intractable Mendelian disorders that are caused by defects in single genes with large effect sizes. Clinical outcomes, everyone hopes and expects, will gradually improve as we unravel the complexity of genome biology. But we should bear in mind the report of Jennifer J Lentz (LSU Health Sciences Center, USA) that patients with type 1 Usher syndrome, which leads to combined deafness and blindness, would welcome treatment for the blindness, but do not consider that their deafness needs intervention. Progress must reflect a dialog between all involved: researchers, clinicians and most of all patients."

Previous genome-wide studies identified numerous differentially methylated regions upon differentiation of stem cells, many of them associated with transcriptional start sites., We present the first genome-wide, single-base-resolution view into DNA methylation dynamics during differentiation of a mammalian epithelial stem cell: the mouse small intestinal Lgr5+ stem cell. Very little change was observed at transcriptional start sites and our data suggest that differentiation-related genes are already primed for expression in the stem cell. Genome-wide, only 50 differentially methylated regions were identified. Almost all of these loci represent enhancers driving gene expression in the differentiated part of the small intestine. Finally, we show that binding of the transcription factor Tcf4 correlates with hypo-methylation and demonstrate that Tcf4 is one of the factors contributing to formation of differentially methylated regions., Our results reveal limited DNA methylation dynamics during small intestine stem cell differentiation and an impact of transcription factor binding on shaping the DNA methylation landscape during differentiation of stem cells in vivo.","Adult stem cells, Differentiation, DNA Methylation, Methylome, Enhancer, Tcf4","DNA methylation is of critical importance for proper development. Mutants in any of the enzymes responsible for this mark are lethal [1]. The mammalian DNA methylation machinery can be subdivided into two categories: DNA methylation maintenance by DNMT1 and de-novo DNA methylation by DNMT3a/b [2]. The combination of bisulfite treatment and high throughput sequencing (BS-Seq) made it possible to assess the dynamics of DNA methylation during differentiation and other processes on the single nucleotide level. Initial single nucleotide resolution genome wide studies both in vitro and in vivo established the inverse relationship between methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 and DNA methylation at the transcriptional start site (TSS), but also at intergenic regions [3, 4]. Furthermore, transcription factor (TF) binding sites were found to be often hypo-methylated [4]. These studies gave the first hints to what shapes the DNA methylation landscape during differentiation., DNA methylation dynamics at TSSs during in-vitro differentiation of both embryonic stem cell and progenitor cells to differentiated cells has previously been investigated using MeDIP combined with microarray hybridization. In these studies, depending on the differentiation step, somewhere between 66 and >1,000 TSSs displayed differential DNA methylation levels [5, 6]. As expected, the gain in DNA methylation often negatively correlated with gene expression levels [5, 6]. The first genome-wide BS-seq studies focusing on differentiation of stem cells addressed ES cell (ESC) differentiation in vitro [3, 4]. These studies revealed that upon differentiation large hypo-methylated regions are formed and many TSSs change their methylation status, reflecting their activation or inactivation during the differentiation process. Later studies focused on the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. These studies identified numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) upon differentiation, many of them associated with transcriptional start sites (TSS) [4, 7, 8]. In the hematopoietic system a subset of DMRs located at TSSs were in fact widening of already existing hypo-methylated regions [7]. Furthermore, hematopoietic differentiation is impaired in Dnmt3a mutants [9], suggesting a role for de-novo DNA methylation during differentiation in this system. These studies have created a general picture in which stem cell differentiation is accompanied by substantial DNA methylation changes. It should however be kept in mind that the number of biological systems analyzed is still small and thus generalizing statements may still be premature. In fact, recent work by the Meissner lab, using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, has shown that during adult stem cell differentiation DNA methylation dynamics is more limited than expected (Bock et al., 2012). Still, this study reports on >2,000 significantly affected loci during skin stem cell differentiation. Finally, since it has been shown that in-vitro cultivation of cells can rapidly induce changes in DNA methylation patters [3], it is important to note that the Bock et al. and Hodges et al. studies are thus far the only studies addressing DNA methylation dynamics at single base resolution during differentiation in a completely in-vivo setting [7, 10]., We therefore sought to study DNA methylation dynamics in an epithelial stem cell system that is well characterized, displays high stem cell activity, is medically relevant and can be studied completely in vivo. Currently, there are only very few systems that satisfy all these criteria simultaneously. We chose to study the mouse small intestinal epithelium. The mouse SI can be divided into three regions: a lower crypt compartment harboring long-lived stem cells [11, 12] and the paneth cells that constitute the stem cell niche [13], a rapidly dividing transit amplifying zone and the Villus, a terminally differentiated region consisting of >90% enterocytes [14]. Lgr5 has been identified as a SI stem cell marker and transforming mutations in Lgr5+ SI cells have been shown to be highly tumorigenic [11, 15]. Subsequent studies have shown that Lgr5 marks additional adult stem cell populations, for instance in the hair follicle [16, 17]., A previously described Lgr5-GFP knock-in model allows the isolation of Lgr5-positive stem cells and their immediate descendants based on their GFP intensity [11]. Using this system, we established methylomes at single-base-resolution from three cell populations obtained directly, without any in-vitro culture steps, from the mouse SI: stem cells (GFP_High), their close descendants (GFP_Low), and terminally differentiated cells (Villus). In addition, in order to relate the methylation dynamics during differentiation to changes in DNA methylation that have been accumulated during earlier development, we compared the SI stem cell methylome with another Lgr5+ adult stem cell type from the hair bulge. Our results reveal, as expected, many loci that are differentially methylated between intestinal and hair bulge stem cells. These differences nicely reflect the differential expression patterns found in the two cell types. In contrast, we observed surprisingly stable DNA methylation patterns during SI stem cell differentiation, with no significant de-novo methylation of hypo-methylated sites. The only loci displaying significant DNA methylation dynamics are enhancers driving gene expression upon stem cell differentiation and we only observe tens of such loci. We also identify TCF4 as a transcription factor (TF) being both physically close to a subset of DMRs and affecting DMR formation, reflecting that TF binding is a significant factor in shaping DNA methylation patterns during SI stem cell differentiation in vivo., We describe single-base-resolution methylation analysis of an epithelial adult stem cell and its descendants. In contrast to studies describing the hematopoietic and ESC systems we do not observe widespread TSS methylation dynamics upon differentiation. TSS methylation in the stem cell already reflects the methylation status found in its differentiated descendants, suggesting that the epi-genome in the stem cell may be to some extent primed for differentiation into SI epithelial cells. Also, genes that become silent upon differentiation do not attract methylation on their TSSs, suggesting that the SI epithelium does not require a locking-in of gene expression status through DNA methylation. The few effects on DNA methylation that we do see are restricted to a set of enhancers that drive gene expression upon differentiation. At these loci, loss of DNA methylation appears to be promoted through TF binding. Below we will discuss our findings in more detail., Our data show that during the differentiation of the SI stem cell only a minimal amount of DMRs arise. Furthermore our results suggest a role for TCF4 in the formation of a subset of DMRs."

Multiple sirtuins are encoded by each eukaryotic genome, raising the possibility of cooperativity or functional overlap. The scope and variety of chromatin binding sites of the sirtuins in any specific organism remain unclear., Here we utilize the ChIP-seq technique to identify and functionally characterize the genome-wide targets of the sirtuins, Sir2, Hst1 to Hst4, and the DNA binding partner of Hst1, Sum 1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Unexpectedly, Sir2, Hst1 and Sum1, but not the other sirtuins, exhibit co-enrichment at several classes of chromatin targets. These include telomeric repeat clusters, tRNA genes, and surprisingly, the open reading frames (ORFs) of multiple highly expressed RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes that function in processes such as fermentation, glycolysis, and translation. Repression of these target genes during the diauxic shift is specifically dependent on Sir2/Hst1/Sum1 binding to the ORF and sufficiently high intracellular NAD+ concentrations. Sir2 recruitment to the ORFs is independent of the canonical SIR complex and surprisingly requires Sum1. The shared Sir2/Hst1/Sum1 targets also significantly overlap with condensin and cohesin binding sites, where Sir2, Hst1, and Sum1 were found to be important for condensin and cohesin deposition, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between metabolism and chromatin architecture during the diauxic shift., This study demonstrates the existence of overlap in sirtuin function, and advances our understanding of conserved sirtuin-regulated functions, including the regulation of glycolytic gene expression and condensin loading.","","The sirtuins are a highly conserved family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate a wide range of cellular processes impacted during aging and in age-associated diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer (reviewed in [1]). They utilize NAD+ as a co-substrate during the deacetylation reaction, such that one molecule of NAD+ is converted into nicotinamide and 2'O-acetyl ADP-ribose for every lysine that is deacetylated [2, 3]. As a result, sufficiently high NAD+ concentrations are required to properly regulate cellular processes in which the sirtuins participate [4, 5]. This link to NAD+ gives sirtuins an inherent ability to 'sense' the intracellular energy status, and regulate target proteins via lysine deacetylation., The genomes of eukaryotic organisms usually encode multiple sirtuin proteins. For example, there are seven sirtuins in mammals known as SIRT1 through SIRT7 [6], while the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes five, known as Sir2, and Hst1 through Hst4 (homologs of Sir two) [7]. Sir2 is the founding family member [7], and was initially characterized as a factor required for transcriptional silencing at the HML and HMR silent mating-type loci, telomeres, and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) tandem array, each of which have characteristics of heterochromatin in more complex eukaryotes (reviewed in [8]). Eventually, Sir2 was found to be a histone deacetylase [9, 10], a seminal discovery that instantly provided a mechanistic role for Sir2 in the formation of heterochromatin. Equally exciting were the implications for aging because Sir2 was also characterized as a limiting factor for replicative life span [11], which is defined as the number of times a yeast mother cell divides before senescing. Deletion of SIR2 shortens replicative life span, while increased SIR2 gene dosage extends both mean and maximum replicative life span [11]. Similarly, SIRT6 knock out mice prematurely age [12], and male SIRT6 transgenics are long-lived [13], suggesting that longevity and/or health span support by sirtuins could be one of their conserved features., Many histone-modifying enzymes are catalytic subunits of large multi-protein complexes, and the nuclear sirtuins appear to follow this trend. At the HM loci and telomeres, yeast Sir2 is associated with the Sir3 and Sir4 proteins in a complex known as SIR [14–16]. Deleting either of the SIR complex subunits results in a loss of transcriptional silencing [17, 18]. At the rDNA locus, Sir2 associates with Net1 and Cdc14 in the nucleolar silencing complex known as RENT, which silences RNA polymerase II transcription from the intergenic spacers [19, 20]. The Sir2 paralog, Hst1, forms a complex with Sum1 and Rfm1 (the Sum1 complex), which represses specific genes through localized histone deacetylation at promoters [21–23]. SIRT1 is considered the mammalian Sir2 ortholog, and like Sir2, is a histone deacetylase that can function in heterochromatin formation [24]. SIRT1 also regulates the expression of numerous genes and deacetylates numerous non-histone protein targets, but it has only recently been considered part of a larger multi-protein co-repressor complex [25]. Thus, sirtuins are generally recruited to multiple targets (chromatin or non-histone) through interactions with partner proteins that provide an added level of binding specificity. Given such diversity, complete inventories of conserved sirtuin targets, both chromatin and non-chromatin, are needed in order to understand how these factors are truly integrated with various cellular processes via NAD+., In this study we have focused on the identification and characterization of novel chromatin targets of sirtuins in yeast, with the goal of uncovering additional cellular pathways that are impacted by alterations in cellular NAD+, and determining the extent of functional overlap between the various sirtuins. Conserved targets of this nature are also more likely to be mediators of longevity. We have utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), followed by next generation DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), to obtain high-resolution chromatin association maps for each yeast sirtuin. Work presented in this study functionally characterizes the overlapping roles for Sir2, Hst1, and Sum1 in telomere maintenance, as well as NAD+-dependent repression of specific genes that are downregulated during the diauxic shift, a time in which yeast shift their metabolism from aerobic fermentation to respiration. These include genes involved in glycolysis, fermentation, and translation. Sir2, Hst1, and Sum1 were also required for the efficient recruitment of condensin and cohesin onto multiple shared target sites, including tRNAs and other genes downregulated during the diauxic shift., From an earlier expression profiling study, we identified thiamine biosynthesis genes as being upregulated when yeast cells were treated with the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, or when intracellular NAD+ levels were reduced by deleting the NAD+ salvage pathway gene NPT1 [26]. Hundreds of other genes were also upregulated, including known Hst1/Sum1 targets such as middle sporulation and NAD+ biosynthesis genes. These results raised the question of whether each sirtuin specifically regulates a distinct set of gene targets? We therefore set out to obtain a genome-wide picture of binding sites for each sirtuin using ChIP-seq. The sirtuins were carboxy-terminally tagged either with 13 copies of the Myc epitope (Sir2, Hst1, and Hst2) or one copy of the TAP-tag (Hst3 and Hst4). Sum1 was also tagged with 13xMyc to test if it consistently tracked with its binding partner Hst1. Cells growing exponentially in rich YPD medium were then subjected to ChIP with anti-Myc or anti-TAP antibodies, and the recovered DNA sequenced. Certain genomic regions were previously shown to be over- or under-represented when genomic DNA was sequenced by this method [27]. Therefore, to control for representation in the ChIP libraries, crosslinked DNA that went into the immunoprecipitation (IP) reactions (the input) was also sequenced., The budding yeast S. cerevisiae was used as a model system in identifying functional chromatin binding targets for all five sirtuins in this organism. A significant amount of overlap was surprisingly observed between Sir2 and Hst1, which was not shared with Hst2, Hst3, or Hst4. Importantly, these overlapping binding sites were not the previously described functional targets of Sir2 (silenced domains) or Hst1 (promoters of specific genes), but were instead novel targets. Binding of Sir2 and Hst1 at each new target class was functional, including telomere length maintenance at telomeric repeat clusters, diauxic shift-specific repression of glycolytic and translation factor genes through the binding to ORFs, and promoting condensin and cohesin deposition at overlapping positions. Sirtuins have numerous non-histone targets, but the results from this study highlight the idea that the chromatin targets of this enzyme class are equally broad and more highly conserved between yeast and human than previously thought."

Currently completeness is only described qualitatively and mis-assemblies are overlooked. Here we present REAPR, a tool that precisely identifies errors in genome assemblies without the need for a reference sequence. We have validated REAPR on complete genomes or de novo assemblies from bacteria, malaria and Caenorhabditis elegans, and demonstrate that 86% and 82% of the human and mouse reference genomes are error-free, respectively. When applied to an ongoing genome project, REAPR provides corrected assembly statistics allowing the quantitative comparison of multiple assemblies. REAPR is available at http://​www.​sanger.​ac.​uk/​resources/​software/​reapr/​., The volume of genome sequence data continues to increase exponentially yet methods that reliably assess the quality of assembled sequence are lacking. In an attempt to categorise the quality of genome assemblies, Chain et al. [1] proposed a series of qualitative descriptions. Although these serve as a useful guide, they do not provide statistical or numerical comparisons of data quality apart from the extreme case of a 'finished' sequence. The recent advent of so-called next generation sequencing (NGS) has seen a dramatic increase in the rate of production of new genome sequences, with a growing proportion of genome projects classified as 'permanent draft' [2]. Moreover, most published assemblies do not get classified but are in fact also of 'draft' quality [3], which is the least accurate of all the categories. Relatively few reference genomes undergo continuous and rigorous quality improvement to repair errors. Two notable exceptions are the human genome [4] and the Plasmodium falciparum genome [5], where versioned error correction allows the comparison of sequence improvements over time. The reliability of reference sequence data is crucial for the interpretation of downstream functional genomic analysis and thus a metric indicating the genome wide accuracy of the reference sequence is essential., Over 35 different tools ('assemblers') are available to perform de novo genome assembly [6]. The assembly of the short reads produced by NGS technology is however known to be problematic [7, 8], despite the high coverage and range of insert sizes available. The precise behaviour of assemblers on a given genome is hard to predict without prior knowledge of its base composition, size, repetitive sequences and levels of polymorphism. Often the solution is to run assemblies with multiple tools or parameters and pick the best one based on summary statistics. Frequently, contig or scaffold N50 sizes are reported (the contig/scaffold size above which half the genome is represented) but although these are supposed to indicate contiguity (and certainly not accuracy), the frequent inclusion of incorrectly joined sequences provides a false boost to N50s despite reducing the accuracy of the genome consensus sequence. A better approach is to make a more informed decision on the best assembly by considering the real contiguity together with the errors in each assembly. Recent assembler evaluations GAGE [9] and Assemblathon 1 [10] highlighted the variability in performance of assemblers when given different input data or when changing their parameters. However, studies such as these require a known reference genome in order to assess the assemblies - a luxury that is unavailable when producing a de novo assembly., The development of genome assembly analysis tools that do not require the use of a reference sequence for comparison is currently an active area of research, with a few tools already available. All tools share the similarity that they use the position of read pairs within an assembly to perform their analysis. Amosvalidate [11] was developed before the introduction of NGS, requires a file format produced by few assemblers and does not scale well to the large volumes of data typified by modern genome projects. Subsequent tools were recently introduced to work with NGS, all of which analyse assemblies using remapped reads and are effective at determining the best assembly from a set of assemblies of the same data. CGAL [12] and ALE [13] both produce a summary likelihood score of an assembly, with ALE also reporting four likelihood scores for each base. FRCbam [14] uses many metrics to identify 'features', which correspond to erroneous regions of an assembly and are used to plot a feature response curve [15]. The best assembly can be determined by overlaying these curves., However, all of these tools lack the crucial ability to transform metrics into accurate error calls, or to report a single score for each base that defines whether the assembly is correct or wrong at any given position. Therefore we developed a reference-free algorithm (REAPR - Recognition of Errors in Assemblies using Paired Reads), applicable to large genomes and NGS data, with two principle aims: to score every base for accuracy and to automatically pinpoint mis-assemblies. The output is aimed to be as useful and informative as possible to the end-user and includes the bases identified as 'error-free' (see later for a definition), the location of assembly errors, and a new assembly that has been broken at points of assembly error. This information allows the N50 to be recalculated into the corrected N50 metric, similarly to previous studies that required a reference sequence [9, 10]. Thus, the combination of the number of error-free bases and the corrected N50 can now provide an effective summary of any genome assembly., Here we have described the first algorithm that translates per-base metrics into error calls of reference sequences and de novo assemblies using NGS data. Establishing the quality of those sequences will become increasingly important as the assembly process shifts to more automated methods [3]. For example, REAPR correctly identified the ALLPATHS assembly to be the best of the GAGE S. aureus assemblies, without using a reference sequence. This assembly had the fewest error calls, the greatest number of error-free bases and the fewest warnings reported by REAPR (Additional file 1, Tables S1-3). Therefore we propose that REAPR should be applied to all genome projects prior to computing standard contiguity statistics (such as the N50). In this way the quality of assemblies and performance of assemblers can be compared robustly via a method that produces metrics that are constant between methodologies or datasets. By also providing a per base value for the accuracy of a sequence, that can be easily overlaid and viewed by the end-user, different genomes or assembly versions can be accurately compared and downstream analysis enhanced by enabling the end-user to be aware of regions of questionable accuracy."
"131","Mutations within lncRNAs are effectively selected against in fruitfly but not in human","Wilfried Haerty, Chris P Ponting","MRC Functional Genomics Unit, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford","Wilfried Haerty","wilfried.haerty@dpag.ox.ac.uk","27 May 2013","Previous studies in Drosophila and mammals have revealed levels of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) sequence conservation that are intermediate between neutrally evolving and protein-coding sequence. These analyses compared conservation between species that diverged up to 75 million years ago. However, analysis of sequence polymorphisms within a species' population can provide an understanding of essentially contemporaneous selective constraints that are acting on lncRNAs and can quantify the deleterious effect of mutations occurring within these loci., We took advantage of polymorphisms derived from the genome sequences of 163 Drosophila melanogaster strains and 174 human individuals to calculate the distribution of fitness effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms occurring within intergenic lncRNAs and compared this to distributions for SNPs present within putatively neutral or protein-coding sequences. Our observations show that in D.melanogaster there is a significant excess of rare frequency variants within intergenic lncRNAs relative to neutrally evolving sequences, whereas selection on human intergenic lncRNAs appears to be effectively neutral. Approximately 30% of mutations within these fruitfly lncRNAs are estimated as being weakly deleterious., These contrasting results can be attributed to the large difference in effective population sizes between the two species. Our results suggest that while the sequences of lncRNAs will be well conserved across insect species, such loci in mammals will accumulate greater proportions of deleterious changes through genetic drift.","","Although protein coding sequence occupies a little over 1% of the human genome, approximately 10-fold more non-coding sequence is predicted to have been under purifying selection [1]. For smaller genomes, larger proportions (for example, 50% of all Drosophila sequence) have been predicted to have been under selective constraints [13]. These estimates are founded on the assumption that sequence conservation is caused not by low rates of mutation, but instead by the high rates at which deleterious alleles are purged from the population by natural selection, an assumption that is well supported [47]., A considerable fraction of conserved non-coding sequences in human and fruitfly genomes are transcribed [8, 9]. Non-coding transcripts can be classified into small RNAs (<200 nt, such as microRNA) and long RNAs (>200 nt, lncRNA). Many lncRNAs are spliced and/or polyadenylated [10], and they show tendencies to contain a smaller number of exons than protein coding genes and to be expressed in a tissue and/or developmental stage-specific manner [11]-[13]., A handful of lncRNAs have been functionally characterised as being involved in dosage compensation in either human (Xist [14]) or Drosophila (roX1, roX2 [15]), or having roles in imprinting or chromatin modification (AIRN [16]; HOTAIR [17]), in alternative splicing regulation or in cell differentiation (MALAT1, Tug1 [18]-[20]). More broadly many lncRNAs appear to be involved in gene expression regulation in either cis or trans, through the local modification of chromatin and/or direct interaction with protein complexes, DNA or RNA sequences [11, 12, 21]-[23]. Recently lncRNAs have also been associated with the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency [24, 25]. Furthermore, there is limited evidence to link some lncRNAs, such as ANRIL or HOTAIR, to human pathologies [26, 27]. However, the functional contribution to biology from the vast majority of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains unknown., If a lncRNA has retained functionality over a long evolutionary time-period then mutations that abolish or diminish the function would be deleterious and would preferentially be purged from the species lineage. This would be reflected in a greater level of sequence conservation between species. Indeed, lncRNAs have been found to be significantly better conserved between species than are putatively neutrally evolving sequences, such as ancestral repeats in mammals [28]-[30] or small introns in Drosophila [13]. Furthermore, mammalian lncRNAs are enriched in conserved sequences identified either by elevated conservation (for example, phastCons [2]) scores or by applying a neutral model based on sequence insertions and deletions [28, 30]. Additionally, increased conservation of the dinucleotide splice sites and a suppressed transversion rate have also been reported for mammals [28]. However, in each organism analysed thus far, lncRNA sequences have been shown to diverge far more rapidly than have protein-coding sequences [13, 28]-[31]. These observations indicate an intermediate state in selective constraints between protein-coding sequences and neutrally evolving sequences. The rapid divergence of lncRNA sequences between species complicates the identification of orthologous sequences for many of the lncRNA loci. Therefore, instead of nucleotide conservation, the conservation of orientation and position relative to an orthologous protein coding-gene can be used to define positionally equivalent lncRNAs between species [13, 32]., To date, most evolutionary analyses on lncRNAs have been conducted at the interspecies level using species that diverged approximately 75 million (human - mouse [28]) or 5 million years (Drosophila melanogaster - D. simulans [13]) ago. Although there is mounting evidence for purifying selection acting on lncRNAs, we note that previous analyses have used only a single reference genome per species. Previous studies reported an increased conservation level relative to a neutral reference [13, 28]-[30], but they have not directly determined the strength of selection acting on these non-coding sequences nor do they provide an understanding of the fitness effects of mutations, in terms of the product of the effective population size (Ne) and selection coefficient (s), occurring within these transcripts., It is important to compare interspecific indicators of constraint to intraspecific estimates of fitness effects since recent findings have demonstrated rapid evolution of lncRNAs that are specific to individual lineages [33]. A comparison between species can inform on past events but rarely does it have the power to identify contemporaneous or lineage-specific selective constraints. Even when employing comparisons among multiple species it is challenging to ascertain, within a specific lineage, the nature and the strength of the selective pressures acting on rapidly evolving loci., For instance, the HOTAIR locus has evolved rapidly since the last common ancestor of mouse and human and differences in the consequences of knockout in these species' cell lines have been interpreted as indicating the evolution of lineage specific biological functions [34]. Additionally, it was recently demonstrated that expression of a large number of lncRNA loci has altered rapidly among murid lineages [33]. Consequently, a low level of sequence conservation between two species could reflect, at one extreme, a historically low level of sequence constraint in both lineages, or, at the other extreme, it could reflect sequence that is constrained in only a portion of a single species lineage. Deciding among this range of possibilities relies on determining constraint within extant populations, for example by identifying whether derived low frequency alleles are enriched, relative to neutral sequence, within human or Drosophila lncRNA sequence [35]. A recent study indicated that this was, indeed, the case for human lncRNAs identified by the ENCODE consortium [36]., In such studies we need to consider that most human variants are recent [7, 37], and there is a negative correlation between the age of the variant and its deleterious effect [7]. Consequently the bulk of deleterious mutations within a species are less likely to be detected when comparing distantly-related species as they will not often reach fixation.Therefore inter-species comparison will focus on substitutions events that are at most weakly deleterious as deleterious mutations are rarely fixed. Once again this underscores the importance of analysing, at the population level, nucleotide variation occurring within lncRNA loci if we are to better understand the relationships linking their evolution and function. A potentially important confounding issue that needs to be considered in such analyses is that of background selection as well as selective sweeps, where selection at one site reduces genetic diversity, but not divergence, at linked sites [38]. To account for this effect, variation at tested sites needs to be compared against variation in physically linked putatively neutral sites., For this study, we have taken advantage of recent high-throughput sequencing projects win D. melanogaster [39] and humans [37][40], and the annotation of intergenic lncRNAs in both species [13, 41]. The availability of these large population datasets permits polymorphism and divergence distributions to be investigated in both species across both coding and non-coding gene models. If the function of a lncRNA locus is mediated through the act of transcription rather than through the RNA transcript itself [42, 43] then we expect no difference in nucleotide conservation between exons and introns. In contrast, if the spliced transcript primarily has a RNA sequence-dependent function then its exonic sequence is expected to be well-conserved relative to its introns, as has been observed for protein-coding genes [44]., Our results reveal hitherto unappreciated distinctions in constraint between lncRNA exons and introns which are abundantly evident for Drosophila but are far less so for humans. In Drosophila striking differences in conservation between exons and introns suggest that the spliced transcript is often important in mediating the biological functions of lncRNA loci. Our analysis of site frequency spectra indicates that purifying selection has been effective on D. melanogaster lncRNA sequence but, importantly, not on human lncRNAs. Selection on mutations within human lncRNAs appear to be effectively neutral as a consequence of our species' unusually low effective population size., Previous between species comparisons predict lncRNAs to have evolved under a regime of purifying selection that is considerably weaker than for protein-coding sequences [13, 28]-[31]. Because of their design, virtually all of these experiments consider evolutionarily ancient selective events. However by taking advantage of available sequenced genomes of individuals from within the same species, we can now: (1) infer the evolution of these sequences at a considerably shorter time scale; (2) quantify more precisely the strength of recent or contemporaneous selection acting on lncRNAs; and (3) assess the distribution of fitness effect of new deleterious mutations occurring within these sequences. From the reported importance of a limited subset of lncRNAs in gene regulation [23, 25, 26], it might have been expected that human lncRNAs would exhibit a weak signature of purifying selection at the population level., Genetic drift appears to be the main driving force in the evolution of intergenic lncRNAs, at least in humans, as a consequence of our small effective population size. Therefore, weakly to mildly deleterious mutations are likely to have accumulated rapidly within intergenic lncRNAs. The consequences of such an accumulation on lncRNA function and on human biology have yet to be experimentally assessed. Our observations serve to highlight the pressing need for extending the study of these loci to in-vivo systems combined with extensive phenotyping. Our results support a less prominent biological role for many of these non-coding loci than has been proposed previously [83, 84]., In all analyses that we describe below, calculated P values were corrected for multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction [85]., Our analysis in D. melanogaster was conducted on the set of 1,115 long non-coding intergenic RNAs defined by Young et al. [13] using polyA+-selected transcriptome data from the ModEncode Project [9] having excluded four loci owing to their overlap with recently predicted small open reading frames [86]. For comparison we also analysed a set of 4,662 human lncRNAs identified by Cabili et al. [41] from polyA+-selected libraries using conservative criteria, namely one isoform reconstructed in at least two tissues or by two assemblers [41]., Because mono-exonic lncRNAs models are not stranded, we limited our analysis to multi-exonic loci. Furthermore, in order to avoid the confounding effects arising from selection acting on protein-coding genes we focused our analysis on intergenic lncRNA loci, instead of intronic, antisense or lncRNAs that overlap untranslated regions of protein-coding genes., We used the mouse lncRNAs annotated by Ensembl and by Belgard et al. [87] to identify positional equivalent lncRNAs between mouse and human. Using protein-coding genes with 1-to-1 orthologous relationships between human and mouse and flanking a lncRNA locus in both species, we defined as positional equivalents those lncRNAs that were found in the same transcriptional orientation and the same location relative to a protein-coding gene in both species. Furthermore, in order to take into account potential selection acting on the nearby protein-coding gene, we also identified a control set composed of lncRNAs flanking protein-coding genes with 1-to-1 orthologs but with different transcriptional orientations and/or positions relative to the protein coding gene. We identified 374 positional equivalents loci between human and mouse, and 802 control lncRNAs., We collected 2,993 genes described as being involved in syndromes and genetic diseases from OMIM database [88, 89]. Using the FlyBase database [90], we collated 2,125 genes with lethal mutant phenotypes., 
                D. melanogaster and human gene annotations and genomes were downloaded from FlyBase [90] (release 5.39) and Ensembl [91] (release 64), respectively., Polymorphism data for 162 D. melanogaster strains from Raleigh, North Carolina were downloaded from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel [39, 92, 93]. Sites covered by at least 10 reads and without base ambiguity in at least 150 strains were retained for further analysis. A total of 3,172,754 sites across the five major chromosomal elements were used for analysis. For the human dataset, we discarded SNPs within 10 bp of indel calls and chose a quality score threshold to give a 0.1% FDR. The allele frequencies for polymorphic sites were retrieved from the 1000 Genomes Project data. We collected 18,745,840 SNPs in 174 individuals of African origin (a highly polymorphic population) called by the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium [40, 94]., For both datasets, we polarised the alleles into ancestral or derived states using the pairwise alignments of D. melanogaster with D. simulans and D. yakuba, and of H. sapiens with the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and macaque (Macaca mulatta) which are available from the UCSC genome database website [95]. We used maximum parsimony to infer the ancestral state of each site, and ambiguous sites were removed from the final dataset. Using genome annotations, we collated sites found within exons and introns of protein-coding genes, lncRNA loci or intergenic sequences or ancestral repeats (transposable elements shared between human, mouse and rat) (Table [1])."

Whereas DNA methylation patterns are generally inherited during replication, both embryonic and somatic differentiation processes require the removal of cytosine methylation at specific gene loci to activate lineage-restricted elements. However, the exact mechanisms facilitating the erasure of DNA methylation remain unclear in many cases., We previously established human post-proliferative monocytes as a model to study active DNA demethylation. We now show, for several previously identified genomic sites, that the loss of DNA methylation during the differentiation of primary, post-proliferative human monocytes into dendritic cells is preceded by the local appearance of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Monocytes were found to express the methylcytosine dioxygenase Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) 2, which is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of this enzyme in primary monocytes prevented active DNA demethylation, suggesting that TET2 is essential for the proper execution of this process in human monocytes., The work described here provides definite evidence that TET2-mediated conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine initiates targeted, active DNA demethylation in a mature postmitotic myeloid cell type.","Epigenetics, active DNA demethylation, differentiation","DNA methylation is a frequent epigenetic modification that restricts the activity of regulatory elements, including cell type-specific gene promoters and enhancers. In mammals, methylated cytosines (5mC) mainly occur in the context of CpG dinucleotides and the targeted setting and erasure of the methylation mark is crucial for the silencing of repetitive and potentially harmful elements and for the proper execution of essential regulatory programs including embryonic development, X-chromosome inactivation, parental imprinting as well as cellular differentiation [1, 2]. While the process of cytosine methylation, which is catalyzed by a group of DNA methyl-transferases (DNMTs) is well characterized, the exact mechanisms facilitating the erasure of DNA methylation in mammals remain less clear and the proposed existence of active enzymatic demethylation processes has been a matter of controversy over the last decades [3]., Recent pioneering work has identified the family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation proteins (TET1-3) that catalyze the conversion of 5mC to 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (5hmC) in mammalian cells [4], and has prompted speculations that these enzymes are involved in DNA demethylation processes [5, 6]. On the one hand, 5hmC could interfere with maintenance methylation and induce a passive demethylation process. On the other hand, TET enzymes may also initiate active demethylation processes through repair-associated mechanisms [7]., Global DNA demethylation is observed during early embryonal development in particular in zygotes and primordial germ cells and 5hmC has been detected in both pathways [8, 9]. The initial massive erasure of 5mC in primordial germ cells, however, appears to be a TET-independent, passive process that is likely controlled by the downregulation of UHRF1, which facilitates the recruitment of the maintenance DNA-methyltransferase DNMT1 to nascent hemimethylated DNA at the replication fork [10]. In the zygote, however, TET3 mediated conversion of 5mC to 5hmC is essential for the reprogramming of the zygotic paternal DNA after fertilization [11–13]. 5hmC is then gradually replaced by unmethylated cytosines during preimplantation development, suggesting that the erasure of 5hmC in zygotes is also a DNA replication-dependent passive process [12]., Another member of this family (TET2) directly affects myelopoiesis and diverse myeloid malignancies (including myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and acute myeloid leukemia) are frequently associated with mutations in this gene [14–16]. Targeted disruption or knockdown of TET2 results in reduced levels of 5hmC and affects self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells [17–20]. However, the exact mechanisms that contribute to disease pathology are currently unknown., Here we provide direct evidence that the TET2-dependent conversion of 5mC to 5hmC is required for active DNA demethylation in primary human monocytes. Similar processes are likely to occur in other myeloid (progenitor) cells and the reduced ability to erase DNA methylation at critical regulatory sites in cases with TET2 loss-of-function mutations may therefore contribute to disease pathology., Many previous studies focused on proliferating cell types that were mitotically arrested to distinguish between active and passive DNA demethylation mechanisms. Using methyl-CpG-immunoprecipitation (MCIp) and a global microarray-based approach to detect differences in DNA methylation [21, 22], we recently identified a number of actively demethylated regions in a natural setting of post-mitotic cells: the differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes into monocyte-derived macrophages or dendritic cells (Figure 1). DNA demethylation events were highly reproducible and paralleled or followed the appearance of 'activating' histone modifications, suggesting that a proposed DNA demethylation machinery is recruited as part of other chromatin-modifying processes associated with gene activation or transcriptional priming [23]. However, the exact mechanisms leading to DNA demethylation in human monocytes remain unclear.

                    , Recent studies have implicated the family of Ten-Eleven-Translocation proteins (TET1-3) in active demethylation processes via the generation of 5hmC. To test whether TET proteins might be involved, we studied the appearance of 5hmC at previously defined sites of active DNA demethylation [23] in time-courses of differentiating human monocytes and compared the appearance of 5hmC (measured using hMeDIP) with traditional measurements of bisulfite treated DNA (which globally converts cytosines to uracil except 5mC and 5hmC) using mass spectrometry as well as 5mC levels measured by MeDIP. Figure 2 summarizes the results for six different genomic regions. These loci (schematically illustrated in Figure 2A) included four regions showing DNA demethylation with either fast (CCL13, USP20) or slow kinetics as well as two control regions characterized by constitutive DNA methylation (HOXB1) or demethylation (MMP7) during the time courses. As shown in Figure 2C, the local erasure of DNA methylation (5mC and 5hmC as detected by mass spectrometry) was always found to correlate with the synchronous appearance of 5hmC (as measured by hMeDIP). At the CCL13 promoter both 5mC and 5hmC disappeared at later stages of DC differentiation, suggesting that the erasure of methylation marks might proceed to completeness (as observed at CpG dinucleotide 1) in this case. Since measurements of bisulfite treated DNA do not distinguish between 5mC and 5hmC, we also followed local DNA methylation levels using MeDIP (Figure S1 in Additional File 5). While the 5mC antibody appeared less sensitive compared to the 5hmC antibody, we also observed demethylation of the four loci using this method. The local conversion of 5mC to 5hmC was further confirmed by an independent approach utilizing 5hmC-specific glycosyltransferase for 5hmC detection by glycosylation-sensitive restriction (Figure S2 in Additional File 5). These results clearly established that 5hmC appears at actively demethylated sites during monocyte differentiation.

                    , To study a causal relationship between TET2 enzymes and DNA demethylation, we analyzed mRNA expression of TET genes during monocyte differentiation and found that monocytes and monocyte-derived cells primarily expressed TET2 (Figure 3). Expression of TET1 was undetectable and expression of TET3 was much weaker and less reproducible (Figure 3). In contrast to TET2 (see below) we were also unable to detect TET1 or TET3 by western blotting using commercial antibodies. These data established TET2 as the candidate enzyme for the local oxidation of 5mC in monocytes.

                        TET2 is expressed in human monocytes. The expression profile of TET2 during monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells is shown. Quantitative RT-PCR results are shown relative to HPRT1 expression and represent mean values ± SD (n=6). TET3 levels were considerably lower and no mRNA expression was detected for TET1 in monocytes or monocyte-derived cells.
                    , To test whether ablation of TET2 would affect the process of active DNA demethylation, we established a transient siRNA transfection protocol for freshly isolated human blood monocytes using control- or TET2-siRNA before culturing them under iDC culture conditions. Monocytes are generally difficult to transfect - as sensitive sentinels of the innate immune system, they respond to foreign nucleic acids including plasmid DNA and siRNAs, which affects differentiation and survival. We thus only studied 'early' time points (27 h and 42 h) after transfection where survival was largely unaffected by siRNA transfection (Figure S3A in Additional File 5). As shown by the reduced expression of the DC markers CD1a (FACS staining in Figure S3A and qRT-PCR in Figure S3B in Additional File 5) and CCL13 (qRT-PCR in Figure S3B in Additional File 5) the transfection did have an effect on the differentiation process. Concomitant, transient transfections also delayed DNA demethylation (see below), but since the process was clearly detected, the siRNA approach still allows addressing the demethylation mechanism. In addition to analyzing the effects of TET2 knockdown, we also established the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the two DNA glycosylases MBD4 and TDG that have previously been implicated in the removal of deaminated 5mC [7, 24, 25] or 5hmC via 5-Carboxylcytosine (5caC) [26, 27] in other cellular systems. As shown in Figure 4A-C the average knockdown at 27 h or 42 h ranged between 25% and 60% and 5% and 40% of control siRNA transfected cells on RNA and on protein level, respectively.

Protein levels of TET2, MBD4, or TDG were analysed using western blotting (results are representative of n=3 independent experiments).

(E) Bar charts for MassARRAY results of the indicated CpG residues of actively demethylated (CCL13, USP20) or control loci (MMP7, HOXB1). Values are mean ± SD (n≥4; * P <0.05, *** P <0.001 Student's T-test, paired, two-sided).
                    , To study the effect of siRNA knockdowns, DNA methylation levels were analyzed at 27 h or 42 h using mass spectrometry of bisulfite treated DNA. Results are shown as heatmaps for the entire regions (Figure 4D) and bar charts for selected individual CpGs (Figure 4E). Interestingly, the methylation pattern derived from bisulfite treated DNA after knockdown of MBD4 or TDG was undistinguishable from control siRNA treatment (Figure 4D and 4E). This indicates that neither of these two enzymes actively converts 5hmC, which is in line with previous observations [27]. Tet proteins were recently shown to metabolize 5hmC to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5caC [28], which are both converted into uracil during bisulfite treatment [26, 29]. Because we cannot distinguish 5fC/5caC from unmethylated cytosine residues after bisulfite treatment, we are currently not able to address whether MBD4 or TDG are active to 'complete' the demethylation process in primary monocytes that is initiated by TET2 mediated processing of 5mC into 5hmC and further into 5fC/5caC. Since human blood monocytes are (in contrast to monocyte-derived macrophages or dendritic cells) severely impaired in base and DNA double-strand break repair [30], the exchange of the two 5mC derivatives may be delayed. To test whether 5fC/5caC accumulate as the end product of the demethylation process at the CCL13 promoter, we analyzed the restriction efficiency of MspI (which is inhibited by the presence of 5caC or 5fC [28]) at the site covering one of the demethylated CpGs. While MspI can also be inhibited by methylation of the outer C (5mCCGG) and thus may not allow the quantification of 5caC or 5fC, the fact that DNA from iDC (as well as from all knockdown experiments) could be efficiently cut with this restriction enzyme (Figure S4 in Additional File 5) suggests that the demethylation process is completed (5mC→5C) in iDC. MBD4 or TDG knockdown did not lead to a decrease in restriction efficiency, indicating that 5caC or 5fC do not accumulate at these sites in transfected monocytes. It is thus still unclear whether TDG, MBD4, or another enzyme initiates the last steps of the active demethylation process. Notably, a recent mass spectrometry study systematically identified readers in embryonic stem cells, neuronal progenitor cells, and brain for all known 5C derivates [31]. This study identified a number of additional DNA glycosylases (Neil1, Neil3), as well as helicases (Hells, Harp, Recql, and its homolog Bloom) binding specifically to hmC suggesting that this derivate may already attract DNA-repair enzymes and perhaps initiate DNA demethylation in differentiating monocytes., The TET2-siRNA treatment, however, resulted in significantly different methylation patterns: the local loss of DNA methylation at the two loci showing rapid 5mC erasure (CCL13 and USP20) was significantly delayed in cells with reduced TET2 expression (Figure 4D and 4E), while control regions were unaffected and the late demethylation targets did not show any signs of methylation loss at these early time points. We also analyzed local 5hmC levels using hMeDIP (Figure S5A in Additional File 5), as well as glycosylation-sensitive restriction (Figure S5B in Additional File 5) and detected a significant reduction of 5hmC at demethylated regions only in TET2-siRNA-treated monocytes. These results clearly establish that differentiating monocytes require TET2 to initiate the active demethylation process., As shown previously, DNA demethylation in primary monocytes is characterized by the parallel appearance of activating histone marks, such as mono- and dimethylation of H3K4 or acetylation of histones H3 and H4 [23], which are typical features of enhancers. This is also in line with the recent observation of dynamic deposition of 5hmC at differentiation-associated enhancers in other cellular systems [32]. The histone modifications likely follow the recruitment of DNA-binding factors that direct histone methyl- and/or acetyl-transferases to these sites [23]. The local appearance of 5hmC suggests that the modified histones or the same factors responsible for the modification of histones may also recruit the 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 to initiate DNA demethylation of newly activated and/or remodeled sites., Our data unequivocally show that the TET2-mediated conversion of 5mC to 5hmC is an essential intermediate in targeted, locus-specific active demethylation processes that are observed during the differentiation of non-dividing human monocytes. This function of TET2 may also be essential for the differentiation of earlier myeloid progenitor stages, as a significant proportion of myeloid dysplasia are characterized by loss-of-function mutations of TET2."

It is widely discussed that poor intra-uterine conditions could induce long-lasting epigenetic modifications, leading to systemic changes in regulation of metabolic genes. To address this, we acquire genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from saliva DNA in a unique cohort of 17 monozygotic monochorionic female twins very discordant for birth weight. We examine if adverse prenatal growth conditions experienced by the smaller co-twins lead to long-lasting DNA methylation changes., Overall, co-twins show very similar genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. Since observed differences are almost exclusively caused by variable cellular composition, an original marker-based adjustment strategy was developed to eliminate such variation at affected CpGs. Among adjusted and unchanged CpGs 3,153 are differentially methylated between the heavy and light co-twins at nominal significance, of which 45 show sensible absolute mean β-value differences. Deep bisulfite sequencing of eight such loci reveals that differences remain in the range of technical variation, arguing against a reproducible biological effect. Analysis of methylation in repetitive elements using methylation-dependent primer extension assays also indicates no significant intra-pair differences., Severe intra-uterine growth differences observed within these monozygotic twins are not associated with long-lasting DNA methylation differences in cells composing saliva, detectable with up-to-date technologies. Additionally, our results indicate that uneven cell type composition can lead to spurious results and should be addressed in epigenomic studies.","","Both observational human and experimental animal studies have confirmed that low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases, like type 2 diabetes (T2D) [1–3]. Although genetic factors are likely to contribute [4, 5], studies assessing the association between low birth weight and T2D precursors in monozygotic (MZ) twins showed that the twin who was lighter at birth had a more adverse metabolic profile in adulthood compared to its genetically identical co-twin, who was heavier at birth [6–10]. This suggests that the association between low birth weight and increased T2D risk is at least partly independent of genetic factors., One of the possible molecular mechanisms explaining this non-genetic association suggests that poor prenatal conditions induce epigenetic modifications [11]. These epigenetic modifications are believed to cause a 'thrifty' metabolic state, which is beneficial for survival under circumstances of insufficient nutrient supply, but unfavorable when nutrient supply is abundant in postnatal life. An important epigenetic phenomenon is DNA methylation that almost exclusively occurs at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides and correlates with transcriptional repression, while loss of methylation can result in transcriptional activation [12]., The notion that poor intra-uterine conditions cause epigenetic modifications during prenatal development is supported by data from animal studies, where dietary restriction or surgical interventions are used to induce fetal growth restriction, resulting in epigenetic modifications on metabolic disease-related genes (reviewed by [13]). The number of studies assessing the relation between an adverse fetal environment and epigenetic alterations in humans is gradually growing as well. For instance, humans who were periconceptionally exposed to famine during the Dutch Hunger Winter (1944 to 1945) were reported to show significant methylation differences at several imprinted and non-imprinted genes in comparison to their unexposed siblings in peripheral blood cells [14, 15]. A genome-wide DNA methylation study performed on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood of five intra-uterine growth restricted (IUGR) neonates and five gestational age and gender-matched controls [16] identified among others significant methylation differences at the HNF4A gene, which is involved in monogenic diabetes., However, epigenetic association studies using population- or family-based designs suffer from confounding caused by DNA sequence variation. Specifically, since birth weight is partly controlled by genetic factors [17], a study with genetically unmatched cases and controls cannot dissect whether a small size at birth is due to a poor prenatal environment or genetic predisposition. On the other hand, epigenetic variation is often a result of genetic variation - for example, allele specific methylation where the methylation pattern of a DNA molecule is determined by a cis- or trans-acting genetic variant [18]. Since MZ twins originate from one zygote, they are almost absolutely genetically identical, which makes them ideal to search for epigenetic phenomena associated with phenotypic discordancy. In addition, MZ twins are matched for gender, (gestational) age, maternal factors (for example, parity, age) and a broad range of environmental factors., Depending on whether the embryo splits during an early or later developmental stage, MZ twins can be dichorionic (DC) or monochorionic (MC), respectively. MZ DC twins have two separate placentas, while MZ MC twins share a single placenta [19]. It has been shown that the degree of DNA methylation dissimilarity varies between MZ MC and MZ DC twins [20], indicating that, for epigenetic purposes, one should either study MZ MC or MZ DC twins. Due to placental blood vessel connections and unequal sharing of the placenta, imbalanced blood and nutrient supply is more common in MZ MC compared to MZ DC twins [21]. Poor prenatal conditions experienced by only one co-twin often result in large intra-pair birth weight differences within MZ MC pairs [22], turning them into a 'natural experiment' to study the fetal programming origins of late onset human diseases., We hypothesized that if poor prenatal conditions induce changes in DNA methylation patterns that remain throughout life, these changes should be visible in MZ MC twins discordant for birth weight, irrespective of their health status (degree of insulin resistance, obesity, and so on) in adulthood. To identify loci that are differentially methylated due to poor prenatal conditions, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in 17 adult female MZ MC twin pairs with a relative birth weight difference greater than 20%. The twins were recruited from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS), which started in 1964 and is unique due to its long-term extensive collection of perinatal (for example, birth weight, gestational age, parity) and placental data (for example, chorionicity) of nearly 8,800 twin pairs [19]. DNA was isolated from saliva, a bio-fluid that is easily accessible via a totally non-invasive method and therefore widely used in large cohort studies and perfect for diagnostic purposes. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were determined using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and validated using targeted deep coverage bisulfite sequencing. Additionally, repetitive element methylation levels were determined using methylation-dependent primer extension assays. Our thorough DNA methylation analyses in saliva of birth weight discordant MZ MC twins show that the adverse prenatal growth conditions experienced by the smaller co-twins do not lead to long-lasting DNA methylation changes in cells composing saliva (that is, buccal epithelium and leukocytes), detectable with up-to-date technologies. In addition, we observe that EWASs can be hampered by variation in cellular composition, which can lead to spurious results. We present an adjustment method to normalize the DNA methylation data with respect to variable cell-type content., Finally, the DNA methylation levels of the genome dispersed repetitive elements human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERVK) and long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) were evaluated using methylation-dependent primer extension assays. For every CpG analyzed, mean methylation indices (MIs; similar to Illumina's β-values) were very similar among the heavy and light co-twins and no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05) (Table 5). Some CpGs strongly correlated with PTPN7 methylation (HERVK CpG1 r = -0.89, LINE1 CpG1 r = -0.49), indicating that global methylation levels are lower in buccal epithelium. Accordingly, when we repeated the analysis following PTPN7 methylation adjustment, no significant associations could be detected (data not shown).Table 5

                  , We aimed to identify loci that remain differentially methylated in adult body fluid cells as a consequence of a poor prenatal environment. Our hypothesis was that DNA methylation changes induced by adverse intra-uterine conditions are detectable in adult MZ MC twins with large intra-pair weight differences at birth, irrespective of their health status in adulthood. We used Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to profile DNA methylation changes genome-wide, and applied 454 GSFLX-based single-molecule DBS to validate potential methylation variable positions (MVPs). To assess possible changes in repetitive element methylation, we applied bisulfite-based primer extension high-performance liquid chromatography (SIRPH) assays. Despite cellular composition differences, our thorough DNA methylation analyses show that the methylomes in saliva of birth weight discordant MZ MC twins are very similar., All analyses were performed on DNA isolated from saliva, a bio-fluid that contains adequate amounts of DNA and is easy accessible via a totally non-invasive method. Assuming that MVPs are maintained in a systemic way, saliva DNA should be suitable for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, like any other accessible body fluid such as blood. However, we observed that the composition of saliva can be highly variable, possibly causing confounding effects since DNA methylation signatures are cell type-specific. Such hardly controllable effects should be accounted for when studying the association of DNA methylation to the phenotype of interest. This can either be done by separating cells prior to the methylation analysis, which is usually a challenging experimental task, or by using methods that allow a post-sampling adjustment for cellular composition. Indeed, here we show that cell type-specific epigenetic signatures of cells can be used for such post-sampling adjustment., When (young) MZ twins are used for epigenetic studies, tissues other than blood are preferred (often buccal epithelium). This is because MZ twins often have a shared blood supply during intra-uterine development, and therefore epigenetically discordant MZ twins can display the same epigenetic defect in blood while, for instance, in fibroblasts the epigenetic defect is restricted to the affected twin only [27, 28]. Interestingly, Kaminsky et al. [20] observed that methylation profiles of buccal swab DNA are significantly more variable within MZ MC twins compared to MZ DC twins. They suggested that this epigenetic dissimilarity may reflect differences in epigenetic divergence among embryonic cells at the time of splitting. Since buccal swabs also contain saliva [24], our results indicate that the previously reported epigenetic differences within MZ MC twins observed by Kaminsky et al. [20] might be caused by sample composition-attributed variation of, for example, leukocytes and epithelial cells [24], rather than a real developmental difference., Our results show that MZ twins have very similar genome-wide DNA methylation profiles. After controlling for sample composition-attributable variation, we obtained 3,153 CpGs that were differentially methylated between the heavy and light co-twins with nominal significance (P < 0.01), of which only 45 CpGs showed an absolute mean β-value difference >0.05. To verify whether these loci were true BW-MVPs, 8 of these 45 loci were validated using state-of-the-art targeted DBS. When correlating the Infinium with the DBS data for each individual separately, the two technologies gave consistent results and the correlations were high. However, the DBS data did not replicate the DNA methylation differences between the heavy and light co-twins. Nevertheless, when correlating the Infinium with the DBS data for each validated CpG site separately, we observed a wide range of Pearson correlation coefficient values. The highest correlation was observed for the CpG in the buccal epithelium marker PTPN7 (r = 0.91), which served as a positive control, and the buccal content-affected PAPOLA and IGF2BP2 CpGs (r = 0.87 and r = 0.80, respectively) (Table 3). This indicates that true biological variation, linked to the variation of the cell type proportions in saliva samples, is confirmed by DBS. On the other hand, the decreasingly significant correlation values observed for the remaining CpGs indicates low or absent true biologically meaningful variation in the measured DNA methylation levels. The fact that DBS did not replicate the differences between heavy and light co-twins might thus indicate that the few BW-MVPs identified using the HumanMethylation450 assay are the result of technical noise, that is, false positives. This is coherent with the fact that if a more stringent significance criteria had been used to correct for multiple testing, none of the BW-MVPs would have been called significant. In addition, the DAVID tool did not identify enrichments in any of the numerous functional annotation categories for the genes underlying the BW-MVPs [29], indicating that there was no evidence of coordinated DNA methylation changes at BW-MVPs that would reflect potential regulation events in groups of loci., Compared to other widely used genome-wide methylation profiling technologies that are based on methylation-sensitive restriction digestion (HELP (HpaII tiny fragment Enrichment by Ligation-mediated PCR), CHARM) or affinity-based enrichment (MeDIP, MethylCap), the Infinium assay has a higher resolution (single base pair) and therefore expected to have a higher sensitivity [30]. However, whether the Infinium assay is sensitive enough to distinguish between an absolute mean β-value difference of approximately 0.05 to 0.07 is unclear. Bibikova et al. [31] estimated that with the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, on average, β-value differences of 0.14 or larger can be detected, with a higher sensitivity at unmethylated and fully methylated sites (for example, at unmethylated promoters on average β-value changes of approximately 0.07 were detectable). We made an attempt to estimate the technical noise level by examining the 64 SNP probes that are present on the chip. For the twin samples that were heterozygous, the SNP probes showed an absolute intra-pair mean β-value difference of 0.00 to 0.03. Hence, trying to replicate absolute mean β-value differences of 0.05 to 0.07 can be a realistic goal, assuming that all probes on the chip perform as well as these SNP probes. Nonetheless, this is a strong assumption and a number of technical issues are likely to undermine the performance of the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip - for example, differences between the Infinium I and II technologies, multiple CpGs in the probe sequences, cross-hybridization of (repetitive) sequences (for example, PPARGC1B contains Alu element) [32, 33]. On the other hand, whether DBS, which is currently considered as the gold standard, is sensitive enough to replicate a 5% methylation difference is also questionable. On average, we obtained 988 high quality reads per sample per amplicon; thus, the lack of replication is unlikely to be the result of low quality DBS data. Still, in three of the sequenced amplicons informative SNPs were present and for the heterozygous twins a mean absolute intra-pair allele frequency difference of 0.05 to 0.08 was observed. This indicates that DBS also suffers from technical variation, which is probably the result of random bias induced by PCR amplification. Since all currently used diagnostic methods are PCR-based, focusing on small methylation differences might currently not be worthwhile. These aspects should be more carefully considered in EWASs. Taken together, we cannot exclude the possibility that the BW-MVPs identified in this study are false positives. The fact that the detected differences are on the border of technical variation makes it unlikely that they can be regarded as biologically significant., The first EWAS for birth weight was performed on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood of five IUGR neonates and five controls using the HELP assay and identified moderate changes at 56 loci [16]. The authors validated only one locus, the HNF4A promoter, using another technology (bisulfite MassArray). We also analyzed this locus using DBS, but observed no significant differences between the discordant twins. Since the authors studied CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood, our negative results might indicate that the changes they observed do not maintain until adulthood or that they are specific for CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. On the other hand, they only observed a 6% methylation difference between IUGR neonates and controls [16], which remains according to our technical observations difficult to replicate., Currently, six genome-wide DNA methylation studies for birth weight have been published, the details of which are presented in Table 6[16, 34–38]. All of them studied fetal tissues - umbilical cord blood, umbilical vascular endothelial cells and/or placenta. One study used the HELP assay [16], while the other five studies used the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip. In addition, one of the studies [38] also used a twin design (18 MZ and 10 DZ), although the authors did not select the twins based on birth weight discordancy and therefore the mean relative intra-pair birth weight difference of the MZ twins included in their study was only 10.1%. All these EWASs for birth weight reported a number of differentially methylated loci. However, only one gene (PRSS3) was reported by more than one study [16, 34] and none of the loci identified in these studies was significant in our analysis. Moreover, none of these studies performed an intense technical validation comparable to the one made in our study or controlled for sample composition-attributed variation. In summary, while the number of potential candidate loci that become differentially methylated due to an adverse prenatal environment is rapidly growing, the validity of these effects, perhaps with the exception of PRSS3 that was reported by two studies, is questionable since there is no overlap between the reported loci.Table 6

                  , Some studies also examined the relation between birth weight and global DNA methylation levels by assessing repetitive elements. Fryer et al. [34] observed in 12 cord blood samples that LINE1 methylation was higher among the heavier newborns. However, Michels et al. [39] observed in cord blood of 319 newborns a significant correlation between low birth weight, high birth weight and preterm birth with reduced LINE1 methylation, while in placental tissue they observed that low birth weight individuals had higher LINE1 methylation compared to normal birth weight individuals. In addition, Wilhelm-Benartzi et al. [40] observed in 184 placenta samples a positive association between LINE1 and AluYb8 methylation and birth weight. We did not observe any significant differences in LINE1 and HERVK methylation between the heavy and light co-twins, but we observed differences in LINE1 and HERVK methylation between leukocytes and epithelial cells. Further studies should consider such sample composition-attributed variation as it might be responsible for the inconsistent reports concerning global DNA methylation and intra-uterine growth., The majority of the genome-wide methylation studies for birth weight published thus far used a population-based design [16, 34–37]; thus, their outcome variable birth weight suffers from variation induced by gestational age, gender, maternal factors (for example, maternal weight, age, parity) and, most importantly, genetic differences. For all these factors our twin study is controlled and hence methylation variations associated with them should be eliminated. Since we fail to identify any major methylation change, the contribution of such variable factors in data interpretation should be considered more carefully. One might argue that our negative outcome is the result of the shared intra-uterine blood supply of MZ MC twins, which 'diluted' any differential methylation signals. Nevertheless we are aware of this problem and focused on adult twins, since we earlier observed that epigenetic discordance in MZ MC twins, even those that suffered from twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, becomes measurable in saliva when they grow older [27]. Moreover, for twin pair 2 it was recorded that they suffered from twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome in utero. If the severely unbalanced intra-uterine blood flow did have an impact on their leukocyte populations, then for this pair one would expect to see a higher intra-pair correlation, which was not higher than expected on average (Figure S7 in Additional file 1)., Since none of the twins reported in the questionnaire suffer from acute diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, one might reason that our approach enriched for healthy individuals. However, the twins were only recruited based on being very discordant for birth weight and adult health status was never used as an inclusion criterion. In addition, the EFPTS is a prospective and population-based twin registry [19]. Therefore, neither our selection strategy nor the EFPTS ever enriched for healthy individuals. In addition, a medical examination was not conducted for this study, so the actual adult health status of the twins is unknown. Our twin sample is also relatively young and clear symptoms are expected to appear at later ages. Moreover, manifestation of metabolic disorders is strongly related to lifestyle factors., Finally, through the post hoc power calculation presented in Table S7 in Additional file 1, we demonstrate that our approach has sufficient power to detect an absolute mean β-value difference of at least 0.05. To exclude that our negative study outcome is the result of a high false negative rate, we applied a nominal significance threshold of 0.01 (gives approximately 99% power). Note that the statistical analyses show that our design can also easily detect smaller methylation differences, since 3,108 of the 3,153 CpGs having a P < 0.01 in the final analysis showed an absolute mean β-value difference below 0.05. However, these small differences are not reproducible using DBS and thus remain in the range of technical inaccuracy., Our study is based on the assumption that methylation changes caused by a poor prenatal environment remain throughout life in many cell types (systemic). The fact that we used saliva instead of whole blood is, in this respect, an advantage since saliva contains ectoderm- and mesoderm-derived cells, while blood contains only the latter. Nevertheless, our negative results might indicate that the methylation differences are restricted to biologically relevant metabolic tissues (for example, pancreas, liver, muscle, adipose tissue) and thus absent in cells composing saliva. It is also possible that the methylation differences are temporary and are not maintained into adulthood. Due to placental blood vessel connections, blood of young MZ MC birth weight discordant twins is not suitable for epigenetic studies. Studying young MZ DC twins would be an alternative as they do not experience intra-uterine vascular connections, but they are more rare (33% of all MZ twins) and have smaller intra-pair birth weight differences. On the other hand, the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip covers just approximately 2% of all CpGs in the genome and gene bodies and regulatory intergenic regions are underrepresented on the chip. In addition, birth weight discordancy in MZ MC twins can arise from different pathologies and in this respect our group is certainly not homogeneous (for example, different locations of umbilical cord insertion). Despite these limitations, we can conclude that genome-wide and locus specific DNA methylation perturbations are small and not abundant in cells composing saliva (that is, epithelium and leukocytes) of individuals that experienced severe intra-uterine growth restriction."

In mammals, however, the molecular nature of epiallelic variation has been poorly defined, partly due to the restricted focus on DNA methylation. Here we report the first genome-scale investigation of mammalian epialleles that integrates genomic, methylomic, transcriptomic and histone state information., First, in a small sample set, we demonstrate that non-genetically determined inter-individual differentially methylated regions (iiDMRs) can be temporally stable over at least 2 years. Then, we show that iiDMRs are associated with changes in chromatin state as measured by inter-individual differences in histone variant H2A.Z levels. However, the correlation of promoter iiDMRs with gene expression is negligible and not improved by integrating H2A.Z information. We find that most promoter epialleles, whether genetically or non-genetically determined, are associated with low levels of transcriptional activity, depleted for housekeeping genes, and either depleted for H3K4me3/enriched for H3K27me3 or lacking both these marks in human embryonic stem cells. The preferential enrichment of iiDMRs at regions of relative transcriptional inactivity validates in a larger independent cohort, and is reminiscent of observations previously made for promoters that undergo hypermethylation in various cancers, in vitro cell culture and ageing., Our work identifies potential key features of epiallelic variation in humans, including temporal stability of non-genetically determined epialleles, and concomitant perturbations of chromatin state. Furthermore, our work suggests a novel mechanistic link among inter-individual epialleles observed in the context of normal variation, cancer and ageing.","Epigenetics, DNA methylation, epialleles","Epialleles are genomic loci at which the epigenetic state can stably vary among individuals in a given population [1]. Although first described and still best understood in plants [2–4], in recent years we have come to realise that epigenomic landscapes in mammals can also show considerable inter-individual variation (reviewed in [1, 5]). Mammalian epialleles could arise through the action of cis- or trans-genetic influences [6, 7], or have non-genetic origins as a result of: (1) potential stochastic events [8, 9]; (2) exposure to a compromised in utero environment as has been shown in rodent and human studies [10–12]; (3) or adult life-style associated factors such as smoking [13]. Despite these and other previous studies, the molecular nature of mammalian epialleles, in particular those induced by non-genetic factors, has remained controversial [14]. To a large extent, this is due to the DNA methylation-focus of previous investigations [5]. Incorporation of information about the chromatin state would refine our understanding of the molecular nature and ultimately functionality of epialleles in the context of normal variation or disease states., Here we describe the first systematic interrogation of mammalian epialleles that integrates genomic, methylomic, transcriptomic and chromatin state information. Using a combination of experimental and computational analyses we identify key features of epiallelic variation in humans, including demonstrating that even non-genetically determined epialleles can be temporally stable, and that DNA methylation variability at epialleles is associated with concomitant perturbations in chromatin state. Most notably, we find that promoter-associated epiallelic variation is predominantly associated with developmentally important and/or tissue-restricted genes. A similar category of genes is preferentially hyper-methylated in various cancers, in vitro cellular transformation, and human chronological ageing, potentially pointing to a novel mechanistic link between these processes and human inter-individual epiallelic variation., Our data reveal several novel and important features of mammalian epialleles. First, we find that even non-genetically determined epialleles can be temporally stable (at least over the course of 2 years). That is, a significant fraction of these epialleles are not just transient epigenetic perturbations with little prospect of influencing molecular function. Second, inter-individual DNA methylation variants are associated with perturbations of chromatin state, a relationship observed for even small differences, for example, down to approximately 5% methylation difference, and therefore can be considered as bona fide epigenetic perturbations. Of course, future studies using bigger sample numbers are needed to further explore our initial findings., The most significant aspect of our study is the finding that the correlation of iiDMRS with gene expression differences is very weak and that iiDMRs are preferentially found in regions of relative transcriptional inactivity. So what are the implications of this? First, it is possible that some promoter epialleles show inter-related DNA methylation and chromatin state perturbations, but may not impact significantly on genome function, at least as measured by steady state transcriptional activity. In the case of non-genetically determined epialleles, maybe all promoters are potentially subject to epiallelic variation, but the more active ones are 'cleared' of aberrant epigenomic variants, whereas the less active/silent promoters can accumulate epigenetic variation. But the enrichment of epialleles in less active/silent promoters was also found in comparisons between unrelated individuals. Although it is hard to say what proportion of epialleles between unrelated individuals are due to genetic as opposed to environmental differences from our data, the genetic influence on DNA methylation profiles is well documented [3, 4, 25]. Bell and colleagues measured genome-wide methylation in 77 HapMap Yoruba individuals, for which gene expression and genotype data were available, and found a strong genetic component to inter-individual variation in DNA methylation profiles [4]. Although they found a significant enrichment of SNPs that affect both methylation and gene expression, they also noted that the total number of genes showing such a signal is only a small proportion of the total number of methylation variants they identified [4]. A similar conclusion was reached by Myers and colleagues who analysed genome-wide methylation in six members of a three generation family and found that only 22% of genes harbouring genotype-dependent DNA methylation exhibited allele-specific gene expression (albeit more than expected by chance) [25]. Therefore, in both cases the correlation between genetically determined DNA methylation and expression is at best modest, which would be consistent with our results regarding chromatin state., It is possible that epiallelic variation acts in a manner not evident from simple correlations with steady-state expression levels in a given tissue. First it is possible that these correlations are tissue-restricted as has recently been shown for genetically determined tissue-restricted gene expression [26]. Alternatively, conclusions from two recent studies, although not focusing on DNA methylation/chromatin state in mammals, hint at other potential mechanisms by which epialleles could act. Yvert and colleagues recently compared H3K14 acetylation profiles between two strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found 5,442 sites that significantly differed in H3K14ac levels, which they called single nucleosome epi-polymorphisms (SNEPs) [27]. However, higher acetylation in one strain did not always mean higher expression of the relevant gene, for example, in one case the SNEP was associated with the strength of gene activation upon stimulation by heat shock. Secondly, Lindgren and colleagues recently assessed the effect of naturally occurring variation in miRNA expression levels on mRNA levels in humans, but found little correlation [28]. The authors concluded that their findings were more consistent with the primary role of miRNAs being to buffer mRNA levels. A key conclusion therefore is that correlating epialleles with steady-state RNA dynamics, possibly the most common analysis currently presented in papers on epiallelic investigations, may not be particularly fruitful., Finally, and potentially most importantly, the broadly similar characteristics of iiDMRs and aDMRs (from our previous study [20] and [29]) may in fact be a general feature of mammalian epiallelic variation in a variety of contexts. Meissner and colleagues found that aberrant gradual hyper-methylation during in vitro cell culture is found at promoters associated with genes not expressed in that cell type [30]. Additionally, it has been found in a variety of human cancers that bivalent chromatin domains (associated with low transcriptional activity in stem cells) are preferential targets of hyper-methylation [31–33]. The common thread among these seemingly disparate examples of inter-individual epigenetic variation is promoters that are developmentally regulated and tissue-restricted, and are only moderately active, or inactive, in the analysed tissue. We propose that there could be a potentially important mechanistic link between normal/stochastic epiallelic variation and the epigenetic perturbations observed in the context of cancer and ageing., The existence of mammalian epialleles is not in doubt, but the key challenge now is to characterise epialleles at the molecular level. Our work reveals key and novel properties of epiallelic variation in humans, and further suggests important mechanistic links between normal inter-individual epigenetic variation and epigenetic perturbations observed in cancer and chronological ageing., All data are available on GEO [GSE46220]."

However, the mode of action and the function of the piRNA pathway proteins remains elusive, possibly because of their specific expression in the gonads, which makes piRNAs more difficult to study., piRNAs are produced by two mechanisms: the primary processing pathway and secondary biogenesis, which is also called the ping-pong amplification loop. Primary piRNAs are likely processed from single-stranded precursor transcripts that are encoded by heterochromatic loci called piRNA clusters. Secondary piRNAs result from the processing of transposon mRNAs and piRNA clusters by an efficient feed-forward amplification loop. Mutation of piRNA pathway components in several organisms (Bombyx, Drosophila, mice and zebrafish) has provided a better understanding of their functions in the piRNA biogenesis pathways., Ramesh Pillai (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Grenoble, France) showed in both Bombyx
                mori and Drosophila
                melanogaster that the DEAD box domain of an RNA helicase, Vasa, is required for disassembling the ribonucleoprotein complex during secondary biogenesis of piRNAs. He also reported that a mouse Tudor-domain-containing protein, TDRD12, is needed for secondary biogenesis. Emile Brasset (Auvergne University, Clermont-Ferrand, France) reported differences in the spatio-temporal requirement of piRNA pathway components for TE silencing during Drosophila oogenesis using a sensor transgene based on the Idefix transposon. Moreover, in the dividing cysts of the germarium, a component of insect ovaries, she described a time window that she called the 'piwiless pocket', when low piwi expression correlates with loss of repression of the Idefix sensor., To go further in understanding the piRNA pathway in zebrafish, René Ketting (Hubrecht Institute, the Netherlands) studied Tdrd6, a newly identified component of the piRNA pathway. This protein seems to be required for the correct localization of the Argonaute-family protein Ziwi to the nuage, a perinuclear cytoplasmic structure, in embryos, but not for piRNA biogenesis, as only a minor piRNA loss was observed in mutants. Tdrd6 was also reported to be expressed in the ovarian ooplasm's Balbiani body, a transient cytoplasmic structure composed of various organelles. He proposed that Tdrd6 might be involved in maternal transcript inheritance., During spermatogenesis in mice, primordial germ cells undergo massive epigenetic reprogramming as they colonize the fetal gonads, notably in the form of a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation, which correlates with TE expression. Fetal male germ cells specifically express the Argonaute-family proteins Mili and Miwi2, which are responsible for the production of piRNAs through the degradation of transposon mRNAs. Donal O'Carroll (EMBL, Monterotondo, Italy) described a conditional mili mutant in which slicer activity, which is required for the secondary piRNA processing mechanism, was substantially reduced in the pre-leptotene to zygotene stages. He demonstrated that Mili slicer activity is not required for the repression of the L1 retrotransposon during this time window. Transposon silencing is maintained by deposition of the H3K9me2 histone mark, which is lost at the zygotene transition. He showed that L1 silencing requires the orchestration of three distinct mechanisms during spermatogenesis: DNA methylation, histone methylation and post-transcriptional silencing by piRNAs., In S. pombe, non-coding RNAs are involved in the formation of constitutive heterochromatin at pericentromeric regions by orchestrating the deposition of heterochromatin marks. However, to maintain genome homeostasis heterochromatin and euchromatin must be partitioned; centromeric heterochromatin is demarcated from euchromatin by transcriptionally active tRNA genes. Marc Bühler (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland) described a new class of small non-coding RNAs that are produced at the edge of heterochromatin. He suggested that their role was to counteract the spreading of heterochromatic regions that do not have tRNA sequences. These new classes of 22-nucleotide-long RNAs are not loaded onto Argonaute proteins, and they accumulate in dicer1 mutants., Eric Miska (Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge, UK) and Scott Kennedy (Laboratory of Genetics, Madison, USA) reported the role of piRNAs in the regulation of germinal transcripts in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a transcriptomic approach Miska's team showed that the transgenerational sterility observed when the piRNA pathway is abolished in mutants in the Argonaute-family gene prg-1 is not due to loss of genome integrity but rather to accumulation of toxic transcripts derived from short repeats. The presence of these transcripts in the progeny of prg-1 mutant worms caused epigenetic stress leading to sterility. Surprisingly, this phenotype could be rescued by treatment with insulin, although the underlying mechanism is not known., Kennedy and colleagues observed that, in the absence of the nuclear RNAi machinery, nematodes become sterile due to defects in gamete formation and function that become progressively worse over generations. Using a genetic screen, they identified the Argonaute protein HRDE-1 as an actor of multigenerational RNAi inheritance that is essential to maintain the germ-cell lineage. In their model, the deficiency in the RNAi machinery could be correlated with a slow decrease of the H3K9me3 repressive chromatin mark during several generations. Consequently, potentially toxic regions or genes may be transcribed over time, thus destabilizing germline stem cells., Studies in plants, fission yeast and worms suggest that RNA silencing requires mobile RNA regulators that move from cell to cell, and long distance silencing has been shown in plants by grafting plants of one genotype onto another. In Arabidopsis thaliana, long distance cell to cell mobility has been reported for various types of small non-coding RNAs, notably the 21- and 24-nucleotide RNA species implicated in post-transcriptional regulation and transcriptional silencing, respectively. Using a potato grafting model, David Baulcombe (University of Cambridge, UK) demonstrated that production of 24-nucleotide small RNAs in the shoot can cause transmissible transcriptional gene silencing of a target expressed in the tuber. This silencing was associated with promoter methylation in the grafted potatoes, indicating that the epigenome of a plant can be altered to create epigenetically modified plants. Grafting might be a new tool for transferring an epigenetic modifier (specifically, a small RNA) and thus to establish transcriptional silencing by DNA methylation., The suggestion of a role for mobile small non-coding RNAs in gene silencing is also strengthened by work in nematodes. Miska and colleagues have addressed the fundamental question of the possible functions for RNA interference in the life cycle of nematodes in the wild. Several clades of parasitic nematodes, including Brugia malayi, live in symbiosis with intracellular bacteria such as Wolbachia, whereas others, for instance Globodera pallida or Trichinella spiralis, are parasites of plants and animals. By analyzing the small RNA populations of parasitic nematodes, they found that small RNA pathways are conserved between C. elegans and parasitic nematodes. Furthermore, this analysis revealed the presence of host-parasite communication mediated by small RNAs, suggesting that RNA interference may be important for adapting to the environment. The best example is the intramuscular form of the vertebrate parasite T. spiralis, which selectively secretes a miRNA that is homologous to a mammalian miRNA, which then represses muscle differentiation. Given the profound effect of T. spiralis on muscle cell biology, they suggested that parasite miRNAs can influence the expression of host genes., Since the first evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in plants, the idea has been put forward that epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and small RNAs, could contribute to transgenerational inheritance of acquired traits in metazoans as well. Several presentations reported advances in our understanding of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Stephane Ronsseray (UMR7622, CNRS-Paris, France) described the first case of paramutation in insects. Paramutation is the phenomenon in which one allele at a locus induces a heritable epigenetic change of a homologous allele. He has studied a Drosophila homology-dependent silencing mechanism used by the P element transposon to establish its repression, and has found that a stable paramutation (over 70 generations) can be induced simply by maternal inheritance of a cytoplasm that carries piRNAs homologous to the paramutated locus. In order to propagate the phenomenon, the paramutated locus itself becomes a strong producer of piRNAs and is fully paramutagenic. Importantly, paramutation in Drosophila can be induced exclusively by cytoplasmic inheritance and does not require pairing between the paramutagenic and paramutated loci. Séverine Chambeyron (Institute of Human Genetics, Montpellier, IGH, France) showed that the ability to repress the I element retrotransposon in the Drosophila female germline behaves like a chromatin-independent acquired epigenetic trait that is exclusively transmitted over generations by the piRNAs that are maternally deposited in the Drosophila embryo., In mammals, environmental changes, stress and diet may cause a wide range of metabolic and cellular disorders that can be transmitted through several generations. The challenge is to demonstrate that the transmitted traits are indeed epigenetic traits and not a consequence of heritable genetic changes. Erica Watson (University of Cambridge, UK) developed an approach based on the mutation of a gene essential for folate metabolism (Mtrr) to analyze the transgenerational effects of abnormal folate metabolism on mammalian development. Mtrr deficiency in the maternal grandparents is sufficient to cause abnormal mouse development (intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay and congenital malformations) in the wild-type grand-progeny. Embryo transfer experiments performed to eliminate environmental maternal effects indicate epigenetic inheritance as a mechanism, the results of which persist for at least four generations., Isabelle Mansuy (University of Zurich, Switzerland) developed a mouse model to test whether early postnatal stress contributes to severe behavioral and metabolic impairment in the progeny. By examining the profile of small RNAs in male germ cells of F1 animals she identified an alteration of the expression of several classes of small RNAs. Injection of small RNAs from stressed males into fertilized mouse oocytes reproduced the same behavioral and metabolic symptoms, strongly suggesting that small RNAs could be the molecules responsible for epigenetic inheritance in this system., Finally, an intergenerational epigenetic inheritance study using a mouse model of prenatal undernutrition or protein-restriction was presented by Anne Ferguson-Smith (University of Cambridge, UK). In Ferguson-Smith's model, the F1 and F2 progeny of undernourished animals (F0) showed low birth weight, defects in glucose tolerance, and an impaired glucose-stimulated insulin response. F0 animals were subjected to nutritional restriction during the third week of pregnancy, a period that coincides with the time of re-acquisition of genome-wide methylation, including at imprinting control regions in the male primordial germ cells. Changes in DNA methylation of imprinted genes in the F1 and F2 generations were not identified, suggesting that prenatal undernutrition does not perturb the functional monoallelicism of imprinted genes and their mechanisms of epigenetic regulation., In recent years, genetic approaches performed in a number of model organisms have been critically important for developing models of the molecular bases for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. These findings highlight the importance of non-coding RNAs and their influence on DNA. The next steps will be to fully characterize the mechanistic details of these processes, and the extent to which they are able to be transmitted over generations."

After including RNA-seq data from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and ESC-derived neural progenitor cells (ESC-NPCs) to increase coverage of potential lncRNAs, the authors used ab initio transcriptome reconstruction to identify 8,992 lncRNAs that derived from 5,731 genomic loci. To incorporate lncRNAs that might have been missed by short-read Illumina-based sequencing, the authors employed long-read RNA CaptureSeq to sequence SVZ cDNAs hybridized to probe libraries that tiled across 100 Mbp of putative lncRNA loci. The additional >3,500 lncRNAs brought the number of lncRNAs identified in neuronal lineages in vivo to an unprecedented >12,000, which is two- to three-fold more than previously known (see Mitchell Guttman et al. [6], for example). The surprising increase in the number of lncRNAs was explained by the focus of previous studies on only one or a combination of a few closely related cell or tissue types. This focus would inherently fail to capture certain sets of lncRNAs, given the finding that lncRNAs exhibit greater spatiotemporal expression specificity than mRNAs ([7], see below). Furthermore, previous studies were limited by the use of relatively insensitive techniques. For instance, custom microarrays do not cover the entire transcriptome, and Illumina-based RNA-seq rarely picks up lower abundance transcripts, many of which are lncRNAs., Considering that lncRNA expression is highly specific to cell type and strictly regulated during development, those lncRNAs identified by Ramos et al. [7] are anticipated to be only part of the mouse lncRNA repertoire. Thus, it is likely that the number of lncRNAs in other organisms has been underestimated as well, since no other thorough genome- and developmental-wide analysis has been performed. It follows that existing underestimates of lncRNA numbers are accompanied by an under-appreciation of lncRNA functions, some of which have been conserved through evolution from zebrafish to humans [8]., The finding that lncRNAs exhibit greater spatiotemporal expression specificity than do mRNAs - a finding that derived in part from published RNA-seq data from different regions of the mouse brain and during different stages of mouse brain development - indicated that lncRNAs have specific spatiotemporal roles. Thus, equally as important as identifying lncRNAs is determining lncRNA expression patterns. To map the expression patterns of lncRNAs in distinct cell types in vivo, Ramos et al. [7] used specific markers and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort SVZ-derived cells that represent the three main neurogenic cell types - namely, activated NSCs, transit-amplifying cells and migratory neuroblasts - and they did likewise for niche astrocytes. The authors then interrogated the cDNAs generated from these cells using a microarray of probes corresponding to the lncRNAs that they had previously identified. They found a unique lncRNA expression pattern for each of the three stages of neurogenesis analyzed that can be distinguished from the expression pattern in niche astrocytes. Thus, the differential expression of lncRNAs at different stages of the same lineage likely contributes to the specification of these stages., In addition, Ramos and co-workers [7] found that lncRNAs are transcriptionally regulated in a manner analogous to mRNAs. Using ChIP-seq, they showed that, as for mRNAs dynamically regulated in neurogenesis, the transcription start sites (TSSs) of many of the identified lncRNAs had both an activating and a repressive histone mark (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, respectively) in NSCs. With this bivalent mark, their promoters are held inactive but poised for either activation or repression upon differentiation via loss of either one of the histone modifications. The presence of these marks was consistent with the expression patterns of the particular lncRNAs as determined using microarrays. These findings enable the prediction of lncRNAs that may function in NSC maintenance and/or differentiation. The authors have incorporated their annotations of putative lncRNAs that derive from RNA-seq and RNA CaptureSeq, along with lncRNA expression patterns determined using microarray analyses, into an online database [7]. This lncRNA identification and expression analysis pipeline constitutes an important resource for future analyses of lncRNA function in the mouse brain and during SVZ neurogenesis., Ramos et al. [7] used their newly established pipeline to predict lncRNAs that may function in SVZ neurogenesis. One of these lncRNAs, Six3os, was expressed specifically in NSCs but not in subsequently differentiated cells. Downregulating Six3os using a short-hairpin RNA reduced by two-fold the number of NSCs that after differentiation stained positive for the neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (TUJ1), indicating a Six3os short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated defect in neurogenesis., While only a few identified lncRNAs were functionally validated, results demonstrate the utility of the authors' workflow to predict with high confidence lncRNAs that function in the neurogenic process. Notably, when the authors generated different transcript modules, consisting of lncRNAs and known protein-coding transcripts whose variation in expression typify a brain region or brain developmental stage, they found that some modules are closely related to human neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease and so on. This suggests that lncRNAs classified into such modules are potentially associated with these diseases. For example, 88 lncRNAs were found in a module that correlates with a gene expression set that is misregulated in mouse models of Huntington's disease, implying potential roles for these lncRNAs in this neurodegenerative condition. More than solving the argument of whether these lncRNAs have functional relevance, it now becomes imperative to understand lncRNA function in order to understand how they contribute to neurodegenerative disorders., The study by Ramos et al. [7] has provided a generalizable way to comprehensively identify novel functional transcripts (Figure 1a). This is of special significance given that lncRNAs are playing more roles in cellular functions than originally anticipated (Figure 1b). These roles pertain not only to neurogenesis but also to embryogenesis [9], myogenesis [10] and likely many other processes. With such workflows, researchers can begin constructing more complete functional genomics maps for different cell types and from various developmental stages. These maps will help to unravel mammalian gene expression networks and provide a basis for the study of the largely uninvestigated but clearly diverse roles of lncRNAs in normal and disease-associated cellular metabolism.

Twins provide an ideal model with which to investigate these influences but previous cross-sectional twin studies provide contradictory evidence of within-pair epigenetic drift over time. Longitudinal twin studies can potentially address this discrepancy., In a pilot, genome-scale study of DNA from buccal epithelium, a relatively homogeneous tissue, we show that one-third of the CpGs assayed show dynamic methylation between birth and 18 months. Although all classes of annotated genomic regions assessed show an increase in DNA methylation over time, probes located in intragenic regions, enhancers and low-density CpG promoters are significantly over-represented, while CpG islands and high-CpG density promoters are depleted among the most dynamic probes. Comparison of co-twins demonstrated that within-pair drift in DNA methylation in our cohort is specific to a subset of pairs, who show more differences at 18 months. The rest of the pairs show either minimal change in methylation discordance, or more similar, converging methylation profiles at 18 months. As with age-associated regions, sites that change in their level of within-pair discordance between birth and 18 months are enriched in genes involved in development, but the average magnitude of change is smaller than for longitudinal change., Our findings suggest that DNA methylation in buccal epithelium is influenced by non-shared stochastic and environmental factors that could reflect a degree of epigenetic plasticity within an otherwise constrained developmental program.","","Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play an important role in development, ageing and disease [1–3]. However, the factors that influence epigenetic dynamics are poorly understood. Twin studies have the potential to estimate genetic components of epigenetic state [4, 5] and have demonstrated that gene expression and DNA methylation profiles can both be influenced by allelic, stochastic and environmental factors [6–10]. Non-shared environmental and stochastic factors together have been estimated to be the largest influence on promoter methylation in utero [7]., Studies of epigenetic change over time have predominantly used cross-sectional approaches and have focused on adults [11–17] or on intrauterine development [18, 19]. A small number of such studies have assessed age-associated DNA methylation across wider time-spans, encompassing childhood, adolescence and adulthood [20–23]. Consistently, age-associated changes in DNA methylation are more likely to involve (1) increases in methylation; (2) genes associated with development, signaling and regulation of transcription; and (3) regions involved in epigenetic reprogramming during embryonic stem cell differentiation [12, 14]. Since most of these studies have focused on CpG islands and promoter regions, age-associated epigenetic changes are incompletely characterized in relation to genomic coverage and life-course., Longitudinal studies investigating aging and longevity have distinct advantages over cross-sectional designs, particularly in relation to controlling for genetic variation. For example, longitudinal studies directly query temporal sequences and pathways and individuals are studied rather than group averages. Longitudinal, array-based studies in blood from children in the first 1 to 5 years of postnatal life have shown similar results to adult studies with respect to gene function, genomic location and direction of age-related changes in DNA methylation, with the majority of age-related changes being observed in regions flanking CpG islands [24–26]. In adults, a high-resolution array-based study found a mixture of age-stable and age-dynamic variability throughout the methylome in adults [27]. Other studies of global DNA methylation in adults also showed a genetic influence on increase and decrease in DNA methylation [28] and a decrease in interspersed repeat DNA methylation over time [29]., A small number of epigenetic studies of ageing have focused specifically on twins. Cross-sectional studies have found that older monozygotic (MZ) twins differ more with respect to global and repetitive DNA methylation [30], a phenomenon referred to as 'epigenetic drift'. In contrast, using DNA from saliva, no evidence for such drift was found within MZ twins aged 21 to 55 years using a promoter/CpG island array [15]. A cross-sectional comparison of DNA methylation at the imprinted IGF2/H19 locus in adolescent and middle-aged MZ twins also found no evidence of epigenetic drift within pairs [31]. To our knowledge, only one study has examined DNA methylation in twins longitudinally, measuring three loci in buccal DNA from 46 MZ pairs and 45 dizygotic (DZ) pairs at 5 and 10 years of age [8]. This study revealed (1) locus-specific variability in DNA methylation; (2) change over time in individuals; (3) within-pair correlation and (4) epigenetic drift. Taken together, these studies show that epigenetic change over time is likely to be regulated by many factors, potentially in a tissue-specific and genome context-dependent manner. Longitudinal epigenetic studies in twins offer tremendous potential to further our understanding of the relationship between genetics and other factors that specify inter-individual temporal change in DNA methylation profile in humans., We have used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (HM450) platform, which interrogates >485,000 CpG dinucleotides and contains probes from CpG islands, shores (2 kb regions flanking CpG islands), shelves (2 kb regions flanking shores), sites from 1,500 bp upstream of transcription start sites through to gene bodies and 3' UTRs, in addition to intergenic regions, regions involved in epigenetic reprogramming during embryonic stem cell differentiation and enhancers [32, 33]. Although repeats are not covered by these arrays and intergenic regions are not covered to the same depth as genic regions, the platform represents a significant step towards genome-scale coverage. Using the Infinium HM450 platform, we have performed a longitudinal study of DNA methylation at birth and age 18 months in DNA from buccal swabs from 10 MZ and 5 DZ twin pairs from the Peri/postnatal Epigenetic Twins Study (PETS) cohort [34]. We report a large degree of epigenetic change during the first 18 months of postnatal life, with strong regional genomic biases for rate of change over time. We also present evidence for pair-specific levels of epigenetic change, suggesting a complex interplay between environment, non-shared environment and stochastic factors in molding the early postnatal epigenome., This study, examining DNA methylation profiles in buccal cells of young twins, has further confirmed the highly dynamic nature of the human epigenome postnatally, in agreement with previous studies in other tissues [20, 21, 24–26, 43]. Buccal cells represent a key bio-resource for age- and disease-associated epigenetic association studies [8, 12, 44, 45]. From a previous study [46] and our own unpublished data, this sample type comprises >90% squamous epithelial cells with <10% blood cells. Moreover, we minimized cell heterogeneity due to immune reactions by not collecting from infants with mouth infections. Almost a third of all HM450 probes in our final dataset showed significantly changed DNA methylation levels at FDR <0.05. Furthermore, the average absolute methylation change in these aDMPs was 4.7% (3.2% per year over 18 months) and almost 3% of aDMPs exhibited an absolute methylation change of >20%. These changes are similar in magnitude to those seen in blood from birth to one year of age using HM27 arrays and FDR <0.05 (3.9% of probes with changes >20%; average change of 9.2% per year) [24] and in T cells from birth to one year of age using HM450 arrays and FDR <0.01 (2.7% of probes with changes >20%; average change of 14% per year) [25]. In addition, our findings are of similar magnitude to a cross-sectional study of DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex from human cadavers using HM27 arrays [47]. In combination with other cross-sectional studies [20, 22], these cumulative data support the idea that rate of change of DNA methylation in the genome in any one tissue is highest in utero, possibly reflecting extensive cellular differentiation during organogenesis, and then declines in childhood, with a further drop in adulthood [20, 21, 43]., In the current study, most (approximately 90%) age-associated changes involved an increase in DNA methylation over time. This agrees with previous longitudinal studies of early childhood [24–26] and cross-sectional studies of placenta throughout gestation [48], peripheral blood in children [20], peripheral blood in adults [12, 13, 16], buccal cells in adults [12] and in a comparison of differences in various tissues between fetal and adult tissues [22]. A recent study comparing the entire methylomes of a newborn and a centenarian using bisulfite sequencing [23] observed an age-associated decrease in methylation in most genomic regions, including interspersed repetitive DNA, intergenic and intragenic regions. Although additional studies are needed to reconcile these discrepancies, it is also likely that age-associated methylation changes are dependent on genomic and tissue context, on the methylation analysis platform used and on sample size., We found that aDMRs are more likely to be in intergenic and intragenic regions (Figure 3). Such regions were also enriched in aDMRs identified in multiple tissues in rats [49] and mice [50]. The intergenic regions identified in our study are single copy and overlap with enhancers (Figure 3). Such regions undergo the most dynamic changes accompanying differentiation of pluripotent stem cells [51]. Almost a third of aDMPs identified, and almost a half of aDMRs, lay within 5 kb of transcriptional start sites (Figure S2 in Additional file 1), implicating such regions in the regulation of gene expression. The higher proportion of aDMRs (44%) compared to aDMPs (29%) around gene promoters most likely reflects the higher CpG density and co-methylation (locally correlated methylation) within these regions [52]. However, this could also be due at least in part to the relatively wider HM450 probe spacing in intergenic regions., Ontology and pathways analysis showed that approximately three quarters of the genes associated with stringent aDMPs and all aDMRs are implicated in development and morphogenesis (Tables 2 and 3; Table S2 in Additional file 2). Signaling pathways, including those based on GTPase signal transduction, pathways intrinsic to development, were also enriched, as has been observed in other studies of age-associated changes in methylation [50, 53]. A bias towards genes involved in development has been seen in cross-sectional [13, 20, 54, 55] and longitudinal [25, 27] studies of human aging and in a study of embryonic stem cell differentiation [53]., It is interesting to note that approximately half of the top ten aDMP ontologies related to neural development (Table 2), a finding shared with previous studies of methylation in saliva [15] and blood cell fractions and buccal epithelium from adults [12] and in a large meta-analysis of multiple HM27 datasets from human brain and blood [55]. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether these findings relate to biases related to the large proportion of the genome expressed in the brain., We found that despite a trend towards increased methylation with age in all regions of the genome, CpG-dense promoter regions were particularly depleted in aDMRs and CpG-poor promoters were moderately increased (Figure 3), contrary to previous cross-sectional [13, 15, 16, 56] and longitudinal [26] studies of ageing-associated methylation change. This disagreement is most likely because HM27 arrays are enriched in CpG-dense CpG islands. However, our data agree with findings from studies using methods that include intergenic regions, that low CpG density promoters are enriched in mouse aDMRs [50], during differentiation of human embryonic stem cells [57] and between birth and very old age [23]., We have conducted the first longitudinal study of epigenetic change in buccal cells in twins from birth, using a validated, genome-scale methylation array. We have shown evidence that the epigenetic profile of both MZ and DZ twin pairs can exhibit epigenetic drift or convergence early in postnatal development. As genes involved in development exhibited the largest absolute changes in methylation over time and the largest, smaller-scale changes within twin pairs, we conclude that the epigenetically driven developmental program is influenced to some extent by stochastic and/or non-shared environmental factors. Thus, canalization may be influenced by such factors, in addition to genetic factors as suggested by Waddington [72, 73]."

It was domesticated in Asia about 7,000 years ago, and cultivated for its rhizomes and seeds as a food crop. It is particularly noted for its 1,300-year seed longevity and exceptional water repellency, known as the lotus effect. The latter property is due to the nanoscopic closely packed protuberances of its self-cleaning leaf surface, which have been adapted for the manufacture of a self-cleaning industrial paint, Lotusan., The genome of the China Antique variety of the sacred lotus was sequenced with Illumina and 454 technologies, at respective depths of 101× and 5.2×. The final assembly has a contig N50 of 38.8 kbp and a scaffold N50 of 3.4 Mbp, and covers 86.5% of the estimated 929 Mbp total genome size. The genome notably lacks the paleo-triplication observed in other eudicots, but reveals a lineage-specific duplication. The genome has evidence of slow evolution, with a 30% slower nucleotide mutation rate than observed in grape. Comparisons of the available sequenced genomes suggest a minimum gene set for vascular plants of 4,223 genes. Strikingly, the sacred lotus has 16 COG2132 multi-copper oxidase family proteins with root-specific expression; these are involved in root meristem phosphate starvation, reflecting adaptation to limited nutrient availability in an aquatic environment., The slow nucleotide substitution rate makes the sacred lotus a better resource than the current standard, grape, for reconstructing the pan-eudicot genome, and should therefore accelerate comparative analysis between eudicots and monocots.","","Sacred lotus, so named because of its religious significance in both Buddhism and Hinduism, belongs to the small plant family Nelumbonaceae, with only one genus, Nelumbo, and two species: N. nucifera (Asia, Australia, Russia) and N. lutea (eastern and southern North America) [1]. Lotus is in the eudicot order Proteales, which lies outside of the core eudicots (Figure S1 in Additional file 1); its closest relatives are shrubs or trees belonging to the families Proteaceae and Platanaceae. Lotus was a land plant that has adapted to aquatic environments., Used as a food for over 7,000 years in Asia, lotus is cultivated for its edible rhizomes, seeds and leaves. Its buds, flowers, anthers, stamens, fruits, leaves, stalks, rhizomes and roots have been used as herbal medicines for treatment of cancer, depression, diarrhea, heart problems, hypertension and insomnia [2, 3]. Its seeds have exceptional longevity, remaining viable for as long as 1,300 years, and its vegetative rhizomes remain healthy for more than 50 years [1, 2]. The nanoscopic closely packed protuberances of its self-cleaning leaf surface have been adapted in Europe for the manufacture of a 'self-cleaning' industrial paint, Lotusan. The use of this paint results in the so-called lotus effect that is now widely advertised for self-cleaning automobiles, buildings and fabrics., Here, we report the sequencing and analysis of the sacred lotus genome, which descends from the most ancient lineage of angiosperms. We have studied the evolutionary history of the genome and genes involved in relevant processes governing the unique features of this ancient land plant, including its adaptation to aquatic environments., Paleopolyploids are widespread among eukaryotes and particularly common in angiosperms [14, 15]. Lotus diverged from other eudicots early in eudicot history, prior to the γ genome-triplication characteristic of most members of the group [14, 15, 17, 26], and provides insight into the timing and nature of this event associated with a rapid radiation of the large eudicot lineages. When plant genomes of high paleopolyploidy levels are compared, differentiated gene loss (fractionation) among several homologous subgenomes tends to diminish the signals of synteny. In such cases, genomes with few paleopolyploidy events (such as those of grape or papaya) can be used to take advantage of the smaller evolutionary distances between orthologous segments. Extensive collinearity within itself, as well as with other plant genomes such as those of Arabidopsis, grape, rice and sorghum, makes the lotus genome not only a eudicot evo-genomic reference (Figure S9 in Additional file 1), but also a better resource for reconstructing the pan-eudicot genome and facilitating comparative analysis between eudicots and monocots., Surprisingly, the phylogenomic analysis of gene families associated with the γ include a substantial fraction of eudicot-wide duplications, suggesting the possibility of a two-step model that involved genetic material from a lineage that branched off earlier than the core eudicots (Figure 3A). A substantial fraction of eudicot-wide gene duplications was also observed in phylogenomic analyses that contained large collections of transcriptome data from early branching basal eudicots such as Platanus, Aquilegia and poppies [26]. Eudicot-wide duplications were detected only rarely in another phylogenomic analysis that introduced transcriptome data from the basal eudicots Gunnera and Pachysandra [29]. The 34 unigenes available from that study were used to populate five MADS box orthogroups with larger taxon sampling in this study. Phylogenies of these orthogroups identify (at boostrap >50%) one eudicot-wide and three core-eudicot-wide duplications (Table S11 in Additional file 1), consistent with the rest of the findings in the present study., In contrast to the phylogenomic results, syntenic comparison showed one lotus region matched with up to three Vitis homologous regions, indicating that the lotus genome did not share the γ event. We propose that the γ event occurred after the separation of the lotus lineage (Proteales), and involved hybridization with a now extinct species that branched off around the same time (Figure 3A, AA at position #2), or even earlier than lotus (Figure 3A, AA at position #3). This model explains why the phylogenomic analyses could identify some γ duplications occurring before the divergence of lotus, but not observable as a triplication in the lotus genome structure. A similar two-step model was suggested by Lyons et al. [30] on the basis of fractionation patterns seen in Vitis, and evidence for a two-step hexaploid process is clearly observed in the much more recent paleohexaploid Brassica rapa [31]. Additional whole plant genome sequences from lineages close to the γ event, especially ones without the confounding effects of lineage-specific genome duplications, may also help to clarify genome-wide patterns of fractionation among the three γ subgenomes, which could provide further evidence bearing on the timing and event(s) associated with the γ paleohexaploidy event that is associated with what is arguably one of the most important radiations in angiosperm history., The higher homeolog retention rate in lotus compared with most other genomes studied provided an opportunity to study subfunctionalization [32], a major driving force affecting fates of duplicated genes following paleopolyploidy. Most pairs of lotus homeologs have no difference in PFAM domain families, whereas 453 pairs (11.6%) differ by up to five domains. The unshared domains have mean length 17 amino acids with a range of 0 to 890 amino acids. Between homeologous lotus gene pairs, mRNA length (excluding 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions), coding sequence length, and intron length differences all follow geometric-like distributions (Figure S10 in Additional file 1), consistent with independent accumulation of small insertions and deletions. The changes of length in exonic and intronic regions seem uncorrelated, implying that subfunctionalization affects gene regulation at multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels., When divergence of lineages is followed by WGD, one predicts similar divergence of the paralogs in one species' genome from a shared ortholog in the other species, confirmed in previous studies [16, 33]. Comparison of paired λ paralogs and their grape ortholog generally fit this prediction (Figure S11 in Additional file 1); however, comparisons to cereal (sorghum) orthologs show consistent differentiation in branch lengths. This discrepancy in the lotus-cereal comparison could be explained by fast evolutionary rates in cereal genomes and/or λ being older than it appears, due to the slow Nelumbo evolutionary rate. Alternatively, this is also consistent with structural compartmentalization, with genes within the same genome undergoing different evolutionary trajectories [33]. Wider taxa sampling at neighboring branches will help better distinguish the possibilities., The extraordinary seed longevity and vegetative propagation via rhizomes are likely the causes of the slow evolutionary rate in lotus. The 'China Antique' has a highly homozygous genome, yielding arguably the best assembled genome using next-generation sequencing technologies with pseudo-molecules proportional to its karyotype. The lotus genome provides the foundation for revealing the molecular basis of its many distinguishing biological properties, including seed longevity, adaptation to aquatic environment, the distinctive superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning property of its leaves, and the thermogenesis that is thought to enhance its pollination success., Sacred lotus is the first true aquatic plant to be sequenced and comparative genomics reveal unique gene family expansions that may have contributed to its adaptations to an aquatic environment. Submersed soils are largely hypoxic and have a decreased reduction-oxidation potential, causing heavy metal precipitation and reduced nutrient availability. Lotus has a dramatic expansion of the COG2132 family, a group of multi-copper oxidases involved in phosphate starvation in root meristems. A role in root-specific processes is supported by the expression of these unique genes in root tissue. Adaptation to phosphate starvation can also be seen in an expansion of the UBC24 family and the miR399 family that regulates it. Lotus lacks four bHLH subfamilies involved in iron uptake and root hair and root meristem development, suggesting novel root growth and iron regulation. These gene family expansions and preferential retention of duplicated genes reflect the challenges of aquatic growth., Sacred lotus has many unique biological features, most noticeable seed longevity and the lotus effect, in addition to its agricultural and medicinal importance. The purpose of sequencing the lotus genome is to facilitate research in these areas and on agronomic and horticultural traits such as rhizome development and flowering time. The assembly of the lotus genome is surprisingly high quality, largely due to the high level of homozygosity resulting from domestication and vegetative propagation. The lotus genome has a lineage-specific WGD event that occurred about 65 MYA, but shows no structural evidence for the γ hexaploid event shared among core eudicot species. The lotus genome has a 30% slower nucleotide mutation rate than that of grape, contributing in part to the outstanding genome assembly using next-generation sequencing technologies. Analysis of sequenced plant genomes yielded a minimum gene set for vascular plants of 4,223 genes. Strikingly, lotus has 16 COG2132 multi-copper oxidase family proteins with root-specific expression. COG2132 members are involved in root meristem phosphate starvation, reflecting lotus' adaptation to limited nutrient availability in an aquatic environment. The slow nucleotide substitution rate and the lack of the triplication event make lotus genome an excellent reference for reconstructing the pan-eudicot genome and for accelerating comparative analysis between eudicots and monocots. The lotus genome will accelerate the identification of genes controlling rhizome yield and quality, seed size and nutritional profile, flower morphology, and flowering time for crop improvement., Illumina (Illumina HiSeq 2000) libraries were generated from purified N. nucifera 'China Antique' nuclear DNA with inserts of 180 bp, 500 bp, 3.8 kb and 8 kb and assembled using ALLPATHS-LG. 454/Roche (GSFLX pyrosequencing platform) 20 kb mate pair reads were used for scaffolding. RNAseq data generated from various lotus tissues were used for annotation and RNAseq differential gene expression analysis using CLC Genomics Workbench 5.0 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark). MAKER version 2.22 was used in combination with the assembled RNAseq data to annotate 26,685 genes in the lotus genome.

You could envisage performing the same experiment every few months and making fresh discoveries while staring at the same slide... You would not need new ideas to keep publishing interesting findings. Does this sound at all familiar? It should do, because it's pretty close to what we have been doing in the genomics field for the last 10 years or so., We, that is genomicists, have been spoiled. We have been real-estate agents working in a housing boom; bankers trading in debt. We have not been made to work; worse still, there has been very little incentive to think. While we have been sliding down the NHGRI sequencing-cost graph we have constantly been fed a high-calorie diet of technical improvements that have led to startlingly obvious (but interesting) discovery experiments to perform; experiments that were impossible or too costly only months previously. What do you do after you have sequenced a human genome? Sequence 1,000 human genomes [1]! When you have done that, sequence 2,000 human genomes [2], sequence their microbiomes [3], sequence their transcriptomes [4], sequence Earth [5]. These are all sensible things to do, the only reason they had not been carried out before is because they couldn't. Many (but not all) genomic experiments are not ingenious or elegant, they are brute force discovery projects made possible by clever technology. The technology has been doing the thinking for us. But, as with all exponential trends in ecosystems or economies, the party always has to come to an end., So what does it mean for us now that the cost-graph has turned against us? Well, for a start, it means that what is possible next year will be the same as what had been possible last year. No new doors will be opened by cheaper, faster sequencing. This means that new ideas will have a higher premium than before. The funders of genomic science will also have to learn to expect more expensive experiments. They have been used to being offered more for less; but now, more will simply cost more. Also, we will have to stop promising a future of cheap genomes that will make our research relevant to the clinic. I have heard many conference presentations where the justification for a specific genomic assay is 'because soon it will be so cheap and easy that every doctor will have one in his office'. Clearly this is not inevitable - certainly not soon. So translation will have to come from what we have now, not what we expect to have tomorrow., 'But...', I hear you scream, '...this is a temporary blip. Soon we will be saved by new cool technology that will plug into my laptop and sequence a genome for $10 in an hour'. In reality, is this just something we simply want to believe? There really is no reason to think that sequencing methodology is about to undergo a revolution in the near future., I am always amazed at the self-inflicted hype that follows any hint of a story where some company has come across a new way of sequencing that is going to turn all our Illumina kits into oversized doorstops. Often this comes not from the companies themselves but the scientists who are so desperate to buy them. The hype is usually followed by hyper-critical twitter and blog commentaries when the machine in question does not appear to do what we want it to (see this revealing interview with Oxford Nanopore's Clive Brown [6]), in a cycle that has repeated itself at least three times in the last 5 years. I begin to wonder why we don't learn from history., Like addicts chasing a high, our anger at being denied a technology fix is born out of irrational desperation. The fact of the matter is that even if Oxford Nanopore (or someone) were to deliver a revolutionary technology this year, the crunch will happen soon. At some point, the exponential decrease in sequencing costs will stop again and we will have to work with a static technology base for a prolonged period., Sometimes what is good for you hurts; like exercise, vaccinations and teaching. Any decent economist will tell you - stability is generally a good thing, and genomics could benefit from a time of reflection and consolidation, where we can simply plan for the long-term without the threat of disruptive technologies instantly obsoleting our efforts. The losers in this stagnation of costs may well be the 'big science' experiments. I have no doubt that they tend to seem cooler to funders in a scenario where the sample numbers are forever increasing owing to decreasing data generation costs. However, I for one am more excited by a world where, instead of chasing bigger numbers and deeper coverage, we invest more resources into exploring the true potential of the technology that we currently have. And if we stop looking for a new technology on the horizon, maybe one will turn up."
"140","How to evaluate a graduate studentship, or choosing the right doctoral advisor","Duncan T Odom","Cancer Research UK - Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge","Duncan T Odom","Duncan.Odom@cruk.cam.ac.uk","29 April 2013","","","This article is written for someone who is passionate about science, and who knows that having a doctorate is the first magical step toward a principal investigator position in a research institute or a university. You have made all the right moves so far in your undergraduate studies; so you have (a) solid to excellent grades, and (b) done substantial amounts of research with a faculty member who can vouch for your competence (this means by the way, ideally more than a year). Now, famous people in storied places as diverse as MIT, Oxford and Singapore have invited you to interview for PhD studentships, which means you have been favorably evaluated by these programs. Congratulations!, But...how do you evaluate them: that is, the group leaders whose studentships are offered to you? In other words, how do you maximize the chances of surviving the next five (all too often brutal) years of your professional life?, My advice is based on my own experiences as a graduate student in chemistry (at Caltech, 5 years), a postdoctoral fellow in genomics (at the Whitehead and MIT, 6 years), and a faculty member in comparative and functional genomics (at University of Cambridge, 6 years). I currently run a medium-sized research group with a steady state of two to four postdocs, two to three graduate students, and about four staff scientists of various flavors. Here, I emphasize points relevant to biological sciences, but some of the ideas are applicable more widely., To begin, let's ask a quick, basic, rarely-asked question. What do you need to accomplish as a graduate student in order to get a great postdoctoral position, from which you could launch a high-caliber faculty job? Although many accomplishments might be desirable, the most basic is this:, You must obtain your doctoral degree in a reasonable amount of time (think: ideally less than five years) with (1) an intact, enthusiastic spirit of curiosity, unbroken by terrible experiences, and (2) at least one solid, first-author publication that has been peer-reviewed., This clear, unambiguous goal for survival should really help guide your choice of graduate advisor with open and critical eyes. Working in a Nobel-winning laboratory and producing publications in the highest impact journals might be ideal, but might not be a realistic (or even desirable) strategy for surviving your first years as a young scientist. Since the biggest variable you can control for is the scientific identity and character of your PhD advisor, you should evaluate this before you join a laboratory., The easiest situation to evaluate is the established laboratory, where you should start by asking hard-nosed questions about their prior record, both in general, and specifically with graduate students' training., With a newly minted junior group leader, you probably have less actual history to go on. However, you can certainly ask them questions about what kind of lab they intend to build., 
                How many people do they want/intend to have in the lab in five years? In what roles? Why?
              , Most senior postdocs do not think strongly about these issues, as most of their efforts are spent in trying to get a faculty position. However, the starting group leaders who have thought these issues through would be expected to be more prepared to train promising graduate students like you. There are powerful advantages of starting work for a very junior group, not least that your interests and theirs are exactly aligned in ways that senior group leaders cannot be. In particular, untenured group leaders will be wanting your first stories published at least as much as you do, possibly more., An aside: I believe that the first four or five people who join a nascent laboratory have the best chances of hitting a scientific gold mine. It does, however, require courage to take a chance on an unknown group leader., With a medically trained group leader, you have a huge advantage in easier access to patient materials, which facilitates looking at questions directly relating to human disease biology. But there are certain drawbacks., 
                What is the allocation of the clinician-scientist's time between clinic and lab?
              , Many clinician scientists stay engaged with patient care, which is often an excellent strategy, but the cost of this dedication can at times be how much attention they can give their laboratory. Furthermore, many areas of translational medicine are scientifically over-subscribed and extraordinarily competitive. Remember that as long as you, as a grad student, get your solid publication or two, you are fine. However, if the clinician-scientist group leader is aiming for a big splash in a top-tier journal, then lower-impact stories that make up the bedrock of a successful graduate studentship might get neglected along the way., Good luck!"

How these signatures relate to one another in biological and prognostic contexts remains to be clarified., To investigate the relationship between proliferation and immune gene signatures, we analyzed an integrated dataset of 1,954 clinically annotated breast tumor expression profiles randomized into training and test sets to allow two-way discovery and validation of gene-survival associations. Hierarchical clustering revealed a large cluster of distant metastasis-free survival-associated genes with known immunological functions that further partitioned into three distinct immune metagenes likely reflecting B cells and/or plasma cells; T cells and natural killer cells; and monocytes and/or dendritic cells. A proliferation metagene allowed stratification of cases into proliferation tertiles. The prognostic strength of these metagenes was largely restricted to tumors within the highest proliferation tertile, though intrinsic subtype-specific differences were observed in the intermediate and low proliferation tertiles. In highly proliferative tumors, high tertile immune metagene expression equated with markedly reduced risk of metastasis whereas tumors with low tertile expression of any one of the three immune metagenes were associated with poor outcome despite higher expression of the other two metagenes., These findings suggest that a productive interplay among multiple immune cell types at the tumor site promotes long-term anti-metastatic immunity in a proliferation-dependent manner. The emergence of a subset of effective immune responders among highly proliferative tumors has novel prognostic ramifications.","Breast cancer, gene signatures, hierarchical clustering, immune metagene, intrinsic subtypes, metagene tertiles, multivariable analysis, prognosis, proliferation metagene, survival analysis","Expression profiling studies in human tumors have enabled new insights into the genes and pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis and spurred the development of gene expression signatures prognostic of patient outcomes. Genes comprising prognostic signatures often provide clues to the pathobiological mechanisms that drive cancer progression. With the aim of discovering genes with statistical associations with breast cancer recurrence, we and others have identified a number of genes with roles in cellular proliferation [1–6], including multi-gene proliferation signatures that directly reflect tumor proliferative capacity [1, 4–7]. These signatures are highly significantly associated with poor patient outcomes, consistent with the view that uncontrolled cell proliferation is a central feature of neoplastic disease and, ultimately, a contributing factor in metastatic progression [8, 9]. Indeed, proliferation-associated genes are common components of many previously reported prognostic gene signatures, including Genomic Health's 21-gene Oncotype Dx test [10, 11] (Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA), and frequently account for the majority of the prognostic power driving the performance of these signatures [12–14]. Thus, a clear biological understanding of how prognostic genes relate to different aspects of tumor pathobiology is imperative to both the optimal construction of prognostic models and the elucidation of key regulators of cancer behavior., In recent years, we and others have observed that elevated expression levels of many genes involved in immune response pathways are associated with reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence [15–19]. These observations support the view that cancer-leukocyte interactions in the microenvironment of established tumors may function to limit the growth and metastatic progression of breast cancer [20–22]. However, the extent to which these genes reflect different effector cell populations, or contribute to patient prognosis in the presence of other predictive biomarkers such as proliferation, remains unclear., In this report, we investigate the biological origins of coordinately expressed genes in breast cancer that exhibit statistical associations with patient distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We identify gene clusters indicative of tumor-immune cell interactions that organize into three distinct immunity-related gene signatures, or metagenes, and shed light on their prognostic implications for tumors of differing proliferative capacity with an emphasis on highly proliferative breast cancers and the most aggressive intrinsic molecular subtypes in particular., The immune contexture of human cancer, defined as the abundance, location and functional orientation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells [36, 37], is gaining recognition as a principal determinant of the biological and clinical behavior of many cancer types. Although it is well-established that the immune contexture may elicit both pro- and anti-tumorigenic responses, a growing body of evidence indicates that the presence of abundant tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, within established tumors, foretells favorable prognosis. This association has been rigorously documented for a number of malignancies, most notably cancers of the skin [38, 39], ovary [40, 41], colon [42–45] and breast [20–22], underscoring the broad protective effects of anti-cancer immunosurveillance [46–48]., In this work, we investigated the prognostic relevance of transcriptomic footprints of the immune contexture of breast cancer and identified both immune and biological configurations of breast cancer with distinct prognostic attributes. Historically, immunohistochemical measures of the relative abundance of infiltrating immune cells in breast tumors, viewed as non-specific infiltrate or as specific leukocyte subpopulations (such as CD8+ T cells), have led to some controversy with regard to the role of the immune system in patient prognosis [20, 49–52]. However, prominent immune cell infiltrate observed within late-stage, high-grade, or lymph node-positive breast cancers has consistently been associated with recurrence-free survival of patients [20, 51–54]. More recently, we and others have employed bioinformatic strategies to investigate the biological underpinnings of genes associated with breast cancer outcomes [15–19]. A common finding among these studies was the favorable prognosis associated with high expression of various immune-related gene cassettes representing admixed immune cell populations [15, 19, 55, 56] or B cell-enriched [18, 30, 32, 57] or T cell-enriched [17, 18, 33] cell populations, specifically, among ER- or HER2+ breast cancer patients [15, 17, 19, 30, 32, 33, 55–57]. In the current work, we demonstrate for the first time that a proliferation metagene reflecting tumor proliferative capacity can sharply demarcate breast cancer cases into proliferative subclasses (low, intermediate and high) where the prognostic attributes of immune gene signatures are differentially manifested., We identified three distinct expression vectors, or metagenes, within breast tumors that distinguish different tumor-infiltrating leukocyte populations: the B/P metagene (B cells/plasma cells); the T/NK metagene (T cells/natural killer cells); and the M/D metagene (monocytes/dendritic cells). While analysis at the population level revealed that the prognostic power of each immune metagene was uniformly restricted to tumors comprising the PH tertile, analysis by intrinsic subtypes further defined the prognostic orientation of the immune metagenes. For example, the immune metagenes were not associated with DMFS in CL and LumA subtypes of the PH tertile, although the small number of cases examined (n = 39 and n = 20, respectively) may have been statistically limiting. Conversely, the immune metagenes were significantly prognostic in both the PH and PI tertiles in the ER-, Basal-like and LumB subtypes. An interesting and unexpected finding was the prognostic implications of the immune metagenes in the PL ER-, Basal-like and LumB tumors comprising 13%, 9% and 7% of their respective populations. Not only were the immune metagenes not associated with favorable prognosis in the PL tertile, but statistically significant poor-outcome associations were observed, particularly for the T/NK metagene. That these observations were made in relatively small sample populations (ranging from 26 to 51 cases) necessitates caution when interpreting the results. However, that the poor-outcome association of the T/NK metagene achieved statistical significance in both the ER- and LumB (ER+) subpopulations suggests the possibility of the existence of a low proliferation-associated, ER-independent tumor phenotype where T cell and/or natural killer cell abundance may signify pro-metastatic rather than anti-metastatic behavior. By contrast, in the LumA tumors of the PL tertile (n = 347), all three immune metagenes trended towards associations with favorable DMFS, with the T/NK metagene achieving statistical significance. Together, these observations paint a complex picture of how tumor-immune cell interactions regulate malignant progression and suggest that the pro- or anti-tumorigenic properties of infiltrating immune cells vary not only with the proliferative status of the tumor, but are determined, in part, by factors associated with intrinsic subtype., How tumor proliferation rate relates to pro- or anti-cancer immune cell behavior has, to our knowledge, not been studied; however, it is plausible that proliferation status could act as a surrogate for one or more immunomodulatory pathological contexts. For example, it has been widely observed that, in breast cancer, the rates of proliferation and cell death are positively correlated [58–61]. Apoptosis and necrosis are associated with both enhanced lymphocytic infiltrate in breast cancer [60] and enhanced immunogenic response [62–64]. Thus, cell death that increases available tumor antigen may attract antigen-presenting cells that in turn recruit and/or activate T and B cells in the tumor. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis [65], which supports increased proliferation, may allow better tumor access by immune cells. These possibilities may explain, in part, the high rate of recurrence-free survival observed in the high immune metagene tertiles of highly proliferative breast cancer. Furthermore, a reduced proliferative (and apoptotic) capacity could reflect a tumor microenvironment more conducive to immunosuppression, and subsequently, poorer survival outcomes. In such an instance, for example, CD4+/FOXP3+ T regulatory cells may predominate over CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The abundance and location of tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells, as well as their ratio with cytotoxic T cells, have previously been shown to associate with poor breast cancer outcomes [66–69]., Most previously described immune gene signatures discovered in microarray analyses (including the metagenes described herein) trace back to a common origin for their discovery: a gene cluster of approximately 600 genes highly expressed by tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and whose expression patterns form a larger, diverse immune gene cluster when analyzed in bulk tumor tissues [17]. However, the different gene selection methodologies used, and the variation in size and composition of patient populations examined, may together explain the diversity in gene make-up across the reported signatures, as well as conflicting observations regarding the prognostic performances of similarly derived immune gene cassettes [17]. For example, we and others have observed that not all genes of this larger immune gene cluster are prognostic of breast cancer survival, with some carrying substantially more prognostic weight than others. Although the unsupervised gene selection methods used in previous studies have demonstrated predictive power of the immune genes, the supervised strategy we employed (that is, selecting genes with significant DMFS associations prior to metagene construction) enabled the parsing out of the immune genes with greatest prognostic strength. These genes may point not only to specific cellular components of the immune contexture, but also to immunological functional orientations required for tumor rejection. A more precise assessment of the cellular origins and functional attributes of these genes is needed., Rody and colleagues [17] deconstructed the larger immune gene cluster into seven metagenes that appeared to reflect various components of the immune system. In multivariable analysis, only a T cell-related metagene was found to be significantly correlated with disease-free survival (P = 0.01) when considering a mixed population of 1,263 patients with breast cancer; consequently, this was the metagene carried forward for further analysis in ER and HER2 status-specific populations. By contrast, our multivariable analysis revealed that multiple immune metagenes may contribute additive prognostic information when considered in combination with one another. This is likely due in part to our focus on immune genes with a priori associations with DMFS, as well as the fact that our analysis was confined to the highly proliferative breast tumors as defined by our proliferation metagene, while that of Rody and colleagues was not restricted to the more proliferative cases. Furthermore, the composition of our immune metagenes also varied with those of Rody and colleagues. Although 80% of the probe sets comprising our B/P metagene overlapped with the Rody IgG (B cell) metagene, only 60% of our T/NK probe sets overlapped with the Rody LCK (T cell) metagene, and our M/D metagene comprised of novel probe sets not selected by their methods., Our observation that the prognostic attributes of the immune metagenes are largely non-redundant may reflect the importance of cooperative interplay among different immune cell types in metastasis-protective immunity. Indeed, proteins critical for such interactions are evidenced in the composition of our metagenes. For example, CD27, a component of the T/NK metagene, encodes a type I transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that plays key roles in the expansion and memory of activated CD8+ killer T cells [70, 71] as well as B-cell activation and immunoglobulin synthesis [72, 73]. In natural killer cells, high expression of CD27 is associated with greater effector function and enhanced interaction with dendritic cells compared to CD27-low natural killer cells that exhibit a higher stimulation threshold and express inhibitory receptors [74]. Moreover, the M/D metagene comprises a number of MHC class II (HLA) alpha and beta chain paralogs expressed by professional antigen-presenting cells. The products of these genes present extracellular antigens to T lymphocytes thereby stimulating expansion of T helper cells and, subsequently, the downstream activation of plasma B cells. If such interactions are essential to the maintenance of DMFS, this could explain our observation that patients having even a single low tertile immune metagene assignment are unlikely to achieve a durable remission (Figure 5A)., Tertile-based cut-points were used in our analysis to characterize prognostic interactions in broad terms, not to develop optimized prognostic classifiers. Nevertheless, we observed that the tertiles could be used to identify significant therapy-relevant risk groups. ER+, LN- breast cancer is frequently treated with hormonal therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. In recent years, the decision to withhold chemotherapy from a fraction of these patients has been justified by the 21-gene Oncotype Dx test (Genomic Health, Inc.) which relies on a gene-based classification algorithm. Because proliferation genes carry the greatest prognostic weight in this algorithm [10, 11], it is not surprising that virtually all of the highly proliferative cases are assigned to the high and intermediate risk groups where the use of chemotherapy is indicated. Interestingly, we observed that about 23% of the highly proliferative, ER+, LN- cases possessed high tertiles for all three immune metagenes, and subsequently exhibited excellent 10-year DMFS following tamoxifen monotherapy. This high survival rate of this group (> 90% at 10 years) is similar to the disease-free survival rate of the Oncotype Dx low-risk group [10]. This indicates that the immune metagenes may have value in identifying a second low-risk fraction of patients from among the highly proliferative (high Oncotype Dx recurrence score) cases who might also be spared unnecessary chemotherapy. Furthermore, this same high tertile immune metagene profile identified patients with ER-, Basal-like breast cancer (predominantly triple negative breast cancer) that would have excellent 10-year survival following adjuvant chemotherapy. By contrast, cases associated with one or more low immune metagenes exhibited > 50% probability of distant metastasis before 5 years. Thus, the immune metagenes could aid in the selection of patients most in need of, and most suitable for the testing of, new therapeutic agents being evaluated in clinical trials. It should be noted that these prognostic observations may reflect some bias related to historical treatment standards such as the use of adjuvant CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil), FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) and AC (cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin). In recent years, the addition of taxanes to chemotherapeutic regimens has reduced the rate of breast cancer relapseby 10% to 15%. Thus, the extent to which the immune metagenes would retain prognostic value in light of today's taxane-inclusive regimens warrants prospective evaluation. Furthermore, mounting evidence that anthracyclines and taxanes both possess immunomodulatory activity that impacts treatment efficacy [75–78] provides further rationale for investigating the clinical importance of the immune metagenes in patients treated with chemotherapy. Finally, further work will be necessary to determine the optimal diagnostic platform for immune metagene assessment, as well as the precise metagene thresholds that provide maximal prognostic utility within specific breast tumor subtypes., Gene expression profiles that quantify immune cell abundance within breast tumors are prognostic of DMFS. The prognostic value of these signatures does not manifest in all tumor types, but rather can be stratified by tumor proliferative capacity in a manner that further depends on molecular subtype. Our findings suggest that multiple immune metagenes measured in combination may provide actionable prognostic information for the most aggressive breast cancer phenotypes for which prognostic assays remain lacking. This work sheds new light on the roles of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in safeguarding patients against distant metastasis, and suggests an important and quantifiable interplay between different immune cell populations in establishing long-term, metastasis-protective immunity."

When spacers are expressed, they direct CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to silence complementary invading DNA. In order to characterize the invaders of human microbiomes, we use spacers from CRISPR arrays that we had previously assembled from shotgun metagenomic datasets, and identify contigs that contain these spacers' targets., We discover 95,000 contigs that are putative invasive mobile genetic elements, some targeted by hundreds of CRISPR spacers. We find that oral sites in healthy human populations have a much greater variety of mobile genetic elements than stool samples. Mobile genetic elements carry genes encoding diverse functions: only 7% of the mobile genetic elements are similar to known phages or plasmids, although a much greater proportion contain phage- or plasmid-related genes. A small number of contigs share similarity with known integrative and conjugative elements, providing the first examples of CRISPR defenses against this class of element. We provide detailed analyses of a few large mobile genetic elements of various types, and a relative abundance analysis of mobile genetic elements and putative hosts, exploring the dynamic activities of mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes. A joint analysis of mobile genetic elements and CRISPRs shows that protospacer-adjacent motifs drive their interaction network; however, some CRISPR-Cas systems target mobile genetic elements lacking motifs., We identify a large collection of invasive mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes, an important resource for further study of the interaction between the CRISPR-Cas immune system and invaders.","CRISPR-Cas system, human microbiome, mobile genetic element (MGE)","Bacterial genomes are by no means static - they constantly exchange genetic materials, primarily through the action of various types of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Horizontal transfer of MGEs is a key driving force in bacterial evolution, allowing bacteria to rapidly develop new traits. Many human pathogens acquire strain-specific properties and functions through foreign DNAs delivered by bacteriophages and plasmids - important factors in the spread of antibiotic resistance [1–4]. Another class of MGEs is integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), bacterial MGEs that primarily reside in the host cell's chromosome, yet have the ability to transfer between cells by conjugation. But unlike plasmids, ICEs cannot be maintained in an extrachromosomal state because they cannot replicate autonomously, although this is still under investigation [5]. There are also genomic islands, a more general term for any cluster of genes in bacterial genomes acquired from horizontal transfers; an island can be a 'pathogenicity island' or a 'metabolic island' - among others - according to the functions of its genes [6, 7]., Bacteria have developed various defense systems to limit the exchange of MGEs. Bacterial innate immunity is achieved by adsorption-blocking, methylation-restriction systems, and production of extracellular matrix, among other mechanisms [8], whereas adaptive immunity systems acquire invasive DNAs and use them for interference against further invasion of matching foreign DNA molecules. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins systems are an RNA-guided adaptive immunity system that provides sequence-directed defense against MGEs [8–14]. CRISPR-Cas systems are found in most archaeal and some bacterial genomes [9, 15] (see a list of the genomes at the CRISPRdb website [16]). Recently, a bacterial type II CRISPR-Cas system (which uses cas9) has been engineered to achieve guided genome engineering in human cells [17, 18], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [19] and Zebrafish embryos [20], and to achieve selective repression of gene expression in Escherichia coli (by using a catalytically dead Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity) [21]., In general, CRISPR spacer-repeat arrays consist of 24 to 47 bp direct repeats flanking unique spacers acquired from foreign DNAs that have invaded the host and been stored in CRISPR arrays as a consequence (the donor sequences for spacers in the MGEs are called protospacers). To affect interference, these arrays are transcribed as precursor RNAs, and subsequently truncated to short CRISPR RNAs by Cas proteins encoded next to the CRISPR array, and used to guide subsequent attacks at the protospacers on matching invaders [22, 23]. A consequence of the constant arms race between bacteria and invading DNA sequences (via CRISPR-Cas systems) is the rapid turnover of the spacers in CRISPR arrays. For example, an analysis of the streptococcal CRISPRs from human saliva, in which CRISPR spacers and repeats were amplified from salivary DNA - using the conserved streptococcal CRISPR repeat sequence for priming - revealed substantial spacer sequence diversity within and between subjects over time [24]., Most previous studies of CRISPR-Cas defense systems have focused, not surprisingly, on their interactions with phages [25–28], with fewer studies of other types of MGEs that may be defended against by CRISPR defense systems [10]. Considering that viruses are the most abundant organisms on earth, our understanding of viral diversity, functions and interactions is still very limited, and understanding the interactions between bacterial hosts and viruses is an essential step toward understanding bacterial ecology. As a practical application, the warfare between bacteriophage and host via CRISPR defense systems in dairy fermentation processes has been extensively studied (for example, Streptococcus thermophiles, which utilizes CRISPRs to defend against its active invaders, S. thermophiles bacteriophages [10, 23])., Fewer studies have examined interactions between CRISPR-Cas systems and plasmids. Marraffini and Sontheimer [2] discovered that a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis contains a spacer that is homologous to the nickase gene found in most staphylococcal plasmids, and showed that CRISPR interference prevents conjugation and plasmid transformation in S. epidermidis (at the DNA level), and the interference could be blocked by insertion of a self-splicing intron into nickase at the protospacer site. Palmer and Gilmore identified matches between CRISPR spacers found in 16 Enterococcus faecalis draft genome sequences and sequences from mobile elements, including pheromone-responsive plasmids and phage, and found a highly significant inverse correlation between the presence of a CRISPR locus and acquired antibiotic resistance in E. faecalis, suggesting that antibiotic use inadvertently selects for enterococcal strains with compromised genome defense and an increased ability to acquire drug-resistance-encoding plasmids [4]., Bacteria and phage (and other types of MGEs) co-exist and co-evolve in diverse environments, and a better understanding of the interactive relationship between host and MGEs requires a metagenomic approach. Most metagenomic studies [29–31] focus on only one side of the story: either the bacteria or the MGEs. Sequencing of viral-like particles enriched from fecal samples obtained from healthy adult female monozygotic twins (co-twins) and their mothers revealed high inter-personal diversity even among co-twins and their mothers, whereas temporal intra-personal variation in viromes is very low [32]. Similarly, pyrosequencing of virus-enriched metagenomes isolated from bovine rumen fluid has identified up to 28,000 different viral genotypes, revealing a high viral diversity in the rumen microbiome [30]. Combined analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems and viruses can be more revealing. For example, Pride et al. [33] compared their collection of streptococcal CRISPR sequences (derived by a targeted sequencing approach [24]) with virome reads in the saliva of four human volunters over 17 months, and observed co-existence of spacers and viruses, suggesting that streptococcal CRISPR-Cas systems are under constant pressure from salivary viruses., Andersson and Banfield [29] reconstructed virus and host eubacterial and archaeal genome sequences from community genomic data from two natural acidophilic biofilms, and matched viruses with their hosts using spacers. Although acidophilic biofilms are rather simple microbial communities, this work demonstrated that by extracting both bacterial and viral sequences, and identifying their interactions through CRISPRs, metagenomics can become a powerful tool to reveal fundamental rules governing the microbial world: for example, Andersson and Banfield suggest that community stability is achieved by rapid but compensatory shifts in host resistance levels and virus population structure. A more recent study utilizes spacer-protospacer relationships to discover potential viral contigs in much more complex microbial communities, human gut microbiomes [34], pioneering the use of CRISPR spacers to recover MGE sequences from microbial community sequencing data, and opening up opportunities for studying the arms race between viruses and their bacterial hosts., As a more comprehensive approach to understanding the interactions between bacterial hosts and invading DNAs (not limited to phages) in human microbiomes, we have investigated about 700 human microbiome datasets, collected by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) consortium [35, 36]. This study has allowed us to identify novel MGEs that are involved in CRISPR-Cas systems and characterize their properties. Our discovery of MGEs is leveraged on our previous systematic annotation of CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays by targeted assembly, which first pools reads that contain repeats and then assembles the pooled reads into CRISPR arrays with repeat-spacer units [37]. We analyzed all the non-redundant candidate MGEs targeted by multiple spacers. Analysis of these MGEs demonstrates that the CRISPR-Cas defense systems target not only phage, but also other types of MGEs, including plasmids, genomic islands and ICEs. Notably, we report the first CRISPR-Cas systems targeting ICEs; a previous study [3] showed that a CRISPR system inhibits prophage acquisition in Streptococcus pyogenes, but in spite of the presence of 12 ICEs distributed in 13 sequenced S. pyogenes strains, no spacers were found that were acquired from these ICEs. A joint analysis of the CRISPR arrays and MGEs allows us to study the interaction patterns between the bacterial CRISPR systems and invaders. We observed that protospacer-adjacent motifs (PAMs) drive the resistance network between MGEs and CRISPR systems, with exceptions - some CRISPR systems target MGEs lacking the classical PAM sequences or any other conserved motif., One potential application of CRISPRs is to improve the annotation of bacterial genomes. Many computational approaches have been developed to detect MGEs, using nucleotide composition differences between the MGEs and the host genomes [55] or comparative genomics approaches [56]. A limitation of the composition-based approaches is that nucleotide composition has large variation and it is not always sufficient for detecting alien genes (as shown in the various predictions of the genomic island in the H. parainfluenzae T3T1 genome; see Figure 2), while comparative genomics approaches rely on the availability of genomes. Discovery of MGEs via CRISPR-Cas systems provides an unbiased catalog of MGEs, independent of known homology and sequence composition biases - as evidenced by the extremely diverse collection we provide in this work. The traces of CRISPR-Cas defenses (the spacers) provide complementary information to sequence information (homology and composition), and we expect that a new breed of approaches will combine all this information to improve the annotation of alien regions and therefore of bacterial genomes., Several questions arise from our analysis of MGEs. The first is that majority of the identified MGEs are not identified as phage, plasmids or ICEs, and so their mechanism of mobility is unknown. Second, MGEs carry genes that encode diverse functions, and a majority still have unknown functions. The third challenging problem is to discover possible mechanisms for those CRISPR-Cas systems that seem to not rely on the recognition of PAMs for spacer acquisition. A fourth problem is to identify the bacterial hosts of the MGEs - this task is difficult due to the fast mutation rates of MGEs and the high turnover rate of the spacers in CRISPR arrays. Attempts have been made - including our approach that uses contigs containing regions with protospacers (that is, integrated MGEs) and regions of flanking bacterial genomes (so both players were caught in the same contig), and a method that relies on spacer matching [34]; however, only a small proportion of the MGEs (or viruses) have had their putative bacterial hosts identified., We observed an anti-correlation between the CRISPR-Cas systems and the presence of MGEs (data not shown), but we have also found many samples where MGEs and CRISPRs co-exist (also reported in [33]). We will look further into this phenomenon, and investigate the sequence variations of the MGEs in those samples, aiming to discover the possible mechanisms that MGEs adopt to escape CRISPR defenses (see [57]) in their natural environments., We applied the common approach to detecting PAMs, by aligning the adjacent regions of predicted protospacers and then using Weblogo (see Methods) to detect motifs in the alignment. We checked both upstream and downstream regions of the protospacers, as the direction of the CRISPRs may be difficult to determine for some cases. Considering that this strategy may miss the motifs when the boundaries of the protospacers are not exactly defined, we also applied MEME to de novo detect the motifs in the adjacent regions. We cannot exclude completely the possibility that a PAM was not detected because mutations have occurred in many of the adjacent regions of protospacers, but given the large number of protospacers we could compare, we feel this is unlikely. In the future we will investigate those predicted MGEs that lack PAMs using additional approaches., The same strategy of recovering MGEs using their traces in CRISPR-Cas systems can be applied to metagenomic datasets from other environments (for example, ocean, soil and other animal-associated environments). We foresee that, with a comprehensive resource of both CRISPRs and MGEs, we will be able to investigate the functionality of MGEomes and their impact on the structure and function of microbial communities., We have identified an extremely large collection of MGEs, using evidence of their having invading bacterial genomes and being defended against by CRISPR-Cas defense systems. Analysis of these MGEs demonstrates that the CRISPR defense systems target not only phage but also other types of MGEs, including plasmids, ICEs and genomic islands. A joint analysis of the CRISPR arrays and MGEs allows us to study the interaction patterns between the bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems and invaders. PAMs largely determine the resistance network: the same CRISPR type favors similar PAMs when attacking various MGEs, whereas different CRISPRs attacking the same MGE acquire quite different spacers. However, we observed that some CRISPR types target MGEs lacking classical PAM sequences or any other conserved motif, suggesting that the CRISPR resistance network might be more complex than it appears. We believe that this collection of MGEs will be a valuable resource to studies of the impacts of MGEs on microbial communities [58], and the arms race between bacteria and invasive DNAs (of various kinds)."

Here, we used a phosphoproteomic approach to investigate biological heterogeneity across hematological cancer cell lines including acute myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma., Mass spectrometry was used to quantify 2,000 phosphorylation sites across three acute myeloid leukemia, three lymphoma, and three multiple myeloma cell lines in six biological replicates. The intensities of the phosphorylation sites grouped these cancer cell lines according to their tumor type. In addition, a phosphoproteomic analysis of seven acute myeloid leukemia cell lines revealed a battery of phosphorylation sites whose combined intensities correlated with the growth-inhibitory responses to three kinase inhibitors with remarkable correlation coefficients and fold changes (> 100 between the most resistant and sensitive cells). Modeling based on regression analysis indicated that a subset of phosphorylation sites could be used to predict response to the tested drugs. Quantitative analysis of phosphorylation motifs indicated that resistant and sensitive cells differed in their patterns of kinase activities, but, interestingly, phosphorylations correlating with responses were not on members of the pathway being targeted; instead, these mainly were on parallel kinase pathways., This study reveals that the information on kinase activation encoded in phosphoproteomics data correlates remarkably well with the phenotypic responses of cancer cells to compounds that target kinase signaling and could be useful for the identification of novel markers of resistance or sensitivity to drugs that target the signaling network.","","Hematologic malignancies are a group of neoplastic diseases that originate from the transformation of bone marrow-derived cells. This group, which includes leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas, is extraordinarily heterogeneous, which reflects the complexity of normal hematopoiesis and the immune system [1]. Although gene expression signatures can be used to classify malignancies into subgroups [2–4], a system-level understanding of the biochemical pathways (both signaling and metabolic) responsible for tumor phenotypes requires knowledge of signaling pathway activity, information that cannot be provided by measuring mRNA or protein expression alone [5, 6], as enzyme expression does not necessarily correlate with pathway activity [7]., Essentially all cancers are driven by deregulation of protein kinase cascades downstream of growth factor, antigen, and G protein-coupled receptors [8]. Consequently, several kinase inhibitors that block cell transduction pathways overactive in cancer are already in the clinic while others are undergoing pre-clinical or clinical development. However, although clinical impact is observed in some patients, many patients do not respond to these therapies or subsequently develop resistance [9, 10]. The use of predictive biomarkers, or 'companion diagnostics', is therefore important in individualizing such targeted agents [11]. While the activity of the target kinase can in some instances predict response [12], this is not always the case, as the activity of parallel pathways in the network can contribute to resistance [13, 14]. It could therefore be envisaged that the analysis of kinase signaling without a preconception of the pathways that may be active could be advantageous in predicting responses to kinase inhibitors., Phosphorylation is a posttranslational modification regulated by the activity of kinases and phosphatases. By definition, each phosphorylation site is the result of a kinase/phosphatase reaction pair. Changes in phosphorylation status can alter many aspects of protein biology, including their localization, protein-protein interactions, stability, and enzymatic activity [15]. Although the information coded by phosphorylation patterns has not been completely deciphered, many phosphorylation sites can be associated with the activity of a specific protein kinase and thereby classified into signaling pathways [16–18]. Thus, global analysis of protein phosphorylation using quantitative techniques may in principle be translated into knowledge of the activation status of signaling pathways. This information, in turn, could be used to rationalize how the wiring of the kinase network contributes to the phenotypic characteristics of different tumors, such as aggressiveness, metastatic potential, and sensitivity to therapy., The application of new proteomic techniques for phosphopeptide quantification is contributing to an improved understanding of cancer cell biology [19–23]. Several techniques for quantitative proteomics have been developed; these can be divided into those that require labeling of proteins with stable isotopes (for example, SILAC and iTRAQ) and those that do not require labeling [24, 25]. Approaches based on labeling techniques usually detect a larger number of phosphopeptides than those based on label-free approachesbecause labeling techniques are compatible with extensive fractionation prior to mass spectrometry analysis. However, because of the time-consuming nature of such analyses, studies based on labeling techniques normally compare a small number of samples with no (or very few) biological replicates, a feature that limit the statistical significance of the results. Therefore there is a trade-off between the number of peptide/proteins identified and samples that can be compared in a study. Label-free approaches are preferred when the aim is to compare large sample numbers and replicates [26, 27] even though the penetrance of the approach may not be as large as when using techniques that allow extensive fractionation before mass spectrometry analysis., In the current study, label-free mass spectrometry (MS) was first used to analyze the phosphoproteomes of nine different hematological cancer cell lines. Unsupervised analysis of the data based on principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering classified these cell lines according to their pathological origin, namely acute myeloid leukemia (AML), lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Through a lasso linear regression analysis we assessed the potential of this data in predicting the level of sensitivity of seven AML to three kinase inhibitors: PI-103 (a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor), MEK-i, and JAK-i. Finally we identified phosphopeptides whose intensities across the cell lines correlated with the sensitivity to three inhibitors. Our results revealed a battery of phosphorylation sites whose intensities strongly correlated with responses of our AML panel to the compounds (with R > 0.9 and > 100-fold difference between most sensitive and most resistant cell line). These data therefore indicate that MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomics has the potential to classify cell lines into distinct subgroups according to their pathological origin and to their sensitivity to drugs that target kinase signaling. Phosphorylation sites that correlated with resistance were enriched in basic and proline-directed motifs, whereas those that correlated with sensitivity were mainly acidic or hydrophobic containing, thus suggesting that the relative activities of basophilic, proline directed, and acidophilic kinases may determine responses to the inhibitors. Therefore, the results of our study indicate that unbiased profiling of phosphorylation has the potential to stratify AML cells based on their responses to signaling inhibitors because these responses may be dependent on the combination of pathways (both target and parallel) active in cells, rather than on the activity of the target kinase/pathway only., Tumor classification informs therapeutic strategies and provides information on prognosis [42]. A classification based on the likely response to a particular therapy may be of particular importance in the use of agents that target protein and lipid kinases in signaling pathways [43]. These enzymes are drug targets deregulated in essentially all cancers [8] but the lack of robust and generally applicable methods to stratify patients for therapies based on kinase inhibitors limit their clinical applicability [11]. DNA sequencing, expression arrays and proteomic signatures have been used both to classify tumors and to indicate the presence of mutation status or expression of genes involved in cancer cell signaling [44–46]. However, protein, gene, or mRNA studies do not necessarily reflect enzyme activity, which ultimately determines the activation status of signaling pathways involved in cancer cell biology [5, 6, 47, 48]. Protein phosphorylation is the result of the activities of kinases present in the pathways that are being targeted by signaling inhibitors and kinase activity is a major determinant in conferring resistance/sensitivity to these compounds. Therefore, it may be argued that a comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation might represent an ideal readout to classify tumors based on the likelihood of response to inhibitors that target signaling pathways., In order to investigate whether phosphoproteomics may be used to classify hematological cancers based on their phenotype, and to provide proof-of-principle of the approach, we analyzed the most abundant phosphoproteomes of nine hematological cancer cell lines. Qualitative analysis of the data based on Gene Ontologies revealed that our analysis was broad and included phosphopeptides from all types of proteins, including those in cell membranes, cytosol, and subcellular compartments. While membrane proteins were slightly less represented than expected, proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and translation, and protein kinases were particularly well represented in our phosphoprotein dataset., As for the quantitative analyses, our data showed that cancer cells of different phenotypes and origin had markedly different patterns of phosphorylation, thus indicating that phosphorylation could be used to classify these cells according to phenotype. PCA and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis classified cell lines according to their pathology (AML, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma), thus indicating that the phosphoproteomes of cells of the same pathology are more similar than those derived from different diseases. Furthermore, PC1 in the PCA and unsupervised hierarchical clustering clearly separated AML cells that have a myeloid lineage from the other two diseases that have a lymphoid lineage., We evaluated the potential ability of phosphoproteomics data in predicting drug response through a robust cross-validation framework based on Lasso regression analysis, showing that the phosphorylation levels of a relatively small subset of phosphopeptides was informative with regard to treatment outcomes (Figure 3). In addition, using a complementary approach based on a correlation study, we identified phosphopeptide sets whose combined intensities correlated with the responses to the three compounds with remarkable correlation coefficients (R = 0.99, 0.95, and 0.94 for the responses to PI-103, MEK-i, and JAK-i, respectively). In addition to observing strong correlations with cell viability, we also found that the magnitude of changes between the phosphopeptide signatures of the most resistant and most sensitive cells were greater, or close, to 100-fold in each case (Figures 4F, 5D, and 6D). These large differences in phosphopeptide intensities are noteworthy and important as ideal predictors of response need to show robust differences and steep slopes in the regression function in addition to having a good correlation. Therefore, our proof-of-concept study indicates that phosphoproteomics may represent a general tool to identify biomarkers of response to kinase inhibitors and to classify cancers based on their likelihood that these respond to targeted therapies. Although some peptides that predicted responses to kinase inhibitors in AML were also associated with responses to the same inhibitors in lymphoma and multiple myeloma cells, there were subsets of phosphopeptides that predicted responses in AML cells only. This could be attributed to the marked differences in the patterns of basal phosphorylation between lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and AML cells (Figure 1) which may be a reflection of differences in the activity of kinase signaling across these diseases., The correlation between PI3K pathway activity markers and sensitivity to PI3K compounds has been found to be weak in recent studies [49, 50]. For example, no correlation between activating mutations on PIK3CA (the gene coding for the PI3K catalytic alpha isoform) with responses to PI3K inhibitors were found in cell lines [49], while a recently reported clinical trial found that just 30% of breast and gynecologic patients harboring PIK3CA mutations responded to PI3K therapies [50]. Dan et al. found a weak correlation between responses to PI3K inhibitors and phosphorylation of Akt (R < 0.45 and fold < 10 [49]), which is a marker of PI3K activity. Although the primary aim of this work was not to identify mechanisms of resistance, it was interesting to observe that, consistent with the data in Dan et al. [49] and Alcolea et al. [28], the levels of PI3K pathway activity markers did not correlate with the responses of cancer cells to the PI3K inhibitor (Figure 7A). Similarly, phosphorylation of STAT5A, a marker of JAK activity, did not correlate with the responses to JAK-i (Figure 7C). Interestingly, the phosphorylation sites that correlated with resistance were on pathways parallel to those being targeted; that is, on sites phosphorylated by PKC for the PI3K inhibitor (Figure 7B), thus raising the hypothesis that pathways parallel to those being targeted were contributing to resistance. The finding that in PKC and PI3K inhibitors had additive effects in decreasing the viability resistant AML cells (Additional file 10, Figure S6) is consistent with this possibility., Our data therefore suggest that the activity of pathways parallel to those being targeted by the specific inhibitors might contribute to intrinsic resistance to kinase inhibitors, as observed in cells that acquired resistance as a result to chronic exposure to compounds that target signaling nodes [13, 14, 28, 51, 52]., Our analysis identified phosphorylation motifs that on the whole correlated with resistance or sensitivity to kinase inhibitors (Figure 8) indicating that different kinases may be activated in resistant and sensitive cells. Thus, it may be proposed that, in this study, unbiased profiling of phosphorylation stratified AML cells based on their responses to signaling inhibitors (Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) because these responses may be dependent on a combination of active pathways (both target and parallel) in cells, rather than on the activity of the target kinase/pathway only. Therefore, the ability to quantitatively analyze protein phosphorylation without a preconception of the pathways that may be implicated in conferring sensitivity may represent an important advance for therapies that target kinase signaling."

We present a novel probabilistic method, EMu, to infer the mutational signatures of these processes from a collection of sequenced tumors. EMu naturally incorporates the tumor-specific opportunity for different mutation types according to sequence composition. Applying EMu to breast cancer data, we derive detailed maps of the activity of each process, both genome-wide and within specific local regions of the genome. Our work provides new opportunities to study the mutational processes underlying cancer development. EMu is available at http://​www.​sanger.​ac.​uk/​resources/​software/​emu/​., The development and progression of cancer is now widely viewed as an evolutionary process [1–3]. Mutation is a key component of this process: cancer development occurring through the progressive acquisition of driver mutations [4]. Cancer genomes often display large numbers of mutations when sequenced; indeed, whole-genome sequencing studies have identified tens of thousands of mutations within individual tumors [5]. The vast majority of these mutations are believed to be passenger mutations not conferring a growth advantage to the cancer cell [4]. They do, however, carry useful information about the forces to which the cancer genome has been subjected during its evolution., A variety of physical, chemical and biological processes are known to lead to mutations in cancer. Sequencing of different cancer types has shown strong and distinct biases for particular mutation types in particular cancers, such as a propensity, due to UV radiation [6], for C:G > T:A mutations in melanoma [7], and an increased number of C:G > A:T mutations resulting from chemicals in tobacco smoke [8, 9]. Deactivation of mismatch repair mechanisms can also lead to mutational biases [10]. We here consider the task of identifying mutational processes at work during cancer development. We assume that these processes are distinct, in that each process leaves a different characteristic mark on the cancer genome. Given sequence data from multiple tumors, in which mutational processes have been active to different extents, we aim to infer the number of elementary mutational processes, their signatures and the contribution of each process towards the spectrum of mutations observed in each tumor. The task itself is an important one: identifying mutational processes is a step towards understanding the causative mechanisms of cancer. A detailed account of the mutational processes active in a cancer could inform a neutral null model of mutations when inferring signals of selection in cancer genomes. The presence of a mutational process could indicate a driver mutation, for example in a gene controlling DNA repair., Computational methods addressing this task have been developed [11, 12] and, more recently, applied to whole genome sequencing data from multiple breast cancer samples [13]. However, as previously implemented, these methods have significant limitations. Firstly, the opportunity for mutations to occur in a given genetic sequence has not been explicitly accounted for. This is important as the observed outcome of a mutational process depends on the composition of the sequence upon which it acts. For example, a process which produces C > T transitions at CpG sites may act with uniform activity across a genome, but it will be realized and observed more often in regions with a higher density of these dinucleotides. Secondly, while considering mutational processes genome-wide, previous studies have not examined the action of different processes within smaller regions of the genome. Unevenness in mutation rate across a cancer genome has been observed, associated with bias in the action of DNA repair mechanisms [5] and with the distribution of histone modification marks [14], suggesting that mutational processes may act differently in different regions of the genome. Changes in mutational opportunity, noted above, are likely to be particularly important within small regions of the genome. Copy number variation, which can be prevalent in cancer [15], substantially alters the mutational opportunity in regions of ploidy change, while different regions of the human genome may radically differ in their internal sequence composition [16]. Finally, previous methods have not explicitly considered the stochastic manner in which mutations are introduced into the genome. Stochasticity, together with the discrete nature of mutation, leads to specific patterns of noise in the observed mutation spectra. This noise is amplified when smaller subsets of the genome are analyzed, making an explicit probabilistic treatment of the data indispensable., We here describe a novel method, EMu, based upon the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [17], to infer the number of elementary mutational processes and their spectra from cancer sequence data. Use of an explicitly probabilistic framework allows our method to account for biases in the mutational opportunity and to accommodate noisy data. Using simulation results, we show that incorporating the mutational opportunity is critical in identifying the correct number of mutational processes within this model. As a likelihood-based method, the EM approach deals naturally with the stochastic nature of mutational processes, and enables us to use model selection criteria, such as the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) [18], to decide which number of processes has the strongest statistical support. Meaningful error estimates of the inferred mutational signatures can be derived either analytically or numerically with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. By extending the rationale of the parameter-learning algorithm to smaller subsets of a cancer genome, the local activity of different processes can be measured. Further, our method is computationally efficient, allowing for the rapid analysis of thousands of cancer samples., We apply our method to the sequences of 21 breast cancers, described in an earlier study [19], and compare the inferred mutational spectra to those previously reported. Next, we examine local variation in the impact of the different mutational processes; we show that regions of kataegis, a phenomenon of regional hypermutation identified in breast cancer [13], are dominated by one specific mutational process. Finally, we take advantage of annotation data from the ENCODE project [20] to study variation in mutational processes associated with chromatin state. The ENCODE project provides segmentations of the human genome in different functional chromatin states [21], mainly based on the distribution of histone modification marks. In cancer, a recent study has identified strong correlations of somatic mutations with some of these histone modifications, notably H3K9me3 [14]. We here present statistical evidence that mutational processes act differently in regions of differing chromatin state in breast cancer. In particular, one of the mutational processes, producing mostly C > T mutations at CpG sites, is strongly underrepresented in promoter regions and enhanced in heterochromatin regions. This suggests that this process is correlated with DNA methylation, as would be the case for spontaneous deamination [22]., The main import of this study is the demonstration of a robust and flexible probabilistic method to extract the elementary mutational processes and their signatures from large-scale cancer mutation data and to localize process activity within the cancer genomes. As an application of the EM paradigm, this method is solidly grounded in information theory and thus allows for a robust separation of the signal from the noise in the data. Using extensive simulated data sets, we have shown that it is highly scalable and can be conveniently used to analyze hundreds to thousands of cancer genomes., In the second part of this study, we have demonstrated how one can infer where the different mutational processes are localized within individual genomes. With respect to breast cancer, we have made some unexpected observations: first, process B is most prevalent in the mutator-phenotype tumor PD4120a, but is also strongly associated with the phenomenon of kataegis, that is, mutational thunderstorms. Second, comparing the process-specific distribution of mutations in the genome to its chromatin state, process C seems to be strongly suppressed in promoter regions and significantly enhanced in heterochromatin regions. The chromatin state annotation that was used here was derived from experiments performed upon healthy tissue. An interesting extension of this work would be to study the correlation between the mutational processes and the functional and epigenetic annotation of the actual cancer genomes that they were found in. This kind of data is as yet unavailable but certainly within reach of current technologies., The inference method presented in this study is not limited to the 96 trinucleotide mutation channels. Additionally, one could include such information as the strandedness of mutations or whether a mutation was an early or late event in the life history of the cancer [19]. This could, potentially, shed light on the temporal sequence with which different mutational processes assault the cancer genome. For all such extensions it has to be ensured that the mutational opportunity is taken into account appropriately. Due to chromosomal rearrangements and large-scale copy number changes during somatic evolution, this mutational opportunity is actually a dynamic quantity [19]. As an approximation, we used the copy number state of the cancer genomes at the time of sequencing to calculate mutational opportunity. For example, a duplication event on one parental copy of a chromosome might have happened in the late stage of a cancer's evolution. The mutational opportunity for this duplicated segment would thus be increased by 50% (from two to three copies) for the remaining time until sequencing. In this work, we have assumed that this increased mutational opportunity was available to all the mutational processes throughout. With more detailed information about the relative timing of copy number changes one could potentially construct an improved effective mutational opportunity., The inference method that we propose is easily generalized to mutation data found in subsets of the cancer genome, for example from exome sequencing studies, as long as the correct mutational opportunity is used. In its present form, the inference of mutational signatures does not explicitly account for any effects of selection on the outcome; we implicitly assume that all mutations are in effect neutral with respect to cancer evolution. However, the signatures we infer here might be of help in a future search for signals of selection in cancer genomes. Any claim for the presence of selection in a sequence must be contrasted against the predictions of a null model of neutral mutations, of which the present mutational signatures could form the basis. To further emphasize the importance of understanding quantitatively the mutational processes active in cancer, we note that passenger mutations themselves have been recently proposed as a potential therapeutic target [24]., Potential future applications of this method include the cataloguing of mutational signatures across different cancer types, identifying shared and cancer-type-specific mutational processes (and, hence, a better classification of cancers by their process composition) and finally, a more refined, cancer-type-dependent null model to identify causal cancer driver variants via signals of selection., We here present a probabilistic model for cancer mutations and a robust method to identify the mutational signatures of processes that were active in sequenced cancers. Under explicit consideration of the opportunity for different mutations to occur, we infer the localization of the mutational processes in individual cancer genomes. Using recent data on breast cancer tumors, we have demonstrated how a comparison of the distribution of mutational processes with functional annotation of the genome can lead to new insights into tumor biology., The current version of EMu is provided as Additional file 2. The most up-to-date version of EMu is available at [28] together with the localization results (see Figure 3) for all 21 cancers in computable document format (cdf) (viewable with Wolfram's free CDF Player [29])."

In this paper, we describe TopHat2, which incorporates many significant enhancements to TopHat. TopHat2 can align reads of various lengths produced by the latest sequencing technologies, while allowing for variable-length indels with respect to the reference genome. In addition to de novo spliced alignment, TopHat2 can align reads across fusion breaks, which can occur after genomic translocations. TopHat2 combines the ability to identify novel splice sites with direct mapping to known transcripts, producing sensitive and accurate alignments, even for highly repetitive genomes or in the presence of pseudogenes. TopHat2 is available at http://​ccb.​jhu.​edu/​software/​tophat., RNA-sequencing technologies [1], which sequence the RNA molecules being transcribed in cells, allow exploration of the process of transcription in exquisite detail. One of the primary goals of RNA-sequencing analysis software is to reconstruct the full set of transcripts (isoforms) of genes that were present in the original cells. In addition to the transcript structures, experimenters need to estimate the expression levels for all transcripts. The first step in the analysis process is to map the RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) reads against the reference genome, which provides the location from which the reads originated. In contrast to DNA-sequence alignment, RNA-seq mapping algorithms have two additional challenges. First, because genes in eukaryotic genomes contain introns, and because reads sequenced from mature mRNA transcripts do not include these introns, any RNA-seq alignment program must be able to handle gapped (or spliced) alignment with very large gaps. In mammalian genomes, introns span a very wide range of lengths, typically from 50 to 100,000 bases, which the alignment algorithm must accommodate. Second, the presence of processed pseudogenes, from which some or all introns have been removed, may cause many exon-spanning reads to map incorrectly. This is particularly acute for the human genome, which contains over 14,000 pseudogenes [2]., In the most recent Ensembl GRCh37 gene annotations, the average length of a mature mRNA transcript in the human genome is 2,227 bp long, and the average exon length is 235 bp. The average number of exons per transcript is 9.5. Assuming that sequencing reads are uniformly distributed along a transcript [3], we would expect 33 to 38% of 100 bp reads from an RNA-seq experiment to span two or more exons. Note that this proportion increases significantly as read length increases from 50 to 150 bp (see Additional file 1 for more details)., More important for the alignment problem is that around 20% of junction-spanning reads extend by 10 bp or less into one of the exons they span. These small 'anchors' make it extremely difficult for alignment software to map reads accurately, particularly if the algorithm relies (as most do) on an initial mapping of fixed-length k-mers to the genome. This initial mapping, using exact matches of k-mers, is crucial for narrowing down the search space into small local regions in which a read is likely to align. If a read extends only a few bases into one of two adjacent exons, then it often happens that the read will align equally well, but incorrectly, with the sequence of the intervening intron. For example, as illustrated in Figure 1, suppose that read r spans exons e
                1
                 and e
                2
                , extending only four bases into e
                2
                . Suppose also that that e
                2
                 begins with GTXX, and the intervening intron also begins with GTXX, where X stands for any of A, G, C, and T. Then r might align perfectly to e
                1
                 and the first four bases of the intron, and the alignment algorithm will fail to find the spliced alignment of r.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Two possible incorrect alignments of spliced reads. 1) A read extending a few bases into the flanking exon can be aligned to the intron instead of the exon. 2) A read spanning multiple exons from genes with processed pseudogene copies can be aligned to the pseudogene copies instead of the gene from which it originates.
                    , In order to handle this problem, the software TopHat2 uses a two-step procedure. First, similar to TopHat1 [4], it detects potential splice sites for introns (detailed further in Methods). It uses these candidate splice sites in a subsequent step to correctly align multiexon-spanning reads. Some RNA-seq aligners, including GSNAP [5], RUM [6], and STAR [7], map reads independently of the alignments of other reads, which may explain their lower sensitivity for these spliced reads (see Results and discussion). MapSplice [8] uses a two-step approach similar to TopHat2., RNA-seq read alignment is further complicated by the presence of processed pseudogenes in the reference genome. Pseudogenes often have highly similar sequences to functional, intron-containing genes. In most cases, the pseudogene versions are not transcribed [9], although this suggestion has recently been disputed [10]. The crucial problem for alignment is that reads spanning multiple exons can be mapped perfectly or near-perfectly to the pseudogene version of a functional gene. For example, suppose a read r spans two exons of a given gene. If the aligner tries to align the read globally (end to end), then it will find an alignment to the pseudogene copy (Figure 1). If the spliced alignment phase, which usually occurs later, does not attempt to realign r, then the pseudogene copy will 'absorb' all reads spanning the splice sites for that gene. TopHat2 can feed r into the spliced alignment phase even when r has been aligned end to end, allowing it to circumvent this problem (see Methods and Results and discussion sections)., We also note that, in our analysis of RNA-seq reads from multiple human samples [11, 12], genes with processed pseudogenes seem to be expressed at higher levels compared with other genes (see Results and discussion). Although this observation has not been explored thoroughly, a plausible explanation is that genes with higher levels of expression may, over the course of evolution, have had an increased chance of being picked up by transposons and re-integrated into the genome, creating pseudogene copies., Concerning the human genome, for which there are relatively comprehensive annotations of protein-coding genes, the annotations can be used to map reads more accurately by aligning the reads preferentially to real genes rather than pseudogenes. GSNAP [5] and STAR [7] also make use of annotation, although they use it in a more limited fashion in order to detect splice sites. TopHat2 can use the full-length transcripts defined by annotations during its initial mapping phase, which produces significant gains in sensitivity and accuracy (see Results and discussion)., Transcripts from a target genome may differ substantially from the reference genome, possibly containing insertions, deletions, and other structural variations [13, 14]. For such regions, previous spliced alignment programs (including the original TopHat) sometimes fail to find a proper alignment. In TopHat2, we implemented new procedures to ensure that reads are aligned with true insertions and deletions (indels). Indels due to sequencing errors will be discovered by Bowtie2 [15], the underlying mapping engine of TopHat2, which can detect short indels very efficiently. In addition, very large deletions, inversions on the same chromosome, and translocations involving different chromosomes are detected by the TopHat-Fusion algorithms [16], which are now incorporated into TopHat2 and available by a simple command-line switch., TopHat2 also includes new algorithms to handle more diverse types of sequencing data. This includes the ability to handle reads generated by ABI SOLiD technology (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using its 'color space' representation. To accomplish this, TopHat2 uses a reference genome translated entirely into color space in order to take advantage of the error-correction capability of that format. TopHat2 also handles datasets in which the reads have variable lengths, allowing the experimenter to merge datasets from multiple sequencing runs with different lengths., TopHat2 can use either Bowtie [17] or Bowtie2 [15] as its core read-alignment engine. TopHat2 has its own indel-finding algorithm, which enhances indel-finding ability of Bowtie2 in the context of spliced alignments. In order to evaluate TopHat2 and compare it with other methods, we ran multiple computational experiments using both real and simulated RNA-seq data., For the simulations, we created multiple sets of 40,000,000 paired-end reads, 100 bp in length, from the entire human genome (release GRCh37). Instead of trying to precisely mimic real RNA-seq experiments, which may not be possible in any practical sense, we generated data with relatively simple settings and expression levels, calculated using a model from the Flux Simulator system [18], as follows. For the first test set, we generated reads from the known transcripts on the entire human genome without introducing any mismatches or indels. We then generated additional datasets, in which we included 1) insertions and deletions into the known transcripts at random locations, and 2) insertions and deletions in the reads themselves to mimic sequencing errors (see Additional file 1). Each of these experimental errors was introduced to test different capabilities of TopHat2 and other RNA-seq aligners. Following the simulations, we evaluated the programs using a recent, real RNA-seq dataset., Discovery of new genes and transcripts is a major objective in many RNA-seq experiments. Deep RNA-seq experiments continue to uncover previously unseen elements of the transcriptome, even in well-studied organisms. Mapping reads to the genome is a core step in such screens, and the accuracy of mapping software can determine the accuracy of downstream steps such as gene and transcript discovery or expression quantification., We have described TopHat2, which provides major accuracy improvements over previous versions and over other RNA-seq mapping tools. Because TopHat2 is built around Bowtie2, it can now align reads across small indels with high accuracy, a feature crucial for studies assessing the effects of genetic mutations on gene and transcript expression. TopHat2 is engineered to work well with a wide range of RNA-seq experimental designs, and it is optimized for the widely available long paired-end reads. These reads pose new challenges because they can span multiple splice sites rather than just one or two; we estimate that nearly half of reads 150 bp long will span two or more human exons. The algorithmic improvements in TopHat2 address this challenge, maintaining both accuracy and speed. Other refinements to the algorithm increase accuracy for reads that span a junction with only a small (≤ 10 bp) overhang, reducing errors in downstream transcript assembly using tools such as Cufflinks. TopHat2 also makes powerful use of available gene annotations, which allow it to avoid erroneously mapping reads to pseudogenes, and generally improve its overall alignment accuracy. Annotation also allows TopHat2 to better align reads that cover microexons, non-canonical splice sites, and other 'unusual' features of eukaryotic transcriptomes., We have shown that TopHat2 performs well over a wide range of read lengths, making it a good fit for most RNA-seq experimental designs. This scalability suggests that as read lengths grow, TopHat2 will continue to report accurate, sensitive alignment results and allow for robust downstream analysis. We believe that TopHat2 reports more accurate alignments than competing tools, using fewer computational resources. RNA-seq experiments are becoming increasingly common and are now routinely used by many biologists. We expect that TopHat2 will provide these scientists with accurate results for use with expression analysis, gene discovery, and many other applications., Given RNA-seq reads as input, TopHat2 begins by mapping reads against the known transcriptome, if an annotation file is provided. This transcriptome mapping improves the overall sensitivity and accuracy of the mapping. It also gives the whole pipeline a significant speed increase, owing to the much smaller size of the transcriptome compared with that of the genome (see Figure 6).
                    Figure 6
                      
                        TopHat2 pipeline. Details are given in the main text.
                    , After the transcriptome-mapping step, some reads remain unmapped because they are derived from unknown transcripts not present in the annotation, or because they contain many miscalled bases. In addition, there may be poorly aligned reads that have been mapped to the wrong location. TopHat2 aligns these unmapped or potentially misaligned reads against the genome (Figure 6, step 2). Any reads contained entirely within exons will be mapped, whereas other spanning introns may not be., Using unmapped reads from step 2, TopHat2 tries to find novel splice sites that are based on known junction signals (GT-AG, GC-AG, and AT-AC). TopHat2 also provides an option to allow users to remap some of the mapped reads, depending on the edit distance values of these reads; that is, those reads whose edit distance is greater than or equal to a user-provided threshold will be treated as unmapped reads. To accomplish this, the unmapped reads (and previously mapped reads with low alignment scores) are split into smaller non-overlapping segments (25 bp each by default) which are then aligned against the genome (Figure 6, step 3). Tophat2 examines any cases in which the left and right segments of the same read are mapped within a user-defined maximum intron size (usually between 50 and 100,000 bp). When this pattern is detected, TopHat2 re-aligns the entire read sequence to that genomic region in order to identify the most likely locations of the splice sites (Figure 6). Using a similar approach, indels and fusion breakpoints are also detected in this step., The genomic sequences flanking these splice sites are concatenated, and the resulting spliced sequences are collected as a set of potential transcript fragments. Any reads not mapped in the previous stages (or mapped very poorly) are then re-aligned with Bowtie2 [15] against this novel transcriptome., After these steps, some of the reads may have been aligned incorrectly by extending an exonic alignment a few bases into the adjacent intron (Figure 1; Figure 6, steps 3 to 5). TopHat2 checks if such alignments extend into the introns identified in the split-alignment phase; if so, it can realign these reads to the adjacent exons instead., In the final stage, TopHat2 divides the reads into those with unique alignments and those with multiple alignments. For the multi-mapped reads, TopHat2 gathers statistical information (for example, the number of supporting reads) about the relevant splice junctions, insertions, and deletions, which it uses to recalculate the alignment score for each read. Based on these new alignment scores, TopHat2 reports the most likely alignment locations for such multi-mapped reads., For paired-end reads, TopHat2 processes the two reads separately through the same mapping stages described above. In the final stage, the independently aligned reads are analyzed together to produce paired alignments, taking into consideration additional factors including fragment length and orientation., For the experiments described in this study, the program version numbers were: TopHat2 2.0.8, TopHat1 1.1.4, GSNAP 2013-01-23, RUM 1.12_01, MapSplice 1.15.2, and STAR 2.3.0e.

Sixty years later, Raymond Gosling shares his memories of the race to the double helix., Something curious happened in scientific research in the mid-20th Century. Biology had been the neglected sibling of chemistry and, especially, physics, which had until then monopolized the glitz and glamor of scientific inquiry. Perhaps it was the sense that many of the big questions in physics had now been tackled, or a philosophical shift brought about by the experience of the dark forces of war and fascism in the 1930s and 40s, or perhaps it was just a simple matter of improved methodology; whatever the cause, history shows that many physicists and chemists began to become excited by biology at this time, and to turn their attention to addressing biological questions. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger is often credited with kick-starting this trend in his book 'What is life?' [7], which is said to have inspired even Crick and Watson themselves in their quest for the double helix., So was Prof (Emeritus) Raymond Gosling DSc FKC (Figure 1) similarly inspired when he opted to pursue a PhD in biophysics, in work that would culminate in establishing the molecular structure of DNA? Not a bit of it! Not only was Gosling unaware of Schrödinger's work until ""much later"", he had not in fact originally wanted to become a scientist at all: ""I wanted to do Medicine, but Father said we couldn't afford Medicine because it would take x years to qualify and so on. And so the next best thing to doing medicine I thought was to do a fundamental subject like physics. I was very attracted by the thought that the Scots always refer to physics as 'natural philosophy'.""

                    , And so a career in physics beckoned. But, having graduated from University College London in 1949, Gosling found himself limited in his options. Edward Andrade was the head of the Physics Department, and if Gosling had stayed on at University College, he would have been bound by Andrade's interests in viscosity and this ""didn't appeal."" Instead, he was tempted by developments across town at King's College, rivals-in-chief to his own alma mater (Box 1), where John Randall (Box 2) had recently taken the Wheatstone Chair of Physics. Instead of being deterred by the rivalry, Gosling impishly thought to himself that it would be ""rather fun"" to join Randall's laboratory., If there's one message that Raymond Gosling would like you to take away from this article, it is that the role of John Randall in the pursuit of the double helix cannot be overstated, and that Randall has lamentably not been adequately credited in most tellings of the story. Gosling feels so strongly on this subject that he recently wrote to The Times to emphasize the point, prompted by an article that had recognized Rosalind Franklin's contribution but that had omitted Randall's., Randall's motto at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Biophysics Unit that he headed at King's College was 'to bring the logi of physics to the graphi of biology'. This interdisciplinary philosophy was at the time decidedly modern, and his switch from the questions of physics to those of biology was also, according to Gosling, ""ahead of the curve"". Randall's modernity extended to his respect for female scientists, many of whom he recruited at King's, as exemplified by his long-standing working relationship with Honor Bell. This facet of Randall's modern outlook was to prove very important with his later recruitment of Rosalind Franklin (Box 2)., ""The people in the University and a few other establishments tended to make fun of Randall's approach, his claim that you would need to have different disciplines working together, and they called it 'Randall's Circus'. Now, that's what attracted me in the first place! I heard about this strange bald-headed little man with a Napoleonic complex who was running the circus in biophysics, and it sounded wonderful to me!"", So was it the rebellion that Gosling was attracted to? ""Yeah, absolutely!"", Randall's most important legacy was his firm belief that DNA must be the agent of genetic inheritance, a concept not widely recognized at the time (despite good evidence to support it [8]), and his consequent determination to discover the structure of what he considered to be the genetic material. This was Randall's circus, and he was the ringmaster - and the ringmaster masterfully guided his troupe in its quest., After spending a year simultaneously studying zoology at Birkbeck and working as a medical physicist at Middlesex Hospital, prompted by Randall's insistence that he first learn some biology, Gosling joined the MRC Unit as a PhD student. At the outset, he worked alongside Maurice Wilkins (Box 2), another physicist-cum-biologist, and a veteran of the Manhattan Project racked with feelings of guilt. Wilkins and Gosling used ram's sperm as a source of DNA, following Randall's idea that ""ram's sperm have very flat heads - unlike human sperm, which is like a rugby football"", the benefit of which was that ""the long chains must lie in the plane of a ram's sperm head."" But Gosling's attempts to obtain X-ray diffraction patterns from these sperm did not meet with much success., It would take a series of what Gosling describes as ""serendipitous"" events to bring about a change in their fortunes (""most of my life has been beset or encouraged by serendipitous acts,"" he says). There happened to be one man who could produce a sample of DNA of far superior quality to that produced by any other laboratory, and that man was Swiss biochemist Rudolf Signer. By one or two strokes of luck, Gosling managed to obtain a fair quantity of this DNA: ""Signer gave a lecture at the Royal Society on this method that he'd developed to separate out the DNA from the nuclear protein and so produce high molecular weight pure DNA. Signer asked at the end of the lecture if anybody would like some of this material, and he had a specimen tube full of this freeze-dried material. Only two people put their hand up. I'm glad to say that Maurice was awake enough to put his hand up!"", Was that often not the case? ""It was often not the case! He rushed down to the front and got half of all there was, which turned out to be very necessary."", Initially, Gosling only wanted to use Signer's DNA as a control to determine which of six methods he had devised for making ram's sperm lie flat was most successful. Wilkins had ""a steady hand enough to pull fibers of 5 to 10 μm. Maurice pulled by wrapping them round a paperclip and then sort of - very scientific! - pushing it open to make them taut. I managed to get him to produce at least 35, so this is a 35 fiber specimen. And little blobs of LePage's cement, priced 6d in Woolworths down The Strand, pulling the fibers together. Very scientific!"", The act of pulling the fiber orientated the molecules along the fiber axis, akin to the orientation that flattening ram's sperm was aiming for. Gosling took the fibers from the Signer sample to the basement of the Chemistry Department, which housed a Raymax X-ray tube. ""The first thing I produced was even fuzzier than my ram's sperm! Randall was most amused, and he was delighted to be able to point out that I'd missed a trick because the material that was in my DNA was largely carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which was just the same as the atoms in the air inside the camera."" The result was a diffuse back-scattering of X-rays, which fogged the film, and so Gosling was instructed to displace all the air with hydrogen. And this is where the next piece of serendipity steps in., ""This Raymax tube was already in a frightening place, it was three floors below the ground level, which was the level of the Thames, about 50 yards away, because it was the basement of the Chemistry Department. And it was lead-lined so that the X-rays should be shut in because there were various lecture theatres nearby. So having realized that I needed to keep a watchful eye on the amount of hydrogen I was filling the room up with - so that I wasn't going to blow myself up and repeat the Hindenberg Disaster - I bubbled the hydrogen through water to help judge when the camera had been swept clean of air. It just so happened that this produced enough water vapor in the camera to be taken up by the fibers and produce crystallites. It turns out that freeze-dried DNA from Signer's preparation would form micro-crystallites in a humidity of 92%, and that was by serendipity alone that I just hit that value."", Gosling is in no doubt that this was ""the most exciting thing that's happened to me before or since!"" He can still remember the moment clearly: ""standing in the dark room outside this lead-lined room, and looking at the developer, and up through the developer tank swam this beautiful spotted photograph, you are familiar with them now I'm sure. It took 90-something hours to take the photograph, again, pot luck. But it really was the most wonderful thing. And I knew at the time that what I'd just done was to produce a crystalline state in these fibers, and if then the DNA was the gene material, I must be the first person ever to make genes crystallize."", Did Gosling realize at that moment that it would from then onwards just be a matter of time, that the structure of DNA was now in his grasp? ""Yes. Yes, that was why I could truly say it was my 'Eureka!' moment. I went back down the tunnels over to the Physics Department, where Wilkins used to spend his life, so he was still there. Wilkins realized even more certainly than I did that we had just crystallized genes. As with Randall, he was convinced that the DNA was the genetic material, and now he was convinced that the DNA could be made to crystallize. I can still remember vividly the excitement of showing this thing to Wilkins and drinking his sherry by the glass... by the gulpful."", Interestingly, Gosling's account diverges somewhat from that given by Wilkins in his Nobel lecture (Box 3). Another - understandable - omission from Wilkins' lecture is a somewhat unorthodox, and nevertheless essential, contribution he made to Gosling's first X-ray images of crystalline DNA (Figure 2). Gosling had ""sealed the conventional camera onto its base and the lid and so forth with vacuum wax and stuff that you used in order to keep air out. This was to keep the hydrogen in, of course. The collimator was made of heavy brass and although I could seal it to the outside of the camera, there was no way I could think of to really prevent the gas coming out of the collimator tube. To my great surprise, when I was showing him how far I had got, this rather shy Assistant Director of the MRC Unit said: 'Try this.' And he pulled out from his pocket a packet of Durex."" By a quirky twist of irony, the introduction of condoms to the story occurs after Gosling had ceased working on sperm, having switched to Signer's DNA, which was derived from calf thymus.

                    , Does the 'Assistant Director' refer to Maurice Wilkins? ""Yes. But he was painfully shy."", But he was such a dedicated scientist that he was willing to risk the embarrassment... ""To risk everything, yes, that's right! It was extraordinary, really."", The condom did the trick, and Gosling was able to produce some high quality X-ray images. This is where Jim Watson first enters the picture: ""there was a conference in Naples that was on the structure of biologically active molecules. Randall was invited to talk and said that he couldn't, so he sent Wilkins, and Wilkins showed our beautiful picture and said: 'Look boys!' Or rather more... I mean his lectures were as dry as dust, so in a dusty sort of way, he made it clear that they had crystallized the genetic material. Now, Watson was in the audience, and I was told by somebody else who was there that Watson up until then had been doing his usual trick of pretending to read the newspaper while everybody gave of their best results and so forth. And he actually... when the picture came up on the screen in Wilkins' lecture, he actually put his paper down. And so he was convinced then and there, that if the material could be crystallized, then the structure could be found and it was just a short step from one to the other."", Watson, having seen the fruits of Gosling's serendipity, asked Wilkins if he could join the MRC Unit, but was refused ""because Wilkins was afraid of him. He's quite scary, old Jim, on full flight."" Instead, he approached Bragg (Box 2) at Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory, where - by another stroke of serendipity (Box 4) - he ended up allocated a desk next to Francis Crick. And the rest, as they say, is history..., Meanwhile, Randall was not convinced that Wilkins and Gosling would ever learn enough crystallography ""to be able to solve this spotty diagram."" For this reason, Rosalind Franklin was recruited to the project; Gosling believes that her appointment is another key pillar of Randall's contribution to the double helix story, as her experimental talent proved invaluable., Famously, Franklin and Wilkins enjoyed - or, rather, did not enjoy - a very fractious relationship. Gosling sees it as a ""pure personality clash"", as well as a very unfortunate misunderstanding, which only came to light many years later. ""The whole trouble was that there was a meeting in Randall's office, where Rosalind turned up and Alex Stokes and myself were invited along to meet her, and Wilkins was off somewhere else. In his autobiography, I think he says that he was away in Wales with a new girlfriend. But that was the key to what followed, he wasn't there."" At this meeting, Gosling was assigned to work under Franklin, having previously been working with Wilkins., ""It was a very curious thing. Randall actually wrote to Rosalind saying that she would be asked to direct the X-ray crystallographic work on the Signer DNA material, and I didn't know that he'd done that."" As with Gosling, Wilkins himself was not made aware of this letter until many years later., Gosling believes that the misunderstanding was ""deliberate"" on Randall's part, rather than an unfortunate oversight. When he eventually discovered the truth of the matter, Gosling was ""really shocked"" because ""it was against all Randall's principles as I understood them. Up until then, everybody would freely discuss their work and interact with Wilkins probably more often than interacting with Randall directly."", Perhaps most peculiar in the whole episode is that Randall and Wilkins had known each other for many years, and had been close colleagues at several institutions. So what was Randall's motivation? ""He definitely subscribed to the divide and rule principle, as lots of people did. He thought it would make them competitive and improve their work."", Another school of thought might be that Randall did not think Wilkins up to the job of the matter at hand, but did not want to confront him directly about these concerns. However, when this theory is put to him, Gosling is unsure. But what is for certain is that Franklin had very much been told by Randall - ""this very dynamic Head of Department"" - that she was a post-graduate fellow and it was her research, not Wilkins'., ""Wilkins came back to the lab after a few days and, you know, said, 'How are you?' and 'What are you doing' sort of thing, and got her back up. It was very unfortunate."" Gosling, in the dark as much as everyone else, joined others in attributing this response to a Bolshie streak in Franklin's character, and also had sympathy for Wilkins, having previously worked closely with him. Now that he was Franklin's student, Gosling was very much caught in the middle: ""It was terrible, terrible. I spent my life going from one to the other, giving messages, trying to play the peacemaker."", Eventually, the dispute between Wilkins and Franklin resulted in Randall suggesting to Franklin that she had better leave, even though the DNA work was not yet complete - although he was good enough to ""fix her up with his old pal [JD] Bernal"" at Birkbeck., Later on, Wilkins was ""beset by worry that he had been responsible for not integrating Rosalind into the group"" and it very much lingered with him, to the extent that, for the rest of his life, he would frequently ask Gosling whether he had been unkind to her., All Hollywood script writers worth their salt know that a successful plot is built around a boy meeting a girl, losing the girl and then winning the girl back. Change a few nouns, and you pretty much have the story of the double helix: Crick and Watson 'discover' the structure, lose the 'discovery' when it turns out to be wrong, and then win back the discovery by coming up with a better model. Where they erred was in rushing to triumphalism with the first, incorrect, model: ""we suddenly received a call, in '51 I think it was, from Crick - from Maurice. Crick had got in touch with Maurice to say that he hoped he didn't mind, but they had built - him and Jim had built - a model of DNA as a double helix, following the results that we had deduced in structure 'B'. And would we like to go to Cambridge to see it?"", According to Gosling, it was clear to him then that the King's data, such as it was at the time, had fed into Watson and Crick's model. Nevertheless, Gosling, Franklin and Wilkins, together with their King's colleagues Bill Seeds and Geoffrey Brown, took the Liverpool Street train ""with a heavy heart"" to Cambridge. But, upon arrival, it was immediately apparent that Watson and Crick had made some elementary mistakes, in both senses of the word., ""We arrived in the lab to be shown the model and to the absolute relief of Rosalind and myself - I don't know about Wilkins, what he thought at the time, because I was dealing with my own thoughts and not observing other people - the boys had built a model with the phosphate linkages going up the middle of the thing, which gave it, of course, rigidity, and so you could hang all the nucleotides and things off the ends of the ionic chain. That must be wrong, because we knew that the water went into that phosphate-oxygen group, and there was an ionic linkage there between the sodium - it was the sodium salt of DNA - and the phosphate group, and you got eight molecules of water going in, quite a lot of water that would go in and come out very easily, as we had shown. So it meant that whatever the structure was, those phosphate groups had to be on the outside. And so we were delighted, and Bragg was embarrassed because it wasn't done to actually work on another man's problem."", Watson and Crick's recklessness, in playing their cards so early, was pounced upon by Franklin, who ""tore the model apart point by point."" As Gosling notes with some amusement, Crick was later to comment that Franklin's demolition of the model was the only time he ever saw Jim Watson at a loss for words. ""And I can believe it!"", So did Franklin deliver her criticism with obvious relish, or did she play it straight? ""Oh, no, with obvious relish! She reminded me very much of a particular lady in the University of St Andrews Physics Department that I worked in when I left King's, in which she'd turn up at seminars by new PhD students or the like and she would tear their suggestions apart. 'You're wrong, and you're wrong for the following reasons, one, two, three, four...'"", Gosling had, like Franklin, realized instantly that the model was wrong but did not join her in skewering its inadequacies. Why not? ""I left it to her. I didn't need to discuss it at all, I mean she was...she was on top of her form! My word, no."", Perhaps the famously negative portrayal of Franklin in Jim Watson's book 'The Double Helix' was payback for this moment? ""Yes. Oh, I'd never thought of it, but yes, that's true. The humiliation. He must have felt - that's the word - he must have felt humiliated. Who the hell is this woman telling me... Yes, you can see it more clearly looking back, can't you?"", Rather than focus on Jim Watson's humiliation, however, Gosling was at the time ""just happy that it meant that Rosalind and I could go back to the Strand and just get on with doing the mathematics. And it was ours to take as long as we liked."", Watson and Crick's misplaced haste really did seem to have handed the game to King's. When Wilkins reported what had happened to Randall, he was ""furious and stormed off to Cambridge to see Sir Lawrence, and Lawrence was apologetic and actually forbade the lads from doing any more work on DNA, and that it was a King's problem and that Crick had plenty to do on hemoglobin and that he should concentrate on getting his PhD."", With the ban imposed upon Watson and Crick, DNA would have remained a King's problem, were it not for Caltech's Linus Pauling (Box 2) and, moreover, the inexplicable indiscretion of Pauling's son Peter. Not content with having discovered pretty much everything else going in chemistry and molecular biology, Pauling had turned his attention to the structure of DNA. A physicist by training, Pauling had got under the skin of atoms and molecules with great success to describe the nature of the chemical bond and the secondary structure of proteins, and much else besides. So he seemed like a good bet in the race to discover the structure of DNA., Pauling's son Peter was at the time based in Cambridge, and somehow managed to leak the news of his father's interest in the question to Jim Watson. The prospect of losing to Pauling, who had already beaten him to the alpha-helix and beta-sheet, was too much for Bragg, and he allowed Watson and Crick to start work on DNA again., It so happens that the first papers Pauling wrote on the subject actually contained the same mistake made by Watson and Crick, in that the phosphates were on the inside. Further, his proposed structure was a triple, rather than a double, helix [7, 8]. It was very wide of the mark, but the threat of Pauling's intellectual prowess was not to be underestimated., Does Gosling believe that Bragg's reaction was justified? After all, a draft manuscript written by Franklin shows that she had already drawn many correct conclusions about DNA's structure, including its double helical nature. Would Pauling have arrived at the model before King's with Cambridge out of the race? ""That's the problem. That's the $64,000 question I've been asked so many times. 'How long would it have taken you?' And I don't know."", Franklin's methodological approach was not that of someone in a race to the prize, but instead favored slow, steady progress. Franklin's skills as a chemist had borne fruit in determining that there were two crystalline forms of DNA, dependent on the humidity; the respective forms at lower and higher humidity were christened by Gosling and Franklin 'A' and 'B'. It was accepted that 'B' would be the in vivo form, due to its formation in humid conditions, and Franklin had taken an exceptionally high quality X-ray diffraction pattern of this form ('photo 51', see Figure 3), which proved invaluable to Watson and Crick. From the King's data, it was clear that 'B' was helical, but this could not be said with certainty for 'A' (Figure 4).

                    , Franklin had set herself the task of deducing the structure of 'A' from first principles, using Patterson functions, and she was having quite some success in doing so. ""We were the first people ever to do a cylindrical Patterson. But now nobody does it, because the computer would do it for you in a twink. And so you would probably go straight to an atomic density map, rather than vectors."", But why the focus on 'A', given that this was known not to be the biologically relevant form? ""Well, that's hindsight, isn't it. Her answer would have been, 'we've got over 100 diffraction spots, so we can do all the mathematics of the Patterson function.'"" Such data were not available for 'B', and Franklin's preference for sticking to first principles, and aversion to playing about with models and ""guesswork"", was the deciding factor., Another obstacle for Gosling was his ignorance of space groups. ""Alex Stokes (Box 2) had taught me enough crystallography that I had been able, before Rosalind was even appointed, to index the spotty picture that I had produced, and find the unit cell and therefore the symmetry that the molecule must exhibit. I got the space group right, I got all the major indices right. But what I didn't realize was that the C2 space group meant that there must be a dyad axis perpendicular to the fiber axis. The density values, which determine how many strings of the molecule are per unit cell, could in our case be two or four, and we were getting an answer for the density, which was a bit difficult to measure, between two and three. Now Crick realized immediately from my unit cell data that there must be a dyad axis and therefore, if this double diamond was showing a helical pattern, it meant there was a double helix."", The reason Crick knew all about this space group was that he was studying, under Bragg, the structure of hemoglobin, which just so happens to share the same space group. So another bit of serendipity? ""Absolutely."", The slow pace at King's was no match for the fury of Watson and Crick's efforts, and so it came to pass that Gosling, Franklin and company were called up to Cambridge a second time..., ""We went up, saw the structure, we came back to King's and looked at our Pattersons, and every section of our Pattersons we looked at screamed at you, 'double helix!' And it was just there! - once you knew what to look for. It was amazing."", When Gosling saw this second structure - the double helix we are now so familiar with - for the first time, was it as obvious to him that this model was right as it had been that the first model was wrong? ""Absolutely. Absolutely, because it was so elegant. And it also explained the diffraction pattern as being such a clear double helix because the phosphate groups were on the outside, the sodium then was ionically bonded to the phosphorous, and the eight molecules of water went into the same group. So you got this enormous scattering power, due to the electronic number of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon."", It wasn't just the phosphates on the outside that made the model so convincing, but also the ""stuff in the middle."" For one thing, it made a lot of sense that the identities of the nucleotides could be changed without impacting on the overall structure. For another, the nucleotides' ""stair rods looked identical to the X-rays because of the way they were bonded."" More importantly, Watson and Crick took Chargaff's (Box 2) finding that ""no matter which DNA he studied, there was always a 1:1 ratio of adenine to cytosine, and guanine to thymine, and that meant that these were identical"" and incorporated it into the model in the form of complementary base pairing. With this seemingly simple rule, suddenly ""the solution to DNA's reproductivity was so simple."", Chargaff's ratio was already in the public domain, before Watson and Crick's model was unveiled, but ""no one had made the connection"" that this meant the DNA structure would rely on complementary base pairing, nor that this ""was necessary to explain how the DNA replicated."", So, given that the double helix and all its features were already present in Franklin and Gosling's data, but had somehow been opaque to them, perhaps it was a good thing that Watson and Crick worked on their model, even if by surreptitious means, and the injustice really was more the lack of attribution? Gosling agrees. ""I think so. We would have, I think, got there eventually. But Crick himself has said, and Wilkins has agreed with him, that if they hadn't built the model, we would have got there at King's, but not in one fell swoop, that it would have come out in dribs and drabs about the various aspects."", And, as a consequence, history would have been deprived of a singularly exciting moment? ""That's right. That 'eureka!' moment, as Jim himself admits to, when you know that that specific pairing is there, and it's in the literature! And then, I can quite sympathize with him in a way, such a very strange feeling. Because I think it was Bernard Shaw who said that very few people are lucky enough to have an original thought in their whole lives. But there I was presented with mine, the crystallization of DNA, as he was, on a plate. Dong! Light bulb!"", Gosling readily offers his admiration for Crick and Watson's achievement: ""they'd not only put together a model showing that the DNA was in the form of a double helix, but that it had this dyad axis and that this meant that these stair rods of the nucleotides had to be specifically paired - now that was worth a Nobel Prize."", Similarly, Franklin reacted to this second model with a level of grace to equal the schadenfreude with which she had destroyed the first. ""If you look at the BBC 'Secret of Life' documentary, which is absolutely brilliant - it really is a wonderful thing - they have a shot there, which is of course made up, but it has Rosalind Franklin by herself looking at the model in Crick's lab. And Bragg comes in and says something like, 'Do you have any regrets...' - or something like that - '...Miss Franklin.' And Miss Franklin apparently said, 'No, we all stand on each other's shoulders.' And that stuck in my mind. Whether she said it or not, I don't know. But that was her attitude that she took when she and I were discussing it."", To her credit, Franklin ""absolutely"" put science before ego. However, at the time, she was not aware of the extent to which Watson and Crick had based their model upon her data. Does Gosling believe she came to know about this before her death in 1958? ""Yes. Oh, she did know about that."", Perhaps surprisingly, given the iconic nature of the double helix today, the 1953 discovery did not initially have much impact, as Gosling saw it. An illustration of this might be the difficulty he had finding work following his PhD - there were no opportunities for him to stay at King's, which he would have gladly done., ""I talked about DNA for about a year after I wrote my PhD because I was convinced that it would only take a year... that the structure of DNA now being known, the ability to control carcinogenic activity within any tissue you like would be available in two or three years' time. And when two or three years came and went, and nobody had shown that you could... 'Alright, so a double helix, so what?'"", Due to Franklin's enforced move to Birkbeck, Gosling ended up writing his thesis away from King's, under her guidance. This annoyed Randall somewhat, as he was ""of the old school, who... in those days, nobody but the Professor had PhD research students."" Randall's response to the situation was to appoint himself as Gosling's internal viva (thesis defense) examiner, and he roped in Bernal as the external examiner. Oddly, when you consider that the content of his thesis amounted to a not insignificant contribution to the discovery of DNA's structure, the prospect of his viva with Randall ""scared the pants off"" Gosling. In part, he explains, this was because his studentship had begun by ""trying to establish what the problem was"", due to the ""amorphous"" state of biophysics, rather than starting off with a ""ready-made problem"", as his friends in Ingold's Chemistry Department at University College had done., Given that his studentship had been under Randall's direction, the idea that Randall would then find fault with Gosling's rationale in the viva is hard to resolve, outside of a Kafka novel perhaps. ""Yes! Very Kafkaesque, yes."", But, still, he surely cannot have been too afraid of defending a thesis describing such successful work? ""Well, I can tell you, and I'll tell anybody, that the big difference between writing a paper - especially if you have co-authors - is you can always, when the discussion gets too heated, say you didn't write that bit, it was him! But with a thesis, you're aware that as you are writing each word, it can be attributed to you. And that's an odd feeling, especially when you know who your examiners are."", Gosling's fear did not end with the anticipation of his viva, but progressed into the examination itself. ""Randall and Bernal had obviously had a very good lunch. I went in there at 2 o'clock, and at half past five, they were still going on talking about the origin of life. I was hardly asked a question. The two of them were at it hammer-and-tongs. I was terrified. I was just terrified, because I was convinced that Bernal was a genius - one of only three I have met in my life, together with Crick and Haldane (Box 5)."", Having become disillusioned about the failure of the double helix to make much of an impression, Gosling lost interest and drifted away from the field. He had in any case wanted to move closer to his original dream, medicine, and did indeed go on to lead a successful career as a medical physicist (Box 6)., But an unexpected development suddenly cast the double helix in the spotlight, and spawned a legend that solidified its place in popular culture. Jim Watson wrote a book. In Gosling's eyes, ""that's what did it"" for the double helix. And that's where Gosling's praise for Watson's book - 'The Double Helix' [5] - ends., ""That book is a novel. A very successful novel, but it is a novel. Wilkins and Crick wrote to Harvard saying they should not publish this book, and they didn't."" But someone else did., Another unhappy reader of 'The Double Helix' was Max Perutz. While Watson and Crick obtained some of the King's data through Crick's friendship with Maurice Wilkins (""Innocently. Because he'd always discussed his work, as Crick had with him, from their undergraduate days.""), other data came from a progress report submitted to the MRC, which Watson had obtained from Perutz., ""I actually had a letter that I can no longer find from Perutz saying that he wanted me to be assured that he did not rush down the corridor waving the MRC report containing our contribution about the size and shape of the molecule. It's true they had actually got it from him. But the way Watson tells it, it's sort of Archimedes getting out of the bathtub again, you know."", Key for Crick and Wilkins was their dismay at the portrayal of Rosalind Franklin, which amounted to what you might describe as an ad hominem character assassination, and a wildly inaccurate one at that. Worse still, Franklin had died of ovarian cancer several years earlier, and so was not able to defend herself. Was Gosling also angry about how she had been portrayed? ""Yes. Very much so."", But he is gratified that many people rose to Rosalind's defense (""her part in it now is if anything overplayed!""), and in particular that Brenda Maddox's ""first class"" biography of Franklin was able to set the record straight [2]. Unwittingly, Watson is responsible for the widespread admiration with which Franklin is viewed today, which is to a large degree a reaction to his book., How did Gosling feel about his own portrayal in 'The Double Helix'? Was he concerned that his role had been underplayed? ""No, not really. But I felt that Watson was so busy criticizing poor Rosalind that he didn't mention and give credit to the work of Alex Stokes and Wilkins and myself. And Randall."", Despite his strong reservations about 'The Double Helix', Gosling acknowledges that Watson has much to be complimented for. ""He is very precocious, he is one year younger than me, which annoys me - ha! - and he is without doubt a very lively mind and his ability to spot that specific pairing was worth the Nobel Prize."", As mentioned previously, Gosling's subsequent career deviated from biology (Box 6), and he didn't follow the progress of molecular biology during this time (""not at all!""). This scientific realignment proved problematic on one occasion during his tenure at the University of the West Indies, when he was asked to deliver a lecture to the Trinidad campus on what his discovery was leading to. ""I hadn't the foggiest! So I had to bone up, and that was incredible."", Asked jocularly whether he contacted Francis Crick for assistance, Gosling replies that, actually, he did! ""Well, yeah, I did have a conversation with Francis. And it was... the whole thing was fascinating, I mean to look into this new world."", When Gosling hears of developments that have come from his work at King's, does he feel connected to it? ""No, I feel detached, I really do - it's gone way ahead of where I was. But I realize that I don't go to the literature enough to say that I have kept up."", The 50th anniversary of the double helix reignited the world's interest in Ray Gosling, and suddenly he was invited to events alongside Nobel laureates and other giants of the molecular biology world - most of whom he had never met before, nor even been aware of their work. Gosling was particularly taken with Alec Jeffreys (""a very nice chap"") and Paul Nurse (""a very witty fellow indeed""), and was ""very flattered"" when Nurse invited him to contribute a brief memoir of the double helix to a time capsule for The Francis Crick Institute., Have any DNA-based developments caused him concern, in the same vein as the conflicted feelings felt by Wilkins and some other alumni of the Manhattan Project? ""No. But I do very much feel that I can't stress enough the critical stage we're at. Up until now evolution has occurred spontaneously, set in motion in all sorts of ways. And what is happening now is that our species are the first ever to have their hands on the levers controlling evolution. If you are a pessimist, you would say the glass is half empty, and you would think it's rather a sinister situation. So you have to take an optimistic point of view, at least I think you do."", Work on transgenic animals has made a strong impression on Gosling (he highlights the example of so-called spidergoats), as has the notion of an embryo with three genetic parents, in which maternal chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA originate from different individuals., Returning to his favorite theme of Randall, Gosling recalls how in later years the ringmaster of the double helix discovery focused his work on cilia. ""Randall again was ahead of his time, wasn't he? In concentrating on the cilia. Isn't that fascinating? How long's the old boy been dead? '84, gosh. He would have been so pleased, wouldn't he..."", To illustrate the level of treachery that his move from University College to King's College might have been perceived as, Gosling relates a practical joke that took place in the 1930s: ""The engineers at University College got into the front reception hall in King's and cut a hole in the belly of Reggie the Lion, who's their mascot, and filled it with rotten vegetables that they'd got from Covent Garden, and sealed it up and painted it and put it back where it was, which was on a special plinth above the entrance doors. And it was weeks while the beadles looked for the source of the smell, and that was I think the best rag that I ever came across."", Gosling claims here and elsewhere [11] that he was the first person to crystallize DNA purely by a stroke of luck: he had used water to monitor hydrogen and, serendipitously, the humidity absorbed by the DNA fibers from this water resulted in crystallization (see text)., In his Nobel lecture [12], however, Gosling's colleague Maurice Wilkins gives a different version of events: 'One reason for this success was that we kept the fibres moist. We remembered that, to obtain detailed X-ray patterns from proteins, [JD] Bernal had kept protein crystals in their mother liquor. It seemed likely that the configuration of all kinds of water-soluble biological macromolecules would depend on their aqueous environment.', Gosling relates how, having been refused entry to King's, Jim Watson ""was nonetheless convinced that he had to learn some basic crystallography, and then he'd be able to find the structure of DNA."" He approached Sir Lawrence Bragg and asked to join his Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and was accepted (""you didn't turn down a pair of willing hands which came self-funded.""), Because of the way the space requirements of his workers happened to be at that time, Bragg gave Watson a spare desk next to Francis Crick (""a thoroughly nice man""), who was ""already getting Sir Lawrence rather mad because - as Bragg was heard to say several times - the man never stopped talking. And this is true, the man was incredibly wired for looking at exciting new developments."" Crick had just come across the argument about whether DNA or protein was the genetic material, and had come to the conclusion it was the DNA. ""And here is this pop-eyed chap from America turning up, who is saying that is exactly what it is and the people in King's have got it, and we should build models - that's the way to go."", As with the base pairs they discovered, Gosling considers Watson and Crick to be the perfect complement to one another: Crick's ""genius"" and Watson's ""persistence""., Gosling notes the contrast between the experimentalists at King's and Watson and Crick, who ""never did an experiment in their lives, it was all deductive powers of reasoning."" Nevertheless, Gosling believes that those powers were very much worthy of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to them, alongside Maurice Wilkins, in 1962., Gosling believes he has met three geniuses in his lifetime: Francis Crick, JD Bernal and JB Haldane. ""Those three, I was lucky to meet. I mean, I don't think there are very many scientists who have the privilege."", He first met Haldane when an undergraduate at University College, but a later encounter was much more memorable., ""JB Haldane came to a conversazione at the Royal Institution, and it was time for the eaties to be dished out, and so I was the one who got the short straw and had to stay by the model in case anybody came to look at it. And there it was, this lovely double helix. And this Haldane shuffled up and started to roll a cigarette, and apparently he used the cheapest possible tobacco and Rizla paper, and made his own, like he was a student. Nowadays, you would have accused him of making a reefer, a joint. But he rolled it, took a few puffs and said, 'Well, now you will have to find an untw... tw... ...twiddlase.' Because he had an awful stammer, and that I remember vividly. I stood there awestruck, thinking about an untwiddlase! I mean, this was before the concept of telomeres. But he was on it. Incredible man."", After the initial double helix data had been published, Gosling and Franklin finished up their research into the structure of DNA with another article in Nature [13]. Gosling continued to work in crystallography for a few years, focusing on the structure of nucleotides, but spent most of his career as a medical physicist, developing devices for the study and diagnosis of atherosclerosis., The idea to perform this work originated from a discussion he had while based at the University of the West Indies. ""Again, a somewhat serendipitous situation developed, in that I got to know very well indeed the senior lecturer in morbid anatomy. He wanted an explanation as to why the fatty plaques should develop in arteries where the blood was moving fastest, that this was an anomalous situation, and all of the work that was being done on atherosclerosis - on atherogenesis, if you like - at that time was being done by biochemists. And he said, surely, isn't there a big hole here for someone who is a biophysicist to look at the characteristics of the pulsatile flow, and that must play a part in the formation of these plaques."", Gosling began the project while on a sabbatical back in Randall's laboratory at King's and, while there, Randall persuaded him to change tack. ""One day in my little lab, Randall appeared. And he had this terrifying habit of doing just that. I mean, he walked around with hush puppies and you couldn't hear him coming, and suddenly you were in an empty lab and then the next thing you know, he's at your elbow. Terribly dangerous! But what he said was illuminating. He'd come down to find me because he wanted me to stop building glass tubes with lumps inside, because if I did, and if I was successful in replicating the conditions, all that would happen is that some bloody physiologist would come along and pooh pooh the whole thing because it was not like the in vivo state, and that what I ought to do is to build an animal model and observe it directly in a living situation. And then he disappeared."", Gosling took Randall's advice and, when he returned to Jamaica, switched to working on cockerels, which turned out to be the best animal model available. Later, he continued his work on atherosclerosis at Guy's Hospital, London, where he developed ultrasound devices for the analysis and diagnosis of atheromatous plaques. This phase of his career included an important discovery., ""As the lumps developed, so it changed the elasticity of the artery wall. As you know, you get hardening of the arteries as they build up with atheromatous plaques, but we were able to show that, before that happens, they get three times more distensible, which was an unlooked for, unknown thing - counterintuitive."", Gosling found the direct impact he could see his work making in medical physics more satisfying than fundamental biology, and he also preferred the more steady rate of progress to the manic ups and downs of his years as a crystallographer. His time at King's, therefore, was a preamble to a rewarding and successful career that led Gosling in a very different direction to his fellow actors in the double helix story., Now retired, Gosling's contribution to science has been recognized in the form of election as a Fellow of King's College and the award of a DSc from the University of the West Indies. Inexplicably, Gosling has never received recognition in the Queen's honors system from the British government, although he was invited to meet Prime Minister Tony Blair at Downing Street in honor of the double helix's 50th anniversary."
"148","The complex binding of PRDM9","Laure Ségurel","Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago","Laure Ségurel","lsegurel@uchicago.edu","24 April 2013","","DNA binding, hotspots, meiotic recombination, PRDM9, zinc finger","A recent study investigates the in vitro DNA binding behavior of PRDM9, a zinc finger protein involved in the localization of recombination hotspots in mammals., Please see related research article: http://​genomebiology.​com/​2013/​14/​4/​R35
              , Billings et al. examined the minimum length of segments bound by PRDM9 at previously known hotspots using gel-shift assays, focusing on three hotspots bound by the PRDM9Cst variant (present in the CAST/Eij mouse strain) and one bound by the PRDM9Dom2 variant (present in the C57BL/6J mouse strain) [1]. PRDM9Cst has 11 fingers and therefore can bind up to 33 base pairs (bp), whereas PRDM9Dom2 has 12 fingers and hence can bind up to 36 bp. The authors found that the four hotspots (pre B cell leukemia homeobox 1 (Pbx1), H2.0-like homeobox (Hlx1), estrogen-related receptor gamma (Esrrg-1) and proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, beta type, 9 (Psmb9)) present a minimum-binding site between 30 and 34 bp, suggesting that PRDM9 uses all its zinc fingers to bind DNA. Importantly, as the authors note, the use of the full complement of PRDM9's zinc fingers for binding suggests that PRDM9 binds continuously to DNA for more than one helical turn, a conclusion further supported by the finding that binding is inhibited by the addition of Mg2+., At first glance, this result seems to contrast with previous computational analyses that found a hotspot consensus motif matching only to the second half of PRDM9's zinc finger domain (Figure 1) [2–4]. However, in humans, it was reported that bases flanking the central motif and extending up to 50 bp are significantly over-represented in hotspots, relative to matched coldspots, and show a threefold periodicity, indicative of zinc finger binding [3]. This is consistent with the conclusion that all fingers of PRDM9 are used for binding, therefore recognizing a longer motif than the consensus one.

                        PRDM9 binding predictions and hotspot consensus motifs in humans (A and C variant [3, 4]) and mice (C57BL/10.F strain [2]). Binding predictions were obtained from the polynomial model described by Persikov et al. [9].
                    , For one hotspot (Hlx1), Billings et al. further mutated each of the 31 positions of the binding site. This revealed great variability in specificity among bases, with high specificity for those matching the first half of the zinc finger domain (especially the fingers 4 to 6). On that basis, they propose that the other, less specific fingers are used to stabilize the protein-DNA complex., Billings et al. then compare the sequences bound by PRDM9Cst at the three hotspots analyzed, finding that the three sequences have little in common, even though they are able to compete with each other for binding to PRDM9 in gel-shift assays. Furthermore, the few matches seem equally distributed among different fingers. One interpretation is that PRDM9 is able to bind to a mixture of different motifs, thus resolving the apparent paradox that PRDM9 is at the same time very permissive (in that it can bind to degenerate versions of the consensus motif) and highly sensitive (in that specific mutations can completely knock down hotspot activity [5]). This hypothesis would also explain why, in humans, PRDM9 was shown to influence both hotspots containing and lacking an exact match to the consensus motif [6, 7], and would further suggest that there is a greater variety of target sequences in Western chimpanzees, where no consensus motif could be found [8], than in humans. More generally, these results raise the question of how many distinct motifs coexist for PRDM9 in humans and other species., As the authors state, the intriguing results of this study raise as many questions as they answer. Notably, the study reports that instances of the same zinc fingers repeated along the protein do not share the same DNA specificity, and so the protein-DNA interaction seems to be highly context-dependent. The source of this dependence, however, remains unclear, highlighting that we still have a limited understanding of the behavior of long zinc fingers, or perhaps that PRDM9 presents unusual features., To deepen our understanding of this enigmatic protein, we need to know where it binds in vivo genome-wide (for example, through PRDM9 ChIP-seq data), and to compare these locations with those of double-strand breaks (for example, as identified in mice through ChIP-seq of disrupted meiotic cDNA 1 homolog (DMC1) by Smagulova et al. [2]). It would also be helpful to characterize how PRDM9 binding is affected by chromatin organization or by the presence of other co-factors. Such analyses would help to understand why, even though there are hundreds of thousands of motifs for any version of PRDM9, only a small subset yields double-strand breaks. In turn, an answer to this question may help to understand what constraints restrict the state space of possible motifs to which PRDM9 could bind. In the longer term, the goal is to be able to predict, for a given variant, where double-strand breaks will occur. Such a complete understanding may be of practical use in engineering specific breaks in the genome and, regardless, will yield important insights into evolutionary biology and human genetics."

However, genome-wide DNA copy number analyses are complicated by variations in detection signal., While GC content has been used to correct for this, here we show that coverage biases are tissue-specific and independent of the detection method as demonstrated by next-generation sequencing and array CGH. Moreover, we show that DNA isolation stringency affects the degree of equimolar coverage and that the observed biases coincide with chromatin characteristics like gene expression, genomic isochores, and replication timing., These results indicate that chromatin organization is a main determinant for differential DNA retrieval. These findings are highly relevant for germline and somatic DNA copy number variation analyses.","Copy number variation, DNA isolation, Technological bias, Tissue specificity","The ability to accurately detect DNA copy number variation (CNV) in both a sensitive and quantitative manner is important in many research areas. While the detection of CNVs previously relied on low resolution techniques like quantitative PCR or MLPA, high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based depth of read coverage (DOC) approaches [1] now allow for detailed genome-wide analyses. However, both aCGH and DOC are complicated by the presence of 'wave patterns' in the raw data where the measurement deviates systematically from equimolar representation. These regions span up to tens of megabases and pose challenges on CNV calling. To reduce the number of false-positive calls introduced, algorithms were designed to suppress wave effects [2–6]. In these studies, quantity of DNA during hybridization, dye-biases, enzymatic effects, and correlations with GC content were proposed as the main contributors to the wave patterns. However, understanding the source of the observed patterns is important for reliable genome-wide analyses based on aCGH and NGS techniques., To discover the source of unequal DNA representation in genomic data we performed pairwise aCGH analyses comparing all possible combinations of DNA samples isolated from blood, brain, liver, and testis from two rats from different inbred strains. We observed large-scale tissue-specific variation in hybridization intensities that were reproducible between strains and consistent in dye-swap experiments (Figure 1A). Fold-changes for this variation could computationally be defined as tissue-specific CNVs (within the same strain) and were typically much lower than for germline CNVs (between strains). Even though the amplitude of variation did not exceed 30%, the reproducibility of tissue-specific differences between multiple rat strains was very high, both in terms of pattern and magnitude (Figure 1A). Theoretically, these patterns could reflect somatic copy number changes, in line with recently observed somatic heterogeneity [7–9]. Nevertheless, systematic artifacts of the methods used might also underlie such observations. In support of a potential systematic artifact we noted that the genomic regions involved are often megabases in size, while regular CNVs are typically much shorter. Although aCGH analyses using different platforms (Nimblegen and Agilent) and labeling techniques revealed highly similar patterns (not shown), shared artifacts associated with aCGH such as dye or sequence-dependent hybridization effects cannot be excluded. Therefore, we performed a depth of coverage analysis on four tissues from a single animal using NGS-based low-pass whole genome sequencing (5-10 M reads per sample) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, both aCGH and NGS show highly similar DNA content patterns (r2 = 0.71, P < 0.001, Additional file 1), excluding previously proposed array-specific artifacts [2–5, 10] as the sole basis for the observed patterns and suggesting a common source for the observed variation.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Reproducible patterns in genome-wide aCGH and NGS data. (A) Pairwise aCGH analysis results of blood, liver, brain, and testis samples for rat chromosome 16. For all panels, the variability in log2 ratios is displayed (each dot represents the median value over 100 consecutive probes). The top two panels show dye swap aCGH (Nimblegen) results using blood and liver samples from a single animal (Brown Norway strain). The third panel shows the comparison of blood and liver from an animal from a different inbred strain (ACI). The bottom panel shows the aCGH analysis results between brain and testis of that same ACI animal. (B) Comparison of aCGH hybridization signal with NGS depth of coverage analysis results. DNA isolated from the testis and from blood of the same animal was analyzed by aCGH (Nimblegen) and by low-pass next-generation sequencing (6.3-7.2 M reads; 0.075× - 0.086× genome coverage).
                    , Systematic analysis of genomic regions with tissue-specific differences in aCGH hybridization and DOC signal revealed several interesting characteristics. A very clear correlation was found with replication timing [11], gene density, presence of SINE elements, and the relative GC content, which is strongly related to isochores [12, 13] (Figure 2, Additional file 2). GC content has been documented to affect a wide range of molecular biological techniques, including PCR and next-generation sequencing [6] and may thus explain part of the observed patterns. Regional high GC content was recently described to affect the thermostability of DNA, resulting in ultra-fastened regions that affect amplification [14]. However, as DNA content is assumed to be largely the same in every cell, the GC content alone cannot explain the observed tissue-specific patterns or differences in signal magnitude (Figure 1). When we perform a GC correction on the aCGH data, this flattens out large parts of the pattern, as expected based on the high correlation with GC. However, the GC correction alone is insufficient to flatten the profile between different tissues from the same animal (Figure 3). As we used asynchronous whole tissue samples with only a very small amount of actively proliferating cells, early replicating genomic regions are also unlikely the cause of apparent copy number gains. Intriguingly, replication timing has been shown to correlate with retrotransposon content, genome isochores, and gene expression activity [15], and all of these factors are known to be highly related to chromatin status. Therefore, we hypothesized that tissue-specific chromatin organization may explain the observed correlations and that non-equimolar representation might be due to DNA retrieval artifacts that result in differential representation of euchromatin compared to more densely packed heterochromatin. In support of this, we do observe prominent tissue-specific gene expression in regions with higher apparent tissue-specific copy number status (Additional file 3).

The middle panel shows aCGH results comparing BN blood versus BN liver DNA and is aligned with replication timing (early replication is represented by high values, data obtained from Ryba et al. [11]), SINE distribution, GC content (100 kb windows), and gene density. Pearson correlation scores (r) are given per comparison. For each, P values are < 0.001. For this visualization, genomic positions of rat aCGH data were translated to positions on the first 50 Mb of human chromosome 2 (HSA2) to be able to compare rat data with human data on replication timing.

                        GC correction reduces, but does not diminish tissue-specificity in aCGH signal intensity. The red line depicts the GC content in percentage (secondary y-axis) across rat chromosome 16. The dashed black line shows the log2 aCGH signal intensity of brain versus testis (ACI rat strain). The black line shows the signal intensity after GC correction. Specific peaks at high GC regions are visibly removed (for example, at 18 Mb), while others are not (for example, at 28 Mb).
                    , To study a potential bias resulting from differential chromatin status and introduced during the DNA isolation procedure, we first isolated DNA using standard phenol/chloroform extraction procedures and a commercial DNA isolation kit. aCGH was used to measure potential differences in relative DNA content between the two extraction methods but no significant differences were observed (Additional file 4). Next, we modulated the stringency of extraction by varying proteinase K treatment conditions prior to phenol/chloroform extraction, and used NGS fragment sequencing to determine the DNA recovery patterns across the whole genome. We compared five different lysis durations in the presence of proteinase K and observed that increased duration of treatment improved the evenness of read distribution across the whole genome (thus lowering the wave-amplitude; Figure 4A). Especially in the more difficult to cover regions the increased treatment duration improved coverage (Figure 4B). Next, we determined if the increased duration of the treatment also reduced the tissue-specific differences as depicted in Figure 1. By comparing sequenced DNA from homogenized brain and liver samples of the same animal at four time points, we indeed find that an increased lysis time results in smaller tissue-specific differences (Figure 4C), although it should be noted that biases are not removed. In agreement with our previous observations, the results of copy number profiling of brain and liver samples are affected by proteinase K treatment duration, even after GC correction. While segments totaling to 45 Mb show copy number differences of at least 10% after a 30-min proteinase K treatment, only 1.3 Mb exhibit changes of this scale when treatment is done overnight (Additional file 5).
                    Figure 4
                      
                        The duration of proteinase K exposure affects the evenness of genome-wide read distribution. (A) For five different durations of lysis (10, 30, 60, 120 min, and overnight (O/N)), the evenness of coverage is determined by calculating the number of 20 kb windows and the number of sequencing reads therein. The y-axis displays the genome-wide number of windows (X 1,000) while the x-axis depicts the number of quantile normalized reads. The width of the curve shows the genome-wide variation in read-depth between all windows. (B) Zoomed-in region of (A) to illustrate the read differences in windows with relatively difficult to cover genomic regions. (C) Genome-wide tissue-specific differences in read-depth per window are displayed for brain and liver at four different durations of lysis (30, 60, 120 min, and overnight). (D) Comparison of the genome-wide read distribution for a sample treated 10 min with proteinase K (blue line), and the exact same DNA sample after 120 min of extra proteinase K treatment (black line).
                    , These results demonstrate that the observed wave patterns are the result of combined tissue-specific DNA isolation biases. As the magnitude, but not the pattern, of the biases decreases with longer proteinase K treatment (Additional file 6), we postulate that DNA retrieval effects are due to differences in degradation of DNA/protein complexes, which subsequently results in depletion of stable aggregates by early precipitation or separation into the phenol phase. Densely packed heterochromatic regions, but also nuclear lamina attached chromatin, are likely to be most affected by such process., To test whether the DNA in the under-represented genomic regions was simply absent from the sample, or just inaccessible for subsequent applications like sequencing or aCGH, we modulated the DNA isolation experiments even further. First, DNA was extracted after only 10 min of lysis in the presence of proteinase K. After one initial round of phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation, the sample was divided in half. One part was treated with proteinase K for 2 additional hours, while the other was used as a control and left untreated. We subsequently extracted the DNA from both samples using a second round of phenol/chloroform extraction. Surprisingly, the NGS data show that an additional 2 h of treatment dramatically improves the evenness of the genome-wide coverage as compared to the control sample (Figure 4D), now resembling the read distribution of samples that were treated for a minimum of 2 h. This suggests either that inaccessible DNA was present after the first phenol/chloroform extraction and made accessible by the additional proteinase K treatment, or that the second phenol/chloroform purification step removed additional protein-bound DNA from the control sample. In any case, these experiments further demonstrate that equimolar DNA representation is affected by differences in DNA isolation conditions., We demonstrate that DNA isolation procedures can introduce a systematic bias that contributes to the wave effects in aCGH data and the variation in coverage depth in NGS data. We show that extended lysis with proteinase K treatment results in: (1) more even representation of NGS reads across the genome; (2) more similar representation of DNA derived from different tissue sources; and (3) improved DNA content uniformity for a previously undertreated DNA sample. Our data show that the basis for the observed bias is tissue-specific and related to specific chromatin characteristics. Interestingly, from the four tissues that we sampled in this study, brain showed the lowest variation in NGS read coverage. This could reflect the diversity of cell types within this tissue and the associated increased variety of chromatin conformations. More homogeneous tissues like blood and liver exhibited the largest bias in read coverage (Additional file 7), again supporting a cell type-specific origin of the effects rather than primary DNA characteristics. Tissue-specific chromatin characteristics could originate from protein-DNA interactions, 3D organization, and epigenetic modifications., The observations presented in this study are relevant for a wide range of genomics techniques. Obviously, the described artifacts affect the accuracy of CNV detection [16, 17], in particular somatic CNV analyses such as in cancer where sample heterogeneity requires accurate detection of relatively small changes. Furthermore, genome-wide nucleotide variation analyses using next-generation sequencing may also be affected, as depleted regions will have lower sequencing coverage, which results in lower reliability of variant calling. Accurate experimental reflection of the original amounts of DNA is also important for other genomics techniques, as was recently demonstrated for ChIP-seq experiments [18]. As none of the methods or conditions tested could completely remove the signal bias, special care should be taken to control for potential DNA isolation and tissue-specific effects in experiments involving quantitative DNA interpretation. Furthermore, detection of somatic copy number variation will require independent measurements, for example, using allele imbalances [7, 8]., All sequencing data are available from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at EBI under accession number (ERP001927). Array CGH data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at NCBI under accession number (GSE45308). Whole genome aCGH plots for tissue comparisons are available as Additional file 8 (ACI blood versus liver and brain versus testis; BN blood versus liver and liver versus blood)."

In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9), a long-array zinc-finger and chromatin-modifier protein. Determining the rules governing the DNA binding of PRDM9 is a major issue in understanding how it functions., Mouse PRDM9 protein variants bind to hotspot DNA sequences in a manner that is specific for both PRDM9 and DNA haplotypes, and that in vitro binding parallels its in vivo biological activity.

                  , was tested by mutating each nucleotide to its three alternatives. The 31 positions along the binding site varied considerably in the ability of alternative bases to support binding, which also implicates a role for additional binding to the DNA phosphate backbone., These results, which provide the first detailed mapping of PRDM9 binding to DNA and, to our knowledge, the most detailed analysis yet of DNA binding by a long zinc-finger array, make clear that the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex.","recombination hotspots, PRDM9, DNA binding, EMSA, zinc-finger proteins","Genetic recombination is an essential feature of meiosis, assuring an appropriate segregation of chromatids at the first meiotic division, and generating an evolutionarily important source of genetic variation by providing new arrangements of alleles between genes linked on the same chromosome. In many organisms, notably yeast [1], higher plants [2], and mammals including humans and mice [3–5], recombination is concentrated along chromosomes at limited sites known as 'hotspots'. Typically a kilobase in extent, hotspots are surrounded by long stretches of DNA, tens to hundreds of kilobases in extent, that are essentially devoid of recombination in humans and mice., Recently, several groups have shown that PR domain member 9 (PRDM9), a zinc-finger (ZF) protein with histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase activity, plays a key role in determining the locations of hotspots in both mice and humans [6–8]. It is presently proposed that PRDM9 binds to appropriate DNA sequences in meiotic chromatids, generates activated chromatin by virtue of its H3K4 methyltransferase activity, and somehow guides the generation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at those sites by the topoisomerase-like protein SPO11 [9]. Analyses of individual human hotspots and a number of genome-wide studies have implicated PRDM9 as the predominant regulator of hotspot placement [6, 7, 10, 11]. In mice, analyses of genome-wide hotspots of DSB formation [12] make it clear that PRDM9 determines the location of virtually all hotspots, with the clear exception of the obligate crossover at the pseudoautosomal region, at which recombination occurs equally well with different variants of PRDM9 present, or indeed no variant at all. There is also evidence that Prdm9 participates in transcriptional regulation [13, 14], which may be related to its involvement in hybrid sterility [14]., Although PRDM9 plays a very important role in mammalian recombination, there is considerable uncertainty as to how it physically determines hotspot locations and then directs DSB formation there rather than at other trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4-me3) sites, of which there are many. Meeting these challenges has repercussions both for expanding the current understanding of recombination biology and for the insights this could provide in understanding the functions of other regulatory proteins with ZF arrays. More than 4% of human protein-coding genes contain ZF arrays, and half of those arrays are comparable in size with those present in PRDM9 [15–17]., The identification of PRDM9 as a regulator of human recombination [7] relied on the finding that the DNA sequence predicted to bind to the ZF array of the most common human variant (variant A) matched a 13 bp consensus sequence that characterizes 41% of human hotspots [18], and the fact that although this sequence is present in chimpanzee DNA, it does not characterize chimpanzee hotspots. Baudat et al. [6] correlated human hotspot activity with human allelic variation at PRDM9, and predicted a mouse PRDM9 DNA binding sequence found in a mouse hotspot. Parvanov et al. [8] identified Prdm9 in mice by genetically mapping the gene controlling hotspot activity to a 181 Kb interval containing four genes, three of which could be excluded as candidates., Although PRDM9 reportedly binds to hotspot DNA [6, 19], there is still considerable confusion about the nature of the DNA sequences recognized by the ZF array of PRDM9 and how this protein achieves its locational specificity. Many more copies of the human consensus sequence are found in the genome at non-hotspot sites than at the hotspots themselves [18], and Berg et al. [10] showed that human hotspots possessing or not possessing this consensus sequence are equally dependent on PRDM9. In mice, the consensus sequence originally predicted for the mouse PRDM9Cst variant [6] is more commonly present in non-hotspot than in hotspot regions, and the ZF prediction programs used in various studies [20–22] also predict that the mouse Dom2 variant of PRDM9 (PRDM9Dom2) should bind to hotspots that genetic studies have shown are not activated by this allele. Nevertheless, when tested experimentally, longer oligonucleotides containing buried sequences matching the predicted recognition motifs of two human PRDM9 alleles have been shown to bind PRDM9 protein expressed in cell cultures [6, 19]., To address the DNA binding problem experimentally, we expressed the mouse Prdm9
                Cst
                 allele (from the CAST/EiJ strain; referred to below as CAST) and the Prdm9
                Dom2
                 allele (from the C57BL/6J strain; referred to below as B6) in Escherichia coli. and determined the abilities of their respective protein products to bind DNA sequences from three mouse hotspots (Hlx1, Esrrg1, and Psmb9) known from genetic evidence to be activated by Pdrm9
                Cst
                 and one (Pbx1) known to be activated by Prdm9
                Dom2
                . Binding between expressed PRDM9 and DNA was tested both by the variant-specific ability of PRDM9 to modify the electrophoretic mobility of target DNA sequences and conversely, by the ability of DNA binding-site sequences to physically sequester PRDM9., Taken together, our results confirm that the binding seen with PRDM9 expressed in E. coli correctly recapitulates the biological specificities of PRDM9, including its allelic specificity, the haplotype specificity of its target, and the location of the binding sites near the peaks of hotspot H3K4 trimethylation detected in vivo. Moreover, the correlation between the binding affinities of different Hlx1 haplotypes and their genetically measured rates of crossover also suggest that the strength of the physical binding of PRDM9 to hotspot sequences may determine the efficiency of recombination initiation. There was little sequence similarity between the several binding sites for the same PRDM9 variant, and the binding specificities of individual fingers appeared to be context-dependent. Mutational analysis of the Hlx1 binding site indicates considerable variation between the ZFs in their contribution to overall binding affinity and the probable involvement of the DNA phosphate backbone., These findings have relevance to the general role of ZF arrays as a DNA-recognition motif in biology, given that ZF proteins are the most common DNA regulatory protein in vertebrate genomes, comprising over 4% of all protein-coding genes in humans, and that half of these contain 10 or more fingers. They are almost as common in invertebrates, in which they were first described [17]. The issues surrounding the DNA binding specificities of ZFs are both biological and chemical. Biologically, we want to derive a consensus binding sequence whose parameters predict the location and relative binding affinity of genomic binding sites, and then describe how these affinities relate to biological outcomes. Chemically, we want to understand how the specificity of binding sequences is determined by the atomic and molecular interactions between protein and DNA., PRDM9 provides a particularly useful system for addressing these issues. It is highly variable, with multiple variants available both within and between species. It is a multiply fingered protein, providing the opportunity to examine interactions between repeat fingers in the same protein. In addition, there are many thousands of binding sites in genomes, providing a considerable source of experimental material. To our knowledge, the data we now report provide the first detailed definition of the DNA binding specificities of a ZF protein with a long (> 10) array of contiguous fingers. What has emerged is a picture of considerable complexity, one that raises as many or more questions than it answers., Our findings introduce considerable complexity into efforts to understand DNA binding by long-array ZF proteins such as PRDM9. The binding sites for the PRDM9Cst variant are only very subtly related; identical ZFs show little constancy in the trinucleotides they bind, and a position weight matrix approach [27] failed in a search for a DNA binding motif common to genetically identified hotspots on mouse chromosomes 1 and 11 [5, 28]. Perhaps most surprising is the finding that binding requires DNA sequences involving more than one helical turn, even though the terminal nucleotide positions show little sequence specificity. To our knowledge, PRDM9 is the first long-array ZF protein to have its DNA binding specificity at separate binding sites compared in detail. At issue now are the biological question of how to solve the binding rules for PRDM9 and the chemical question of whether the binding complexities of PRDM9 are shared by the hundreds of other long-array ZF proteins that carry out a great diversity of biological functions."
"151","Single-cell biology meeting marks rebirth of an old science","Sten Linnarsson","Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet","Sten Linnarsson","sten.linnarsson@ki.se","19 April 2013","","","A report on the third Single Cell Analyses meeting, held at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, USA, March 6-9, 2013., More than 100 researchers gathered at a wintery Cold Spring Harbor in March for the third Single Cell Analyses meeting. Where the first meeting in 2009 was tiny, and the second two years later was still quite small, at this year's meeting the attendance was strong, and there was a definite feeling that this young field is here to stay. The contrast with that first meeting, four years ago, was stark. Then, participants were often struggling to even obtain data from single cells, much less make sense of it. This year, the technical challenges had clearly been fought, if not yet completely mastered, and solid progress was reported on many fronts., Some things had not changed, of course: the atmosphere at Cold Spring Harbor, always hospitable and efficient; the beautiful campus this time clad in a late but heavy winter snowfall; the friendliness and good judgment of the organizers, Nancy Allbritton (University of North Carolina, USA), Jim Eberwine (University of Pennsylvania, USA) and Scott Fraser (California Institute of Technology, USA); and the ample opportunities for informal chats and chance encounters in the dinner hall and evening bar., In a sense, single-cell analysis is as old as cell theory itself, going back all the way to the invention of microscopy and the first observations of individual cells by Robert Hooke. But in another sense, we are currently witnessing the birth of a new cross-disciplinary science. This is because only very recently has it become possible - through imaging and sequencing especially - to assay large numbers of single cells for multiple cellular properties in a quantitative manner. The result has been a new appreciation for the diversity of cells, the heterogeneity of cellular responses, and the way that population measurements can sometimes conceal and even completely misrepresent the true complexity of life., Some of the most impressive developments, as usual, were reported in imaging. Martin Chalfie (Columbia University, USA), the 2008 Nobel Laureate for his work on green fluorescent protein (GFP), opened the meeting with a look back at the development of GFP as a reporter, and how it is now used in his lab to dissect the development of touch sensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans., Along with powerful reporter proteins derived from GFP, improvements in imaging resolution and frame rate are bringing us ever closer to three-dimensional movies of the secret lives of cells. Hari Shroff (NIBIB, NIH, USA) showed how structured illumination microscopy (SIM) - traditionally a rather slow method but capable of surpassing the resolution limit of the light microscope - can be extended to multifocal SIM (MSIM), allowing acquisition rates 10- to 100-fold faster than standard SIM. The result? Awesome movies of organelles zipping around inside single cells., Similarly, Scott Fraser reported on recent progress in three-dimensional time-lapse whole-organism imaging, which has already furthered our understanding of embryogenesis by showing exactly when each cell divides, and where it goes. The dance of cells that seem to jostle and tug at each other in the embryo is not only fascinating to watch, but is sure to generate more rigorous data on developmental processes. For example, when the temporal resolution of image acquisition exceeds the rate of cell division and migration, the complete lineage tree of the organism can be deduced by tracing the three-dimensional path of each nucleus., The relentless pace of development of DNA sequencing technology has not only resulted in scaling up (of throughput), but also in a scaling down (of input DNA requirements), to the point where it is now feasible to sequence both genomes and transcriptomes of single cells. This is the area where progress since the first Single Cell Analyses meeting was the most noticeable., Xuyu Cai (Harvard Medical School, USA) reported that over 90% of the genome can be consistently recovered from single neuronal nuclei, with surprisingly even coverage. She applied single-genome sequencing to look at patterns of somatic mutations in normal human brains, finding both L1 transposition events and copy-number and single-nucleotide variations occur in normal brain development., Kun Zhang (University of California, San Diego, USA) showed a novel whole-genome amplification method, based on amplifying single cells in single microwells and then recovering the locally amplified product. The result was a significantly more even genome coverage, with a quality approaching that of bulk genome sequences., Gene expression analysis in single cells has also made great strides. Several groups showed high quality data from single cells, both using single-mRNA molecule detection by imaging (for example, Alexander van Oudenaarden of the Hubrecht Institute, the Netherlands, and MIT, USA, and Sanjay Tyagi of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, USA) and using RNA-seq (for example, our own work and that of Gouping Fan of the University of California, Los Angeles, USA). There was a clear trend towards more accurate measurements as well as the analysis of larger numbers of cells. With more accurate measurements comes the ability to study subtle quantitative processes such as transcriptional noise; and with large cell numbers, the ability to study intercellular heterogeneity. Expect more of these trends in the future., Two more trends were evident at the meeting. The first was the use of microfluidic devices tailored to the capture and analysis of single cells. This is a natural fit, of course, and there are now also the beginnings of a commercial market for single-cell analysis instruments outside of imaging (for example, the Fluidigm C1 AutoPrep for RNA-seq and quantitative PCR). Carl Hansen (Institute for Systems Biology, University of British Columbia, USA) showed how microfluidic devices could be used to analyze RNA and microRNA from very large numbers of single cells., The second was single-cell proteomics, traditionally a very difficult proposition. In a very impressive talk, Sean Bendall (Stanford University, USA) showed how the trajectory of B cell development could be dissected in detail using mass cytometry, a relatively new method capable of simultaneous measurement of several tens of proteins in single cells with extremely high throughput., The meeting was not characterized by a single major development, but rather by good solid progress on all fronts. It is clear by now that single-cell analysis is here to stay, and that it is poised to have a major impact on many disciplines. Conspicuous by its absence was any hint of clear applications in the clinic, probably because single-cell analysis remains technically challenging. I expect this to change rapidly in the coming few years as technology matures, and experimental designs become increasingly sophisticated. In particular, cancer would seem a natural first clinical application, because of the natural genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic heterogeneity of tumors, and because multiple tiny subpopulations of cells (for example, cancer stem cells, circulating tumor cells and treatment-induced drug-resistant clones) play such an outsized role in the disease."

              , functional validation, language, next-generation sequencing, neurodevelopmental disorders, speech","Next-generation sequencing is set to transform the discovery of genes underlying neurodevelopmental disorders, and so offer important insights into the biological bases of spoken language. Success will depend on functional assessments in neuronal cell lines, animal models and humans themselves., The human capacity for complex spoken language is unique [1]. Speech endows us with the ability to verbally express our ideas, opinions and feelings, using rapid precise control of the oral motor structures (larynx, mouth, tongue) to convert our thoughts into streams of sound that can be decoded by others. While vocal communication in other species sometimes exploits simple mappings between sound and meaning, the reach of human language extends far beyond this, most notably through its extraordinary generative power. A discrete number of individual units of language can be combined into a limitless number of utterances, giving us the potential to express and comprehend an infinite array of concepts. Moreover, when growing up in a language-rich environment, any normal human infant becomes highly proficient in his or her native language with astonishing ease, and without the need for explicit teaching., It has been argued for many years that inherited factors must make a key contribution to the acquisition of spoken language [2]. It is only in the past decade or so, with the rise of molecular genetics, that biologists have been able to provide the first robust empirical evidence regarding this issue. To begin investigating the pathways involved, research has focused on the roles of genes, proteins and cellular machinery in the etiology of language impairments, in which people mysteriously fail to develop normal skills despite adequate linguistic input and opportunity [3]. There is a diverse array of these language-related disorders, which usually appear in early childhood and often persist into later life, and they are common enough to have a major impact on modern society. Language problems are frequently observed co-occurring with other developmental disorders, such as autism and epilepsy [4, 5]., Prior to the advent of molecular studies of language disorders, the importance of the genome was already evident from epidemiological analyses. These disorders typically cluster in families [6–9] and monozygotic twins display substantially higher rates of concordance than dizygotic twins [10–12]. Clearly, acquisition of fluent spoken language is also influenced by the environment and its interaction with our genes. However, beyond the obvious effects of impoverished language input (for example, due to hearing problems) there is little known regarding specific environmental risk factors that may disturb linguistic development [13]., Initial clues to the molecular bases of speech and language impairments came from low-density linkage screens [14], followed by targeted association studies of particular chromosome regions and/or focused mutation screens of candidate genes [15]. In addition, studies of chromosomal abnormalities are contributing to our understanding of such disorders, and genome-wide association scans using hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are underway in several cohorts. However, it is evident that the future of gene discovery in language-related traits, as for many other complex phenotypes, lies in large-scale DNA sequencing of entire human genomes., Traditional sequencing methods are slow, laborious and expensive; the original human genome sequencing project cost more than US$3 billion and took more than a decade to finish [16]. Dramatic technological advances have transformed the ability to analyze our genetic makeup at single nucleotide resolution and commercialization of these 'next-generation' platforms is growing fast. At the time of writing, a human genome can be entirely sequenced in a matter of days for only a few thousand dollars, and costs continue to fall at a remarkable rate. Nevertheless, excitement over the enormous potential of the new technologies must be tempered by acknowledging the associated analytical challenges. Already, our capacity to rapidly generate large swathes of sequence data from many individuals outstrips our capacity to infer the underlying biology of a trait using such information., Here, we begin by summarizing approaches previously applied to identify and study the first genes implicated in speech and language disorders (Table 1). We go on to discuss the promise of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for uncovering the key genomic changes that affect our speech and language abilities, not only in relevant disorders, but also in the general population. We argue that it is essential to be able to assess the functional significance of identified variants if we are to understand their biological impact and elucidate their contributions to the human traits of interest. The success of such efforts will depend on synergies between diverse research techniques, including bioinformatics and experimental analyses using model systems, as well as integration of human genome sequences and functional gene network datasets (Figure 1).Table 1

                        Neurogenomics of speech and language disorders. Next-generation sequencing will yield large datasets of genomic variants with potential relevance for speech and language. Identification of key variants is critically dependent on multidisciplinary studies of function in cell lines, animal models and humans, along with integration of data on neurogenetic networks, as detailed in the text.

                    , While it is clear that exciting progress has been made, many of the genetic risk factors underlying speech and language disorders and/or normal linguistic variation remain to be discovered. At the time of writing, no study had yet reported the use of NGS methodologies to specifically investigate language-related traits. However, the advent of NGS has transformed the identification of genetic variants in other important neurodevelopmental phenotypes that co-occur with language deficits, such as ID and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Thus far, most such research has focused on sequencing protein-coding regions of the genome (the exome) to detect de novo variants in rare and common forms of these disorders [58–60]. Since de novo mutations have highly deleterious effects and are subject to strong negative selection, it is hypothesized that they might be important explanations of sporadic occurrences of disorder., Whole-exome sequencing first proved effective in detecting causal de novo variants in rare reproductively lethal neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Kabuki syndrome [61], Bohring-Opitz syndrome [62] and KBG syndrome [63]. The study that pioneered this approach assessed 13 cases of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, which is characterized by severe ID and typical facial features, and revealed de novo gain-of-function mutations independently occurring in a single gene, SETBP1 [64]. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of SETBP1 has been identified in some cases of expressive speech impairment [65]. SETBP1 encodes a widely expressed nuclear protein that interacts with SET, an oncogene involved in DNA replication. Recent studies have shown that SET binding protein 1 (SETBP1) also includes three highly conserved AT-hooks (motifs that bind AT-rich DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner) and that it can act as a transcription factor, directly activating targets such as Hoxa9 and Hoxa10 [66]. Functional links between SETBP1 and brain development have yet to be explored., NGS techniques are also shedding light on the roles of de novo changes in common non-syndromic disorders [59]. A pilot study of whole-exome sequencing in sporadic cases of non-syndromic ID and their parents (parent-child trios) reported nine non-synonymous de novo mutations in different genes in seven of ten probands [67]. Since then, multiple investigations have employed similar approaches to screen trios or quads (trio plus unaffected siblings), including four large-scale whole-exome sequencing efforts across about 1,000 ASD families [68–72] (reviewed by Buxbaum et al. [60]). One conclusion of this work was that the rate of de novo mutations was higher in ASD probands than controls, and it pointed to six genes of particular interest that had recurrent loss-of-function mutations., A major advantage of focusing on de novo mutations is that it dramatically reduces the search space for potential causative variants; it is estimated that an average of approximately one de novo coding variant arises per genome per generation [59]. Interpretation of NGS data becomes more difficult when the search criteria are broadened to encompass all potential etiological coding variants that a proband carries, and it is even more challenging if one also considers non-exonic variations throughout the entire genome. It is not currently known if the genetic architecture underlying specific speech and language disorders includes a significant role for de novo mutations. Thus, it will be important to develop alternative study designs and analytic strategies (for example, Yu et al. [73] and Lim et al. [74]) for pinpointing causative mutations in NGS data from cases and families with language impairments., In the near future, NGS methods will become standard tools in molecular studies of speech and language disorders. As noted above, gene discovery strategies will need to move beyond the de novo paradigms that have been so successful for ID and ASD. Researchers will be faced with the major challenge of discerning which of the many plausibly causal variants carried by each affected person are physiologically relevant to their speech and/or language impairments. Fortunately, distinct fields combining computational and experimental methods can help ascertain the biological roles of detected variants and ultimately highlight genes important for our unique capacity for spoken language., When focusing on protein-coding sequences, after initial filtering of identified variants from NGS data, it is possible to use predictive algorithms such as SIFT [75] and PolyPhen2 [76] to flag the most promising mutations for subsequent analyses. Computational methods such as these use known information on protein sequence and evolutionary history to rank them as benign, possibly damaging or probably damaging. Nonetheless, as cellular pathways harbor some degree of redundancy, not all loss-of-function mutations will contribute to a given disorder and such predictions should be treated with caution. For example, sequencing of FOXP2 in a cohort of CAS/DVD cases revealed a non-synonymous substitution near the N-terminus of the protein (Q17L) in one of the probands [24], a variant that is predicted to be damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2. However, follow-up functional experiments of the Q17L substitution using cell models did not find adverse effects on protein characteristics, in contrast to observations for other proband mutations [77]. Together with the fact that the Q17L proband has an affected sibling who does not carry the substitution, it seems unlikely that this particular change is etiological. Thus, although bioinformatic approaches help narrow down the list of variants from ongoing high-throughput genetic screens of speech and language phenotypes, experimental analyses in model systems are often crucial for determining causality, as well as offering deeper insights into mechanisms., The value of functional approaches is particularly apparent from studies of how FOXP2 mutations lead to speech and language disorder [22]. FOXP2 encodes a forkhead-box transcription factor. Following homo- or hetero-dimerization with other forkhead box P (FOXP) family members [78], the protein binds DNA and represses transcription of its target genes [79]. Human neuron-like cells have been used to assess two different mutant FOXP2 proteins that co-segregate with disorder in CAS/DVD families: pFOXP2.R553H [17] and pFOXP2.R328X [24]. The functional assays demonstrated that these mutations severely disrupt nuclear localization, DNA-binding ability and transactivation potential of the protein [77]. Investigations into downstream targets of FOXP2 highlighted several neuronal pathways that it regulates. Independent high-throughput studies of promoter occupancy in cells and human fetal brain reported that FOXP2 directly regulates genes involved in neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity and axon guidance [80, 81]. More recently, following genome-wide analyses of neural targets in vivo in mouse models, it has been shown that Foxp2 mutations can alter neurite outgrowth and branching in primary neurons [82]., A subset of FOXP2 targets are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders that often co-occur with language deficits, such as the sushi repeat-containing protein X-linked 2 (SRPX2)-plasminogen activator receptor, urokinase-type (uPAR) complex in epilepsy and speech apraxia [83], DISC1 in schizophrenia [84] and MET in ASD [85]. The most rigorously studied FOXP2 target is CNTNAP2, encoding contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), a transmembrane scaffolding protein that clusters K+ channels in myelinated axons [86]. CASPR2 is a member of the neurexin superfamily and, in addition to its role in mature neurons, it has been implicated in neuronal migration, dendritic arborization and spine development [87]. Homozygous loss-of-function CNTNAP2 mutations cause infant-onset epilepsy, learning deficits and language regression [88]. FOXP2 binds directly within the first intron of CNTNAP2 and is able to downregulate its expression [44]. Association analyses of quantitative phenotype data in 184 small SLI families identified a cluster of common intronic SNPs in CNTNAP2 that correlated significantly with reduced performance on linguistic tests, most strongly for the non-word repetition endophenotype [44]. The identity of the precise functional variant(s) in this region is not yet determined, but it is hypothesized that they affect the way that CNTNAP2 is regulated. Rare and common CNTNAP2 variants have also been implicated independently in ASDs [89–91], consistent with prior hypotheses that SLI and ASDs may involve some degree of shared genetic etiology. Beyond SLI, ASD and epilepsy, contributions of CNTNAP2 have been suggested for a range of other neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including schizophrenia [92], selective mutism [93] and Tourette syndrome [94]., A recent study of sporadic ASD demonstrates how the combination of NGS screens with functional experiments can shed light on language-related gene networks [68]. Whole-exome sequencing of parent-child trios identified a de novo frameshift mutation in an ASD proband, introducing a premature stop codon in FOXP1 [68]. The child was severely affected, with regression and language delays. FOXP1 is the most closely related gene to FOXP2 in the human genome and they can act synergistically to regulate shared targets in regions of co-expression [78, 95, 96]. Remarkably, the proband with the FOXP1 mutation also carried an extremely rare CNTNAP2 missense variant, inherited from his unaffected mother [68]. In cell-based functional analyses, the aberrant FOXP1 protein mislocalized to the cytoplasm and lost its transcriptional repressor properties; expression of the mutant FOXP1 isoform in cells elevated CNTNAP2 levels, unlike wild-type FOXP1 [68]. These data were consistent with a two-hit mechanism in which abnormal FOXP1 results in higher CNTNAP2 levels, amplifying any potentially deleterious effects of the missense CNTNAP2 variant of the proband [68]. Similar findings regarding multiple-hit mechanisms have emerged from independent studies of ASDs and other neurodevelopmental syndromes (for example, Leblond et al. [97]), suggesting that this may be an important model for genetic etiology of such disorders [98]., Previous screening of 49 children diagnosed with CAS/DVD did not detect any obviously etiological FOXP1 mutations [99]. However, studies of patients with mild to moderate ID and language impairment have detected rare de novo deletions and a nonsense FOXP1 variant [100, 101]. High-throughput sequencing of balanced chromosomal abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders identified disruptions at the FOXP1 locus [102]., There has been little reported to date on functional analyses of other genes (such as ATP2C2 and CMIP) associated with speech and language disorders, in part because no protein-coding variants have been pinpointed. As noted above, some cases of persistent stuttering carry coding variants in genes (GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA) involved in lysosomal targeting of hydrolase enzymes. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations of this pathway cause mucolipidosis disorders, which involve severe abnormalities affecting multiple systems, including skeletal, respiratory and cardiovascular tissues. Cell-based assays were recently used to analyze Mannose 6-phosphate-uncovering enzyme variants found in people who stutter, and were reported to yield incorrect protein folding, decreased enzymatic activity and degradation by the proteasome [103]., It is not always feasible to carry out experimental assessments of putative risk variants. The nature of assessment is highly dependent on the type of gene product; it is difficult to test protein function if there are no known measurable properties. In contrast to NGS technologies, functional experiments typically remain high cost, time-consuming and laborious, and are less amenable for upscaling. Nevertheless, as NGS reveals additional variants potentially implicated in language impairments and other neurodevelopmental traits, we will inevitably need access to high-throughput techniques for simultaneous mutation testing to define disease-causing variants across the genome [104]. Indeed, several multiplex approaches for characterizing the functional effects of genetic variation in proteins [105], mammalian regulatory elements [106, 107] and RNA [108] have recently been developed. More and more emphasis will be placed on possible functional variants that lie outside protein-coding regions. Various efforts are underway to facilitate this transition, most notably the ENCODE project, which aims to characterize all functional elements at a genome-wide scale, including non-coding RNA and cis-regulatory elements [109]. RegulomeDB is of particular interest, as it combines data from the ENCODE project, GEO and published literature into a single, integrated database that can be used to query the functional significance of variants in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome [110]., Beyond establishing causality, functional characterization of candidate risk variants in model organisms may also help highlight pathways implicated in the origins and bases of language. For example, studies of FOXP2 across different species (mouse, bird, human) have given us initial clues into neurogenetic networks facilitating human spoken language [22, 111]. FOXP2 expression is enriched in several brain areas, including the basal ganglia, deep cortical layers, thalamus and cerebellum [112], some of which display subtle structural and functional abnormalities in people carrying FOXP2 mutations [19, 112–114]. From an evolutionary perspective, this is a highly conserved gene with regard to both the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein and the neural sites where it is expressed [95, 115]. These data suggest that ancestral forms of FOXP2 were involved in important aspects of brain development long before the emergence of spoken language. There is evidence that the functions of the gene may have been modified during human evolution ([116]; also see below), but it remains clear that its roles in the human brain are built on evolutionarily ancient pathways [1]., Extensive characterization of rodent models carrying etiological Foxp2 variants indicates roles in synaptic plasticity, motor-skill learning, and processing and integration of auditory information [117–120]. When mice are heterozygous for the mutation that causes speech problems in the human KE family, they display decreased synaptic plasticity in corticostriatal circuits and motor-skill learning deficits [117]. These mouse findings are intriguing given that affected humans have problems learning to master the rapid coordinated orofacial movements underlying speech [121]. In vivo electrophysiology recordings in awake-behaving mice revealed more about the impacts of Foxp2 on corticostriatal circuitry; mice heterozygous for the KE mutation displayed higher basal striatal activity than wild-type controls, and medium spiny neurons showed aberrant negative modulation of their firing rates during motor-skill learning [118]. Separate studies used mouse models to explore whether impairments in auditory processing and auditory-motor integration might also be relevant to FOXP2-related disorders [119, 120]. Mice carrying the KE mutation were reported to have altered auditory brainstem responses to sound, although this finding was not replicated in mice carrying a different mutation associated with speech/language problems in another family [119]. Mice carrying either etiological mutation have deficits in learning to associate auditory stimuli with motor outputs [120]., Songbirds carry their own version of FOXP2, referred to as FoxP2, and it appears to make important contributions to the functions of a striatal nucleus called Area X [122]. In zebra finches, Area X is critical for auditory-guided vocal learning, a process in which young male birds learn their song by imitating an adult tutor. Vocal learning is also a key component of human speech acquisition. FoxP2 mRNA levels in Area X are enriched in young birds during the critical song-learning period [123] and show rapid downregulation when adult birds practice their songs outside the context of courtship [124–126]. Furthermore, selective knockdown of FoxP2 in Area X disrupts the song-learning process [127] and alters dendritic spine density in this region [128]., Functional studies of genes implicated in language-related disorders may also give us entry points into mechanisms involved in language function in the general population. As discussed above, variants of CNTNAP2, a direct target of FOXP2, were associated with linguistic deficits in clinically distinct neurodevelopmental disorders [44, 88, 89, 129–131]. Subsequent studies revealed that CNTNAP2 may contribute to language processing in healthy individuals [132–134]. The cluster of CNTNAP2 SNPs that is associated with language phenotypes in SLI and ASDs has also been reported to correlate with assessments of early language development in general population samples [132]. Neuroimaging genetics studies of common CNTNAP2 SNPs in healthy samples have proposed associations with functional brain measures related to language [133, 134] and with altered structural connectivity patterns [135]. However, imaging genetics of language is a field that is only in its infancy; reports thus far involved small sample sizes with limited power, as well as a substantial multiple-testing burden, and results of different studies have been largely inconsistent. Additional analyses are required to elucidate how FOXP2, CNTNAP2 and other language-related genes influence brain circuits at multiple levels of description - molecular, cellular, structural and functional., The reach of NGS technologies extends well beyond living species. These innovations have allowed molecular anthropologists to reconstruct large portions of nuclear genomes from extinct hominins that co-existed with our ancestors, such as Neanderthals [136] and Denisovans [137]. By comparing modern human sequences to ancient hominin genomes, as well as to our closest extant relatives, chimpanzees, it is possible to identify molecular variants that arose during human evolution, and roughly date them with regard to branches of the primate phylogenetic tree. As for other NGS projects, our capacity to generate large amounts of sequence data exceeds our ability to interpret it. So although scientists have successfully catalogued many of the DNA changes that occurred on our lineage, an extraordinary feat in itself, it is still a major challenge to determine which of these evolutionary events were relevant for the emergence of traits such as speech and language acquisition [1]. Here, success may depend on the integration of findings from evolutionary genomics with data from molecular studies of language-related disorders., The best illustration of this approach comes again from work on the FOXP2 gene, which was targeted for evolutionary investigations, based on its prior link to a severe speech and language disorder. Comparative primate genomics suggests that FOXP2 probably underwent at least two interesting evolutionary events on the lineage that led to modern humans. After splitting from the chimpanzee (several million years ago) there were changes in the coding region of the locus that yielded two amino acid substitutions in the encoded protein [138]. Although these are minor changes outside the known functional domains, when such substitutions are inserted into the endogenous Foxp2 gene of a mouse, they have subtle detectable effects on brain structure and function, including altered connectivity and plasticity of corticostriatal circuits [116]. NGS approaches indicate that these amino acid substitutions are shared by Neanderthals [136] and Denisovans [137]. (It is worth emphasizing here that status of a single gene is not enough to determine whether or not a species can speak.) Researchers went on to identify a number of non-coding variants in intronic regions of FOXP2 that had occurred more recently on the human lineage, after splitting from Neanderthal/Denisovan a few hundred thousand years ago [139]. One of these changes lies in a region that underwent a recent selective sweep, and alters a putative binding site for the POU class 3 homeobox 2 (POU3F2) transcription factor, such that it may have affected regulation of FOXP2 expression; cell-based analyses are consistent with this hypothesis [139]. Thus, just like sequence-based analyses of language-related disorders, evaluation of the biological significance of interesting variants from ancient genomics requires functional studies using model systems., The advent of whole genome NGS means that data generation will no longer be the limiting factor in understanding how genetic factors contribute to mechanisms underlying complex neurodevelopmental traits. Coupling NGS approaches to functional validation in model systems will facilitate network mapping and pathway investigation in speech and language disorders, and ultimately in normal linguistic development."

A previous study [3] combined spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization and conventional cytogenetic techniques to reveal extensive chromosomal aberrations, including hyper-triploid chromosome number and genetic abnormalities (often used as HeLa markers) on 20 chromosomes. Landry et al. [2] have now used deep DNA and RNA sequencing to define the HeLa genome and transcriptome, revealing the true extent of genetic abnormalities at nucleotide resolution. This study establishes a reference sequence for the HeLa genome, along with genetic variations identified in the cell line: valuable resources for the continued use of HeLa cells in biomedical research., In the study [2], the authors report a plethora of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels and copy-number changes. Figure 1 shows a genome-wide view of the genomic changes reported in the HeLa genome. Impressively, the authors report, with nucleotide resolution, 2,893 structural variants dominated by large deletion events. In addition, a total of approximately 4.5 million SNVs and 0.5 million indels were identified, the vast majority of which were common variants that had already been reported in the dbSNP database and the 1000 Genomes Project. Common SNVs that are potentially damaging were found in 1,231 genes. Among the 336,006 HeLa-specific SNVs, just 233 would cause amino acid changes, with the function of only 66 proteins predicted to be adversely affected. The potential contributions of these common and specific changes to the phenotypes of the cells, or to the tumor from which they were derived, are unclear. As the authors note, without normal tissue and tumor cells from Henrietta Lacks, which are unavailable, it is not possible to know whether these HeLa-specific variants are unique to the donor's genome, or the donor's cancer, or are a byproduct of 60 years of propagation in culture [2].
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Circos plot illustrating the genomic features of the HeLa genome. From outside to inside, the tracks represent: read depth (100 kb binned coverage); copy number (color gradient from light green for one copy to dark red for more than six copies); zygosity (pink, heterozygous; purple, homozygous); SNV density (1 Mb binned SNV count; darker blue for greater density); and translocation calls (colored arcs; light blue, from paired-end sequencing data; light green, from mate pair data; orange, from both datasets). Reproduced, with permission, from [2].
                    , Finally, the authors [2] find extensive copy-number heterogeneity, with most loci found in three or more copies, which is consistent with previous studies reporting a 3n+ chromosome state [3]. Surprisingly, although less than 1% of the HeLa genome is present at a copy number of one, there are large stretches of homozygosity non-uniformly distributed in the HeLa genome. The authors partitioned the genome into 100 kb bins and found that 23% of these bins were composed of mostly homozygous SNVs (purple in Figure 1). In contrast, they did not find any 100 kb bins of homozygosity in HapMap samples, which are more representative of normal human variation. Comparisons of copy numbers with transcriptome data, also generated in the study [2], indicated a correlation between copy number and expression level, suggesting that dosage compensation does not occur at a global scale in HeLa cells. Among the more highly expressed genes were those enriched for functions such as proliferation, transcription, and DNA repair - arguably valuable assets for life in culture or in a tumor., A subset of cervical cancers is caused by HPV infection. The authors identified a known insertion of HPV18 on chromosome 8, consistent with previous studies, but also documented nine additional putative viral integration sites [2]. Remarkably, they also found evidence that four of the HeLa chromosomes had been shattered into pieces, with many of the fragments reassembled randomly into highly rearranged chromosomes. This recently described phenomenon, known as chromothripsis, has been found to be associated with 2 to 3% of all cancers [4]. In HeLa cells, evidence of chromothripsis was most pronounced in chromosome 11, which is a hotspot for loss of heterozygosity associated with cervical cancer, the cancer that killed Henrietta Lacks. Whole-genome sequencing was instrumental in revealing the abnormalities of the shattered chromosome 11. In a previous study that used cytogenetic techniques, it was reported that the rearrangement of chromosome 11 segments could not be fully resolved [3]., Human cell lines are important models for studying biological function and disease, but to maximize insight from model cell lines, it is critical to understand the genomic architecture of these cells. HeLa cells are particularly abnormal compared with non-cancer human cell lines, as well as compared with the human reference sequence. At the same time, most genomic studies in HeLa cells have used the human reference sequence. The authors highlight the critical importance of this in a case study in which they re-evaluate small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed for a large-scale screen in HeLa cells. Some of the siRNAs designed to target the human reference sequences failed to elicit effects in HeLa cells because they did not match the sequence of the HeLa cell genome. This shows the importance of validating targets of siRNAs and other reagents designed against a specific genomic sequence. It is equally important to understand the transcriptional (and ultimately the proteomic) profile of model systems to confirm expected properties before initiating a new study. High-throughput sequencing offers a fast and cost-effective way to characterize cell lines, with the price of exome and transcriptome sequencing already below $1,000 and dropping. For some popular cell lines, these data are already available in NCBI's Sequence Read Archive and other public repositories. The use of high-throughput sequencing data to characterize cell lines is timely, not just because of cost, but also because methods have matured for detecting SNVs, indels and more complex variants in the genome [5, 6]. The authors of the HeLa study [2] are working toward making available not only the HeLa reference sequence, but also all the read data from whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing., In addition to characterizing cell lines, it is just as important to confirm the identity of the lines. Misidentification of cell lines, sometimes because of contamination from other cells, is a continuing concern [7]. Historically, cell lines have been identified using short tandem repeat (STR) markers that can be assayed with commercial kits, or from validated marker lists provided by sample repositories such as the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). In the HeLa study [2], for example, the authors reported that they first confirmed the identity of their HeLa cells using 16 STRs, of which nine were promoted as standards by the ATCC and the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ). They reported that more than 80% of the markers matched, the gold standard set by the ATCC for STR-based cell line identification. In the era of high-throughput sequencing, even exome sequencing provides sufficient data from which a multitude of additional markers can be established. Improved methods for accurately identifying STR genotypes from high-throughput sequencing data [8] make STR marker identification eminently feasible and open up the possibility of constructing databases with thousands of STRs that uniquely distinguish one cell line from another., Sequencing the genome and transcriptome of the HeLa cell line is an important milestone in biomedical research. For more than 60 years, scientists have studied many biological processes in HeLa cells, publishing some 60,000 papers along the way. The detailed studies by Steinmetz and his colleagues [2] will undoubtedly foster even more productive research using HeLa cells. By documenting just how aberrant HeLa genomes are, however, they also heighten our awareness of exactly what it means to select a cell line for a particular study, and they raise the bar for making such decisions."

Energy stress blocks cell growth and proliferation, a critical response for survival under extreme conditions. Excessive oncogenic stress leads to p53 activation and the induction of senescence, an irreversible state of cell-cycle arrest and a critical component in the suppression of tumorigenesis. Nutrient-sensing and mitogenic cues converge on a major signaling node, which regulates the activity of the mTOR kinase. Although transcriptional responses to energy and oncogenic stresses have been examined by many gene-expression experiments, a global exploration of the modulation of mRNA translation in response to these conditions is lacking., We combine RNA sequencing and ribosomal profiling analyses to systematically delineate modes of transcriptional and translational regulation induced in response to conditions of limited energy, oncogenic stress and cellular transformation. We detect a key role for mTOR and p53 in these distinct physiological states, and provide the first genome-wide demonstration that p53 activation results in mTOR inhibition and a consequent global repression of protein translation. We confirm the role of the direct p53 target genes Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 in this response, as part of the broad modulation of gene expression induced by p53 activation., We delineate a bimodal tumor-suppressive regulatory program activated by p53, in which cell-cycle arrest is imposed mainly at the transcriptional level, whereas cell growth inhibition is enforced by global repression of the translation machinery.","cell proliferation and growth, mTOR, p53 signaling, ribosome profiling, senescence, translation regulation","Cell growth (increase in cell mass) and proliferation (increase in cell number) are tightly coupled to ensure that appropriately sized daughter cells are produced after mitosis. In single-cell eukaryotes such as yeast, cell growth and proliferation are mainly regulated by nutrient-sensing pathways. In multicellular organisms, these two processes are also regulated by growth and mitogenic signals, which are integrated with the nutrient-sensing pathways. These nutrient-sensing and mitogenic signals converge on a critical node, which regulates the activity of the highly conserved mTOR kinase [1]. Disregulated cell growth and proliferation are two fundamental aspects of tumorigenesis. It is therefore not surprising that pivotal proto-oncogenes (for example, RAS, PI3K and Akt) and tumor-suppressor genes (for example, PTEN, NF1 and LKB1) directly regulate the activity of the mTOR pathway, and that elevated mTOR signaling has been detected in a large proportion of human cancers [2, 3]. Consequently, mTOR has emerged as a key target for the treatment of cancer and a number of mTOR inhibitors are being examined by clinical trials [4, 5]., A major safeguarding role against cancer development is played by the p53 tumor suppressor [6, 7]. Excessive oncogenic signaling ('oncogenic stress') leads to the activation of p53 and to the induction of senescence, an irreversible state of cell-cycle arrest [8, 9]. Abrogation of the p53 pathway leads to senescence-bypass and progression to neoplastic transformation [10]. The coupling of cell proliferation and growth signals suggests a role for p53 in controlling cellular growth. However, while the role of p53 in arresting cell proliferation is very well established, its role in arresting cell growth is much less documented. Recent reports described cross-talks between p53 and mTOR pathways [11, 12]., Until recently, systems-level analysis of biological processes was mainly limited to the transcriptomic layer. For almost two decades now, gene-expression microarrays have enabled large-scale exploration of transcriptional modulation under various physiological conditions and in response to numerous stresses. By contrast, systematic exploration of the modulation of mRNA translation significantly lagged behind due to the lack of a genomic technique that probes this regulatory layer. Very recently, a deep-sequencing based technique called ribosome profiling, or Ribo-Seq [13, 14], was developed. It allows, for the first time, the study - on a truly global scale - of changes in rates of protein translation (Figure S1A in Additional file 1)., In this study we combined RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq analyses to systematically explore modes of transcriptional and translational control in conditions of limited nutrients (quiescence), oncogenic stress (senescence) and cellular neoplastic transformation. Our results detect major patterns of transcriptional and translational responses induced by these stresses and indicate critical roles for mTOR and p53 in their regulation., We explored on a genomic- and transcriptomic scale modulation of mRNA levels and their translation rates in physiological conditions of energy deprivation, oncogenic stress and neoplastic transformation. Two major responses that were activated in response to energy and oncogenic stresses but not in the transformed state were the suppression of cell-cycle genes and the inhibition of translational machinery genes. The former represents attenuation of cell proliferation and the latter attenuation of cell growth. Interestingly, while cell-cycle regulation was observed solely at the transcript level, a two-armed program was induced to attenuate protein translation and thereby suppress cell growth. The ribosomal proteins and key translational factors were repressed exclusively at the level of mRNA translation, while the auxiliary genes encoding for proteins that function in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly were mainly down-regulated at the level of transcript expression (Figure 2). In agreement with our observation, a recent study demonstrated a link between mTOR signaling and the transcriptional regulation of ribosome biogenesis genes [23]., Inhibition of the translational machinery is a critical response in the face of stress because protein biosynthesis is the most energy-demanding process in the cell. mTOR is a master regulator of protein synthesis [1], and its inhibition results in global translational repression of the translational machinery (Figure S3 in Additional file 1; [18]). The 5′-UTRs of the translationally repressed transcripts were significantly enriched for the 5′-TOP motif that was demonstrated to control their TE. The mechanisms by which the translation of 5′-TOP transcripts is regulated have remained elusive for a long time and are still under intensive investigation. Recently, Damgaard et al. [24] reported that the TIA-1 and TIAR RNA-binding proteins are assembled on the 5′-end of 5′-TOP transcripts in response to serum starvation and that this association, which was dependent on inactivation of the mTOR pathway, blocks the translation of the target transcripts at the initiation step. Thoreen et al. [25], however, did not find evidence for the involvement of TIA-1 or TIAR in the regulation of 5′-TOP transcripts, and alternatively suggested that the translation of 5′-TOP mRNAs is especially dependent on the interaction between eIF4G1 and eIF4E initiation factors, which is inhibited by the 4E-BP proteins (see map in Figure 2B). The translation of 5′-TOP mRNAs is enhanced by mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the 4E-BP inhibitory proteins; in conditions of stress, when mTOR pathway activity is low, 4E-BP proteins bind eIF4E and interfere with its interaction with eIF4G1, thereby selectively attenuating the TE of 5′-TOP transcripts., Excessive oncogenic signaling activates p53 and induces senescence. Activation of cell-cycle arrest is one of the best characterized tumor-suppressive functions of p53. The observation that both cell-cycle genes and translational machinery transcripts were strongly repressed in senescence (at the transcriptional and translational layers, respectively), but not in the transformed state in which p53 is knocked-down, suggested that p53 activation also strongly inhibits cell growth. We tested this hypothesis by examining the transcriptional and translational responses induced by p53 activation following nutlin-3a treatment. In line with our expectation, p53 activation resulted in a striking translational repression of the translational machinery (Figure 3B). Global translation repression of the translational machinery is a hallmark of mTOR inhibition. This strongly suggests that the repression of the translational machinery upon p53 activation is mediated by inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Supporting this conclusion, we have demonstrated that p53 induction inhibits the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, a major mTOR target protein. Budanov and Karin [11] reported that two direct targets of p53, Sestrin1 and Sestrin2, mediate p53 inhibition of the mTOR pathway by activating AMP-responsive protein kinase, which is also the main regulator that attenuates mTOR signaling in response to energy stress (see map in Figure 2B). Notably, both Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 were strongly induced in our dataset in response to nutlin-3a treatment, and their inhibition allowed the accumulation of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in the presence of high p53 levels (Figure 4A). Furthermore, knocking-down the Sestrin genes significantly attenuated the translational repression of the translation machinery in response to p53 activation (Figure 4C). Taken together, our results elucidate, for the first time on a global scale, the extensive impact that p53 activation has on the translation machinery, and demonstrate the role of Sestrin1 and 2 in inhibiting mTOR activity upon p53 activation., Senescence is usually described as a barrier to tumor development. Recently, Blagosklonny and his colleagues reported that p53 activation paradoxically repressed senescence and converted it into quiescence [26]. A series of follow-up studies demonstrated that the choice between p53-induced senescence and quiescence is determined by the activity of the mTOR pathway, where low mTOR activity results in quiescence and higher activity in senescence [27–31]. Accordingly, Blagosklonny recently sharpened the characterization of the senescent phenotype as a state in which contradicting excessive growth stimulatory and cell-cycle arrest signals coexist in the cell. It is the cell-cycle arrest signals induced by p53 that pose the barrier to tumorigenesis, and not the senescent state per se [32]. Our results support this model, and delineate the bimodal regulatory program induced by p53 to enforce concomitant block of both cell proliferation and growth as two coordinated responses that suppress neoplastic transformation., Our understanding of control mechanisms that translationally co-regulate target mRNAs is scanty and very limited compared to our knowledge on cis-regulatory promoter elements that dictate transcriptional co-regulation of their target genes. The 5′-TOP motif provides one glaring example of a translational co-regulation mechanism. The advent of the Ribo-Seq technique holds great promise for systematic discovery of many more such mechanisms in the coming years, similar to the major advance in the discovery of promoter regulatory elements that followed the maturation of expression arrays more than a decade ago., We delineated a bimodal tumor-suppressive regulatory program activated by p53, in which cell-cycle arrest is imposed mainly at the transcriptional level, whereas cell growth inhibition is enforced by global repression of the translation machinery."

In this study, we report a novel single-cell RNA-seq method called Quartz-Seq that has a simpler protocol and higher reproducibility and sensitivity than existing methods. We show that single-cell Quartz-Seq can quantitatively detect various kinds of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity, and can detect different cell types and different cell-cycle phases of a single cell type. Moreover, this method can comprehensively reveal gene-expression heterogeneity between single cells of the same cell type in the same cell-cycle phase., Non-genetic cellular heterogeneity at the mRNA and protein levels has been observed within cell populations in diverse developmental processes and physiological conditions [1–4]. However, the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of this cellular heterogeneity and its changes in response to perturbations has been extremely challenging. Recently, several researchers reported quantification of gene-expression heterogeneity within genetically identical cell populations, and elucidation of its biological roles and underlying mechanisms [5–8]. Although gene-expression heterogeneities have been quantitatively measured for several target genes using single-molecule imaging or single-cell quantitative (q)PCR, comprehensive studies on the quantification of gene-expression heterogeneity are limited [9] and thus further work is required. Because global gene-expression heterogeneity may provide biological information (for example, on cell fate, culture environment, and drug response), the question of how to comprehensively and quantitatively detect the heterogeneity of mRNA expression in single cells and how to extract biological information from those data remains to be addressed., Single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis has been shown to be an effective approach for the comprehensive quantification of gene-expression heterogeneity that reflects the cellular heterogeneity at the single-cell level [10, 11]. To understand the biological roles and underlying mechanisms of such heterogeneity, an ideal single-cell transcriptome analysis method would provide a simple, highly reproducible, and sensitive method for measuring the gene-expression heterogeneity of cell populations. In addition, this method should be able to distinguish clearly the gene-expression heterogeneity from experimental errors., Single-cell transcriptome analyses, which can be achieved through the use of various platforms, such as microarrays, massively parallel sequencers and bead arrays [12–17], are able to identify cell-type markers and/or rare cell types in tissues. These platforms require nanogram quantities of DNA as the starting material. However, a typical single cell has approximately 10 pg of total RNA and often contains only 0.1 pg of polyadenylated RNA, hence, o obtain the amount of DNA starting material that is required by these platforms, it is necessary to perform whole-transcript amplification (WTA)., Previous WTA methods for single cells fall into two categories, based on the modifications that are introduced into the first-strand cDNAs in the PCR-based methods. One approach is based on the poly-A tailing reaction, and the other on the template-switching reaction. In principle, the goal of poly-A tailing is to obtain both full-length first-strand cDNAs and truncated cDNAs. The aim of template switching is to obtain first-strand cDNAs that have reached the 5' ends of the RNA templates. These modified cDNAs are amplifiable by subsequent PCR enrichment methods., Kurimoto et al. reported a quantitative WTA method based on the poly-A-tailing reaction for single-cell microarrays [12]. They used this single-cell transcriptome analysis, and published initial validation data for technical replicates, each of which required 10 pg of total RNA. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for the reproducibility of this method using 10 pg of total RNA per reaction was approximately 0.85 [12]. Using a method similar to the one used by Kurimoto et al., Tang et al. performed single-cell RNA-seq. When they applied their method to a single mouse oocyte (around 1 ng of total RNA), these researchers were able to detect a larger number of genes than could be identified using a microarray approach [13]. However, these methods are complicated because they require multiple PCR tubes for a single cell, and gel purification is required for the removal of unexpected byproducts [18, 19]. Furthermore, detailed quantitative analysis of the performance of the Tang et al. single-cell RNA-seq method, including its reproducibility and sensitivity, has not been analyzed., Two single-cell RNA-seq methods based on the template-switching reaction have been reported. Islam et al. described a method called single-cell tagged reverse transcription sequencing (STRT-seq), which is a highly multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq method that can detect the restricted 5' ends of mRNAs [14]. Ramsköld et al. developed Smart-Seq (the WTA part of Smart-Seq is now marketed as SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Illumina Sequencing, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), which exhibits a greater read coverage across transcripts than previously developed methods [16]. The PCCs for the reproducibility of the methods using 10 pg of total RNA were both approximately 0.7. Recently, Hashimshony et al. described CEL-Seq (Cell Expression by Linear amplification and Sequencing), which is an in vitro transcription (IVT)-based method but not a PCR-based method. CEL-Seq is a highly multiplexed single-cell RNA-seq method that can detect the 3' end of mRNA [17]. CEL-Seq was shown to detect significantly more genes in single mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells compared with STRT-Seq. The performance of these reported methods is sufficient for the identification of cell-type markers. However, their specifications for WTA did not validate whether the methods are sufficient to quantitatively assess the global gene-expression heterogeneity that is indicative of cellular heterogeneity. Because the PCC for reproducibility is greater than 0.95 for conventional non-WTA RNA-seq, it would be desirable to improve the reproducibility and sensitivity of single-cell RNA-seq to a greater degree than is possible with existing methods., To comprehensively and quantitatively detect gene-expression heterogeneity, we have developed a simple and highly quantitative single-cell RNA-seq approach that we term Quartz-Seq. In this study, we identified some defective factors that allowed us to simplify the experimental procedures and improve the quantitative performance. In particular, to maintain the simplicity and enhance the quantitative performance of WTA, we improved three crucial aspects: 1) we achieved robust suppression of byproduct synthesis; 2) we identified a robust PCR enzyme that allows the use of a single-tube reaction; and 3) we determined the optimal conditions of reverse transcription (RT) and second-strand synthesis for the capturing mRNA and the first-strand cDNA. We also performed a quantitative comparison between our method and previously developed methods using 10 pg of total RNA as the starting material the reproducibility and sensitivity of the Quartz-Seq method was better than those of the other methods., When used in the global expression analysis of real single cells, the single-cell Quartz-Seq approach successfully detected gene expression heterogeneity even between cells of the same cell type and in the same cell-cycle phase. This observed gene-expression heterogeneity was found to be highly reproducible in two independent experiments, and could be distinguished from experimental errors, which were measured through technical replicates of pooled samples. We also found that single-cell Quartz-Seq was able to discriminate more easily between different cell types and/or between different cell-cycle phases. Therefore, single-cell Quartz-Seq is a useful method for the comprehensive identification and quantitative assessment of cellular heterogeneity., In this study, we established a novel WTA method that is optimized for single-cell RNA-seq, and detects gene-expression heterogeneity between individual cells. This WTA method for single-cell Quartz-Seq is substantially easier to perform than other previously developed methods that are based on the poly-A-tailing reaction [18, 19] (see Additional file 1, Figure S1). For example, the Kurimoto et al. method requires approximately 17 PCR tubes and 11 reaction steps for a single cell [18], whereas the single-cell Quartz-Seq amplification, requires only 1 PCR tube and 6 reaction steps per single cell; all of the steps are completed in a single PCR tube without any purification. These improvements, which drastically simplify the single-cell Quartz-Seq method, will be useful for high-throughput production of single-cell preparations., In addition to its simplicity, the single-cell Quartz-Seq method is highly quantitative (Figure 2). We validated the performance of single-cell Quartz-Seq using 10 pg samples of purified total RNA prepared from pooled cell populations, and found that the quantitative performance of single-cell Quartz-Seq was better than that of previously developed single-cell methods (Figure 3). Moreover, Quartz-Seq was useful for the analysis of cell subpopulations (50 cells containing 300 to 350 pg of total RNA) with highly quantitative performance (R = 0.99; see Additional file 1, Figure S17)., Any method based on PCR amplification will have difficulty amplifying transcripts with an extremely high GC content, and thus we would expect these to be under-represented in the Quartz-Seq. We performed a detailed comparison of technical noise between different polymerases, and found that Quartz-Seq is more robust against high GC content when MightyAmp DNA polymerase is used for amplification of GC-rich sequences compared with Ex Taq DNA polymerase., In the analysis of cDNA lengths in each method, we found that the unamplified isoforms from Quartz-Seq had a shorter cDNA length (mean 1,684.0 bp) than the amplified isoforms (mean 2558.6 bp). This seems counterintuitive but can be explained by the principle of massively parallel sequencing with WTA, in which a longer cDNA generates more reads and therefore can be detected more sensitively than a shorter cDNA (see Additional file 1, Figure S11d). The unamplified isoforms from Quartz-Seq also had a shorter cDNA length (mean 1,684.0 bp) compared with the mean length of all of the Ensembl Mouse Transcripts (mean 1,817 bp). The unamplified isoforms from Quartz-Seq had a significantly shorter cDNA length (mean 1,684.0 bp) than those from Smart-Seq (mean 2,382.0 bp), suggesting that Quartz-Seq is more robust against a shorter cDNA length. We also found that Smart-Seq was unable to amplify 3,924 ± 124.5 isoforms, whereas the number of isoforms that could not be amplified by Quartz-Seq was only 1,614 ± 88.9., As a result of its higher reproducibility and sensitivity, single-cell Quartz-Seq can distinguish not only different cell types but also different cell-cycle phases of the same cell type. In addition, this method can also comprehensively detect gene-expression fluctuations within the same cell type and cell-cycle phase; these fluctuations were highly reproducible in two independent experiments (Figure 5a,c) and were distinguished from experimental errors measured from technical replicates of pooled samples (Figure 5b). Therefore, our method is capable of comprehensively and quantitatively revealing gene-expression fluctuations. Such fluctuations can be generated by both the intrinsic stochastic nature of gene expression and the extrinsic environmental differences between cells [5–8]. In fact, it has been reported that individual cells in a population of ES cells exhibit fluctuations in both mRNA and protein expression under the same culture conditions (for example, as reported for Nanog, Zfp42 Whsc2, Rhox9, and Zscan4) that might be associated with different cellular phenotypes [1, 23–25]. Hence, the single-cell Quartz-Seq approach should be useful for the analysis of the roles and mechanisms of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity., Single-cell Quartz-Seq is a simplified protocol compared with previously established methods based on the poly-A-tailing reaction. All of the steps are completed in a single PCR tube without any purification. The reproducibility and sensitivity of Quartz-Seq were higher than those of other single-cell RNA-seq methods. Use of Quartz-Seq in technical replicates with 10 pg each of total RNA produced a PCC of approximately 0.93, whereas the reproducibility of previous methods is approximately 0.7. To evaluate the sensitivity of Quartz-Seq, we compared the performance of conventional RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq methods with 10 pg total RNA and found the PCC to be approximately 0.88 in Quartz-Seq compared with approximately 0.7 in other methods. When used in the global expression analysis of real single cells, the single-cell Quartz-Seq approach successfully detected gene-expression heterogeneity even between cells of the same cell type and/or between different cell-cycle phases. This observed gene-expression heterogeneity was found to be highly reproducible in two independent experiments, and could be distinguished from experimental errors, which were measured using technical replicates of pooled samples. Therefore, single-cell Quartz-Seq is a useful method for the comprehensive identification and quantitative assessment of cellular heterogeneity."

Announcements of technological breakthroughs - a hallmark of previous AGBT meetings - were markedly absent, but existing technologies continued to improve following the now expected exponential curve. Although applications ranged widely, there was a strong emphasis on clinical diagnosis., With the HiSeq and the MiSeq platforms, Illumina is now firmly established as the most widely used sequencing technology. Geoff Smith (Illumina, USA) announced the recent acquisition of Moleculo, a new protocol extending contiguous sequence length. Jonathan Rothberg (Life Technologies, USA) reported on the 100-fold increases in sequencing output in just two years on the Ion Torrent and Proton platforms, stating they are 'not seeing the end of capacity' for the semiconductor-based technology. In addition, Jonas Korlach (Pacific Biosciences, USA) presented impressive results on particularly difficult sequences and showed that pathogen genomes could be quickly finished using the SMRT platform's long reads. On the other hand, James Knight (Roche, USA) discussed the detailed sequencing of RP11 - the individual who contributed 70% of the reference genome - closing many reference gaps and leading to the identification of reference errors., The vast accumulation of genetic data, the use of combinations of sequencing technologies and a variety of algorithmic improvements have led to the identification of certain limitations and recurring error types of current technologies. Mark DePristo (Broad Institute, USA) described the observation of 'fake SNPs' that arise from misassembling reads around short gaps, and discussed how these were resolved using the HaplotypeCaller software. He also emphasized that PCR amplification in the library preparation step can be a major source of error. Meanwhile, Jay Shendure (University of Washington, USA) described an updated version of molecular inversion probes that is highly multiplexed and rebalanced for solving problems caused by extremes in GC content; he also reported finding many de novo mutations that were missed by exome sequencing. In addition, I reported observing thousands of genomic segments enriched in false-positive findings, based on analysis of hundreds of complete genomes (Gustavo Glusman, Institute for Systems Biology, USA)., Exome sequencing is prevalent: more than 100,000 exomes have now been reported. Several presenters discussed limitations in exome sequencing, and contrasted results with whole genome sequencing (WGS). Stephen Scherer (Hospital for Sick Children, Canada) showed that approximately 13% of exons are absent from exome capture arrays, and that WGS data yield more uniform coverage of the exome. He further reported that 6 out of 56 clinically relevant variants observed in a WGS study of autism would not have been captured by exome sequencing. Interestingly, Malachi Griffith (Washington University School of Medicine, USA) showed examples of short intronic deletions, which are invisible to exome analysis, and demonstrated how these can affect gene expression levels. Michael Talkowski (Harvard Medical School, USA) stressed the difficulty in identifying copy-number variants and aneuploidy from exome data. Overall, it seems there is a clear trend for WGS becoming the ultimate diagnostic tool., The central theme of this year's AGBT was the application of sequencing technologies to clinical needs. Recurring topics of discussion included the need for speed in processing pipelines (from samples to interpretation), validation of results and clinical reporting, particularly for incidental findings., Beyond the clinic, a dizzying diversity of applications was presented. Kjersti Aagaard (Baylor College of Medicine, USA) described revelations of detailed metagenomic sequencing applied to obstetrics: her team found that the composition of the vaginal microbiome shifts during pregnancy, and that the placenta has a nonpathogenic commensal microbiome most similar in composition to that of subgingival plaques. Ross Hardison (Pennsylvania State University, USA) reported enrichment of gene-regulating variants outside coding regions, and modeling gene expression based on integration of epigenetic features, multi-species alignments and transcription factor motif enrichment. Eric Schadt (Pacific Biosciences, USA) highlighted massive copy number variation impact on gene expression levels. Leonid Moroz (University of Florida, USA) studied memory and epigenetic modifications in giant snail neurons, and found massive DNA demethylation in quick response to neurotransmitters. He reported being able to perform sequencing on an expedition ship, simplifying oceanic exploration. Leonard Lipovich (Wayne State University, USA) reported thousands of novel long non-coding RNAs. Chia-Lin Wei (Joint Genome Institute, USA) presented a detailed and riveting connectivity map of chromatin interactions between promoters and enhancers, within and between chromosomes. Finally, Mark Yandell (University of Utah, USA) discussed applying 'pigeonomics' to the same pigeon species that Darwin studied., As attention shifts from sequencing to extracting meaning from the data, there is a proliferation of commercial analytical tools - frequently cloud-based solutions - from companies such as Ingenuity Systems, Agilent, Maverix Biomics, DNAnexus and Omicia., There was a modest crop of novel algorithms for computational analysis of sequence data. Andrew Farrell (Boston College, USA) presented RUFUS, an ingenious algorithm for detecting differences between two samples that requires no reference sequence. RUFUS promises to have many applications, from cancer to RNA editing. Aaron Quinlan (University of Virginia, USA) reported on the development of LUMPY, a probabilistic framework integrating diverse signals for structural variant discovery., Despite the wealth of data described at the meeting, one important issue remains unresolved: though vast numbers of exomes and whole genomes have been obtained, and some progress was reported in databasing and sharing of medical information and treatment outcomes, much work remains to be done to make these data available to the research community."

The aim of this review is to highlight some of the insights into the mechanism underlying type 2 diabetes provided by genetic association studies., Type 2 diabetes is caused by defective insulin secretion in the presence of insulin resistance. It usually occurs in late adulthood and is associated with high body mass index (BMI). Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 200 genetic variants associated with metabolic traits, including 65 loci associated with type 2 diabetes (Figure 1) [1–17]. This number is increasing as larger meta-analyses of GWASs are performed. For most of the variants the precise gene involved and its biological role in type 2 diabetes is unknown. Nevertheless, some genetic variants have provided interesting insights into the links between metabolic traits and disease. We discuss several examples in this review (Table 1).
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Sixty-five loci associated with type 2 diabetes. This figure illustrates effect size, risk mechanism and year of discovery for all 65 loci associated with type 2 diabetes [1–17]. The x axis gives the year that the association was discovered with robust (genome wide) significance. The y axis is the effect size (odds ratio) for type 2 diabetes association. Colors indicate possible disease mechanism. The odds ratios for type 2 diabetes were all obtained from the recent publication by the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium [1].
                    , GWASs have identified 36 variants associated with normal variation in fasting glucose levels [14, 18, 19]. We might have expected these variants to be associated with type 2 diabetes with effect sizes proportional to their effects on fasting glucose in the normal range, but this relationship is not clear. Several genetic variants have proportionally larger effects on fasting or stimulated glucose in the normal range compared with their effects on type 2 diabetes risk, and vice versa [14, 17]. Three variants stand out: those in GCK, MTN1RB and G6PC2, which have the strongest effect on fasting glucose but no effect (G6PC2) or small effects (GCK and MTN1RB) on risk of type 2 diabetes (Figure 2). Arguably the most interesting is the variant at G6PC2. This gene encodes glucose-6-phosphatase that functions in glucose transport and sensing. Variants lying in the intronic region of this gene, but of no obvious function, are associated with fasting glucose and insulin secretion but not type 2 diabetes. The allele associated with increased fasting glucose is also, paradoxically, associated with improved response to an oral glucose challenge [20]. In contrast, TCF7L2 is most strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, but has a relatively limited effect on fasting glucose in the normal range. These findings suggest that there are differences in the genes and mechanisms that influence normal physiological glucose levels compared with the beta cell dysfunction and pathophysiological glucose levels seen in type 2 diabetes.

                    , Genetic studies have revealed that polymorphisms in the MTNR1B gene influence the risk of type 2 diabetes and glucose control in the non-diabetic population. MTNR1B encodes one of two distinct receptors through which melatonin exerts its effect [21]. Melatonin is a circulating hormone that regulates circadian rhythm. The MTNR1B receptor is expressed in human islets [22, 23]. Increased nocturnal levels of melatonin coincide with decreased insulin levels. There is evidence from animal studies that if the central and peripheral circadian rhythms, including the melatonin pathway, are disrupted, the risk of metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes is increased [24, 25]. The association between MTNR1B genetic variation and glucose control appears to be driven by a primary effect on insulin secretion [23]. The variants in MTNR1B are also associated with alterations to MTNR1B gene expression in human islet samples - the type 2 diabetes risk and glucose raising allele is associated with increased MTNR1B expression [23]. A large-scale exon sequencing study of the MTNR1B locus in more than 7,000 Europeans revealed 36 very rare variants (minor allele frequency <0.1%) associated with type 2 diabetes risk [26]. Four of these rare variants caused complete loss of melatonin binding and signaling capabilities [26]. It is not clear why rare reduced function mutations are associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk and a common allele that increases MTNR1B gene expression is also associated with increased risk. One suggestion is that the increased expression could be the result of the absence of negative feedback regulatory events under conditions of impaired melatonin receptor signaling [26]., Genetic studies have provided important insights into the relationships between obesity, inflammation and diabetes. Obesity is associated with a multitude of adverse metabolic traits, including insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia. One intriguing association is that between inflammation and obesity, but the causal direction is unknown. GWASs have identified genetic variants associated with obesity, and variants associated with inflammation. Variants in the FTO gene are associated with obesity and variants in the C-reactive protein (CRP) gene are associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels - an inflammatory marker synthesized by the liver. FTO associates with multiple metabolic phenotypes to the extent expected based on its association with BMI and the correlations between BMI and secondary metabolic phenotypes [27]. These associations include FTO versus circulating CRP levels [28]. In contrast CRP genetic variants are not associated with obesity [28]. These findings suggest that inflammatory markers, particularly CRP, do not causally influence the risk of obesity. This finding provides evidence that the subclinical inflammatory profile associated with obesity is more likely to be secondary to adiposity rather than causal. The causal effect of obesity on inflammatory markers is likely to be driven by adipocytes that are a key expresser of inflammatory molecules [29–31]., Recent genetic studies have highlighted a possible causal role for lower sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. This evidence comes from studies of genetic variation in the SHBG gene., SHBG, a plasma transport protein that is mainly produced by the liver, binds to sex hormones: estradiol, and with higher affinity to testosterone. It was assumed that SHBG plays one role only, which is regulation of free sex hormone bioavailability to target tissues. However, several physiologic roles have been suggested for SHBG through its multiple interactions with its receptor; these roles include modification of sex hormone uptake and cell proliferation [32–34]. The multiple interactions between SHBG and its receptors in various target tissues suggest that the role is more complex than the simple transport of sex hormones in serum., A number of observational epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between type 2 diabetes and androgens (primarily testosterone), estrogens (estradiol) and SHBG [34] that cannot be explained by adiposity. It is controversial whether SHBG is a cause or consequence of these conditions. The non-genetic evidence that suggests reduced SHBG levels increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, and the evidence that points to reverse causation, are summarized in Table 2.Table 2

                  , Two Mendelian randomization analyses, using genetic variants at the SHBG locus, have provided evidence that raised circulating SHBG levels reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes [35, 36]. In both studies, the effects of SHBG variants on risk of type 2 diabetes were consistent with those predicted by the effect of the SNPs on SHBG levels and the correlation between SHBG levels and type 2 diabetes., Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that reduced birth weight is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. There are two hypotheses proposed to explain the association between birth weight and type 2 diabetes. (a) The fetal programming hypothesis proposes that poor intra-uterine nutrition will not only cause small, thin babies, but also programs the development of risk factors of disease, such as type 2 diabetes in adults [37, 38]. (b) The fetal insulin hypothesis suggests that fetal genetics influencing insulin secretion and action have a direct effect on small, thin babies and their increased risk of type 2 diabetes [39]. Maternal genes such as GCK and TCF7L2 can indirectly, through their effect on intra-uterine glucose levels, influence fetal growth [40, 41]. The hypothesis suggests that the glucose raising variants in mothers increase the birth weight of offspring because the fetal pancreas is exposed to more glucose and therefore secretes more insulin. In contrast, the genetic variants at CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and ADCY5 loci are associated with birth weight through fetal genotype independently of maternal genotype [40–43]. Variants at the CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and ADCY5 loci are all associated with insulin secretion and their association with birth weight suggests the mechanism starts in prenatal life. The association of three type 2 diabetes loci, CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and ADCY5, with birth weight is consistent with the fetal insulin hypothesis. The assessment of the role of the remaining 62 type 2 diabetes loci with birth weight could elucidate whether type 2 diabetes loci in addition to CDKAL1, HHEX/IDE and ADCY5 also influence prenatal growth., The genetic links between type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits have highlighted possible new biological pathways. Nevertheless, genetic association studies have some limitations. One caveat is that the variant discovered by GWASs may not be the actual causal variant but just linked to it on a chromosome (linkage disequilibrium). Indeed, the causal variant could be in a nearby gene or non-genic region. The other limitation is that the variants discovered to be associated with complex traits explain a very small proportion of individual variation in disease risk or trait levels. These small effect sizes have compromised the disease predictive value of common genetic variants. One explanation is that common diseases such as type 2 diabetes are caused not only by many common variants with small effect but also by rare variants with larger effect that would not be detected in a GWAS. With the advent of high-throughput platforms and methods, full sequencing of samples could make it feasible to assess structural variants and rare variants and discover more of the heritable component to type 2 diabetes., In summary, we have presented a number of examples of how genetics helps us understand the complex associations between type 2 diabetes and many other metabolic traits, including glucose homeostasis, circadian rhythm, SHBG, inflammation and birth weight., GWASs, which do not rely on a prior understanding of disease biology, have resulted in remarkable progress in our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of type 2 diabetes in the last 5 years. We anticipate that advances in technology and resources, including very large sample sizes such as the 500,000 individuals available in the UK Biobank, will lead to even more progress in understanding the highly complex genetic and non-genetic risk factors for metabolic diseases."

We propose a method, CRAC, that integrates genomic locations and local coverage to enable such predictions to be made directly from RNA-seq read analysis. A k-mer profiling approach detects candidate mutations, indels and splice or chimeric junctions in each single read. CRAC increases precision compared with existing tools, reaching 99:5% for splice junctions, without losing sensitivity. Importantly, CRAC predictions improve with read length. In cancer libraries, CRAC recovered 74% of validated fusion RNAs and predicted novel recurrent chimeric junctions. CRAC is available at http://​crac.​gforge.​inria.​fr., Understanding the molecular processes responsible for normal development or tumorigenesis necessitates both identifying functionally important mutations and exploring the transcriptomic diversity of various tissues. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides genome-scale access to the RNA complement of a cell with unprecedented depth, and has therefore proven useful in unraveling the complexity of transcriptomes [1, 2]. The analyses of RNA-seq reads aim at detecting a variety of targets: from transcribed exons and classical splice junctions with canonical splice sites, to alternatively spliced RNAs, RNAs with non-standard splice sites, read-through and even non-colinear chimeric transcripts [3]. Moreover, RNA-seq also gives access to those somatic mutations and genetic polymorphisms that are transcribed. Chimeric RNAs result from the transcription of genes fused together by chromosomal rearrangements [4], especially in cancer [5], and they can also be induced by trans-splicing between mature messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [6]. RNA-seq can also capture these complex, non-colinear transcripts, whose molecular importance is still poorly assessed and which may provide new diagnostic or therapeutic targets [7, 8]., As next generation sequencing (NGS) improves and becomes cheaper, bioinformatic analyses become more critical and time consuming. They still follow the same paradigm as in the first days of NGS technologies: a multiple step workflow - mapping, coverage computation, and inference - where each step is heuristic, concerned with only a part of the necessary information, and is optimized independently from the others. Consequently analyses suffer from the drawbacks inherent to this paradigm: (a) pervasive erroneous information, (b) lack of integration, and (c) information loss, which induces re-computation at subsequent steps and prevents cross-verification. An example of the lack of integration is that the mapping step cannot use coverage information, which prevents it from distinguishing biological mutations from sequencing errors early in the analysis., Here, we design a novel and integrated strategy to analyze reads when a reference genome is available. Our approach extracts information solely from the genome and read sequences, and is independent of any annotation; we implemented it in a program named CRAC. The rationale behind it is that an integrated analysis avoids re-computation, minimizes false inferences, and provides precise information on the biological events carried by a read. A peculiarity of CRAC is that it can deliver computational predictions for point mutations, indels, sequence errors, normal and chimeric splice junctions, in a single run. CRAC is compared with state-of-the-art tools for mapping (BWA, SOAP2, Bowtie, and GASSST) [9–13], and both normal (GSNAP, TopHat, and MapSplice) [3, 14, 15] and chimeric (TopHat-fusion) [16] splice junction predictions. The results show the relevance of the approach in terms of efficiency, sensitivity, and precision (which is also termed specificity in the literature). We also provide true assessments of the sensitivity of each method by analyzing complex simulated data., Availability: CRAC is distributed under the GPL-compliant CeCILL-V2 license and is available as source code archive or a ready-to-install Linux package from the CRAC project website [17] or the ATGC bioinformatics platform [18]. It includes two programs: crac-index to generate the index of the genome, and crac for analyzing the reads., We evaluated CRAC for mapping reads, predicting candidate SNVs, indels, splice junctions, and chimeric junctions, and compared it to other tools. Simulated data are needed to compute exact sensitivity and accuracy levels, while real data enable us to study predictions with biologically validated RNAs. For simulating RNA-seq, we first altered a reference genome with random substitutions, indels, and translocations to derive a mutated genome, then reads were sequenced in silico using FluxSimulator [22], the annotated RefSeq transcripts, and a realistic distribution of random expression levels (Additional file 2). As read lengths will increase, we used two simulated datasets to assess different strategies: one (hs75) with a typical read length of 75, another (hs200) with reads of 200 nt representing the future., CRAC is a multi-purpose tool for analyzing RNA-seq data. In a single run it can predict sequencing errors, small mutations, and normal and chimeric splice junctions (collectively termed events). CRAC is not a pipeline, but a single program that can replace a combination of Bowtie, SAMtools, and TopHat/TopHat-fusion, and can be viewed as an effort to simplify NGS analysis. CRAC is not simply a mapper, since it uses local coverage information (in the support profile) before computing the genomic position of a read. In contrast to the current paradigm, mapping and post inferences are not disjoint steps in CRAC. Instead, it implements a novel, integrated approach that draws inferences by simultaneously analyzing both the genomic locations and the support of all k-mers along the read. The support of a k-mer, defined as the number of reads sharing it, approximates the local read coverage without having the reads mapped. The combined k-mers location and support profiles enable CRAC to infer precisely the read and genomic positions of an event, its structure, as well as to distinguish errors from biological events. Integration is not only the key to an accurate classification of reads (Additional file 1), but it avoids information loss and saves re-computation, and is thereby crucial for efficiency. Indeed, CRAC takes more time than state-of-the-art mappers, but is considerably faster than splice junction prediction tools (for example, Bowtie plus TopHat). The other key to efficiency is the double-indexing strategy: a classical FM-index (where FM stands for Ferragina - Manzini) for the genome and the Gk arrays for the reads [21]. This makes CRAC's memory requirement higher than that of other tools, but fortunately computers equipped with 64 gigabytes of memory are widespread nowadays. Experiments conducted on simulated data (where all answers are known), which are necessary for assessing a method's sensitivity, have shown that for each type of prediction CRAC is at least competitive or surpasses current tools in terms of sensitivity, while it generally achieves better precision. Moreover, CRAC's performances further improve when processing longer reads: for example on 200 nt reads, it has 85% sensitivity and 99.3% precision for predicting splice junctions., CRAC analyzes how the location and support profiles vary and concord along the read. Hence k-mers serve as seeds (in the genome and in the read set), and k is thus a key parameter. Its choice depends on the genome length [19], and quite conservative values - k = 22 for the human genome - have been used in our experiments. Smaller k values are possible with smaller genomes (like bacterial ones). k affects the number of false genomic locations (FLs) that occur in the profile; a FL indicates a wrong location for a k-mer, which differs from the location of origin of the sequenced molecule. This tends to induce a false location for the read (mapping) or a false location for a junction border (normal and chimeric junction prediction). However, CRAC uses two criteria to avoid these pitfalls: the coherence of locations for adjacent k-mers over a range and the concordance of locations for the k-mers around the break (especially in the break verification and fusion procedures; see Additional File 2). When k-mers surrounding the break have a few, but several, locations, CRAC examines all possible combinations, and as FL occurrences are governed mainly by randomness, this eliminates discordant positions. FLs have a larger effect on the prediction of chimeras. Overall, the results on both simulated and real data, like the improved mapping sensitivity (+15 points compared to Bowtie, BWA, and SOAP2), show that CRAC makes accurate predictions with conservative values. k controls the balance between sensitivity (shorter seeds) and precision. The breast cancer libraries we used have 50 nt reads, but CRAC could still find 74% of the chimeric RNAs validated by Edgren et al. [27]. Of course, the k value has two limitations: first, the minimal exon size detectable in a read is ≥k, second, reads must be long enough (>40 nt with k = 20 for the human genome). However, NGS is progressing towards longer reads, which should become standard, and Figure 4c illustrates well CRAC's ability to detect short exons within single reads. The k-mer profiling approach detects events located near the read extremities, but cannot exactly determine their position in the read. Hence the inference rules cannot be fully applied, and CRAC classifies such reads as incompletely determined (Undetermined and BioUndetermined files). However, the position of an event in a read is random, and thus, the high coverage delivered by NGS nearly ensures that the same event occurs in the middle of other reads covering it. Consequently, border cases do not hinder CRAC from detecting mutations, splice junctions, etc. Only errors escape this rule since they are mostly read specific. A more complex drawback of k-mer profiling is when two events are located <k positions apart on the genome (see the BCAS4-BCAS3 chimera); again such cases even with a high support are not fully resolved and end up in the BioUndetermined file. A post-processing of reads in this file, for example by an alignment program, could clearly save such cases. Obviously, such cases are rare, and we keep this as future work. As briefly mentioned, k-mer profiling also detects when reads span a repeat border region, which should help in inferring the locations of mobile genetic elements, duplications, or copy number variations; this suggests further developments and CRAC's usefulness for analyzing genomic data., Determining the correct genomic location of reads is crucial information for any NGS data analysis and especially for cataloging all transcripts of a cell with RNA-seq. Generally, a mapping step computes this information using efficient, well-known tools (BWA, Bowtie, and SOAP2), but the mapping sensitivity is rarely questioned. We performed extensive mapping tests on simulated data, which showed that sensitivity can truly be improved and that CRAC makes a significant step in this direction. Of course by considering discontinuous alignments (as do CRAC and GSNAP) many reads covering splice junctions can be mapped, which BWA, Bowtie/Bowtie2, and SOAP2 cannot detect. However, the mapping results for categories of reads carrying one mutation, a short indel, or even errors indicate that classical mappers missed between 15 to 20 points in sensitivity, thereby confirming that the difference due to splice junction reads is critical even for other events, while CRAC performs equally well (>90%) whatever the category (Figure 2). The other way around, those tools are able to map 10% to 35% of reads containing a splice junction. This can negatively affect downstream analyses depending on the type of events under investigation. For instance to predict splice junctions, in the current strategy (TopHat, MapSplice, or TopHat-fusion), reads are first mapped with Bowtie to divide the collection into: (a) reads having a continuous alignment on the genome and (b) unmapped reads. The former serve further to delimit exons, and the latter are then processed again to search for spliced alignments. If a read that requires a discontinuous alignment is mapped by Bowtie, it is not considered by TopHat, MapSplice, or TopHat-fusion as potentially containing a junction, and they will not find a spliced alignment for it. In contrast, CRAC's k-mer profiling approach is flexible, reliable in this respect (Figure 3), and importantly, adapts well to longer reads (for example, 200 nt). This last point is key since longer reads will be available soon. They will much more likely incorporate not one, but several events - errors, mutations, splice junctions, etc. - and thus be harder to map. Whatever the class of required predictions, CRAC's sensitivity is always improved with longer reads. This is crucial for detecting multiple exons within single reads, and CRAC exhibits a better ability in this as exemplified by a transcript of TIMM50 gene (Figure 4c)., An issue in transcriptomics is to reliably extract the complete set of splice junctions with a minimal number of false positives [24]. In this regard, our results (Table 2) demonstrate that k-mer profiling approaches (MapSplice and CRAC) profit greatly in sensitivity from longer reads, and that CRAC is the tool with the highest precision whatever the read length. They also indicate that CRAC handles difficult cases with higher sensitivity, like long-distance splices, multi-exon reads, or RNA expressed at a low level. The analysis of a multi-tissue library shows that CRAC, GSNAP, and MapSplice have a very large (>90%) agreement on the set of reported known junctions (>140,000 distinct junctions), RefSeq transcripts, and genes, thereby providing evidence of their ability to extract splice junctions of well-annotated transcripts (Figure 4b and 4a). In contrast, TopHat misses 21% of these known RefSeq junctions. Comparatively, CRAC reports fewer novel or unknown junctions than other tools, and tends to be more conservative, which likely reflects its precision. Altogether, CRAC is a solution for exploring qualitatively the transcriptome of a sample with high sensitivity and precision, and thus provides the primary material for determining all transcript structures, which is indispensable for estimating the expression levels of all RNA isoforms [3, 26]., Recent investigations have suggested that non-colinear RNAs are quantitatively more abundant in human transcriptomes than previously thought, underlining the structural diversity of these chimeric RNAs and their occurrence in cancers [8, 27, 28, 35, 36]. Predicting chimeric RNAs (chRNAs) is the most difficult and error-prone computation when analyzing RNA-seq. The combinatorial possibilities of aligning a read partly to two distinct regions on the same or different chromosomes [4] increase the likeliness of predicting FPs. It explains why filtering for suboptimal but colinear alignments of an apparent chimeric read may still help, and also partly why TopHat-fusion per se yields so many more chRNA candidates compared to CRAC (Table 4). Paired end reads are not sufficient: analyzing single reads by splitting them is inevitable for predicting the chimeric junction point; hence k-mer profiling also suits this purpose. Nevertheless, paired end reads are useful for performing a complementary consolidation of chRNA candidates, which we may develop in the future. However, chRNAs can occur at low expression levels and be much less expressed than their parental genes; this impels CRAC to rely less on the support profile than for mutation prediction. In addition, transcriptional noise or template switching during library preparation may generate true chimeric reads from biologically irrelevant chRNAs. Thus, subsequent criteria are definitely needed to prioritize chRNA candidates: the consistent finding of the same junction point has been suggested as an important one [27, 36, 37]. Notably, CRAC predicted for the four breast cancer libraries 36 recurrent chRNAs that were not reported previously [16, 27], and 35/36 always harbor the same junction point in the different libraries and among the distinct reads predicting them. Several of these involve genes known to be implicated in tumorigenesis or tumor maintenance, like GNAS [31] or HSPD1 [30]. As CRAC outputs also included 74% of validated chRNAs with a single clear false negative, this shows that CRAC consistently reports interesting chRNA candidates based on the read data. As already mentioned, CRAC distinguishes between five chRNA classes, included those exhibiting small-scale sequence inversions, as illustrated by a chRNA within the LONP1 gene, which recurs in normal and tumoral libraries. We also reported cases of chRNAs, which although validated, do not constitute good candidates for the computational inference step, since not enough reads in the data support their existence. The latter point is critical and strengthens how difficult chimeric RNA prediction is., Here, the in silico experiments focus on transcriptomic data, but the method is also applicable to genomic sequencing. For instance, the counterparts of splice junctions and chimeras in RNA-seq are large deletions and rearrangements (translocation, inversion, and displacement of a mobile element) in DNA. Thus, CRAC may also prove useful for genomic analyses.,

We place the genome into a comparative evolutionary context, and focus on genomic features associated with tooth loss, immune function, longevity, sex differentiation and determination, and the species' physiological capacities to withstand extreme anoxia and tissue freezing., Our phylogenetic analyses confirm that turtles are the sister group to living archosaurs, and demonstrate an extraordinarily slow rate of sequence evolution in the painted turtle. The ability of the painted turtle to withstand complete anoxia and partial freezing appears to be associated with common vertebrate gene networks, and we identify candidate genes for future functional analyses. Tooth loss shares a common pattern of pseudogenization and degradation of tooth-specific genes with birds, although the rate of accumulation of mutations is much slower in the painted turtle. Genes associated with sex differentiation generally reflect phylogeny rather than convergence in sex determination functionality. Among gene families that demonstrate exceptional expansions or show signatures of strong natural selection, immune function and musculoskeletal patterning genes are consistently over-represented., Our comparative genomic analyses indicate that common vertebrate regulatory networks, some of which have analogs in human diseases, are often involved in the western painted turtle's extraordinary physiological capacities. As these regulatory pathways are analyzed at the functional level, the painted turtle may offer important insights into the management of a number of human health disorders.","Amniote phylogeny, anoxia tolerance, chelonian, freeze tolerance, genomics, longevity, phylogenomics, physiology, turtle, evolutionary rates","Turtles (also known as chelonians or Testudines) are an enigma. As the vertebrate paleontologist Alfred Romer noted half a century ago, 'The chelonians are the most bizarre, and yet in many respects the most conservative, of reptilian groups. Because they are still living, turtles are commonplace objects to us; were they entirely extinct, [they] would be a cause for wonder'[1]. From the Triassic to the present, turtles have been morphologically conservative, and even the earliest turtles [2] are instantly recognizable. The living crown group of turtles extends back at least 210 million years [3] and is characterized by a number of unique morphological and physiological features. Besides their distinctive shell, turtles have extremely long lifespans, are often reproductively active at very advanced ages, often determine sex by the temperature at which eggs incubate, are the most anoxia-tolerant tetrapods known, and have the capacity in some species to freeze nearly solid, thaw, and survive with negligible tissue damage. The western painted turtle genome harbors a wealth of information on the genetic basis of these and other adaptations that characterize this unique vertebrate lineage., Two of the great physiological challenges to vertebrate survival are hypoxia and cold tolerance. Particularly for temperate ectotherms like the western painted turtle, the two are closely linked, because winter hibernation often occurs underwater in ice-locked ponds, and involves long periods with limited access to oxygen. The western painted turtle is capable of surviving, with no loss of physiological function, 4 months under conditions of exceptionally low oxygen availability at 3°C [4] and at least 30 h at 20ºC [5]. This anoxia tolerance, when combined with the ability to survive freezing of 50% body water [6], allows hatchling painted turtles to endure long winters in their nests across the northern part of their range in North America. It also provides an unprecedented model to study natural mechanisms that protect the heart and brain from hypoxia-induced injury. Cardiac infarct and cerebral stroke are the first and third leading causes of death in the United States [7], and while conventional therapies continue to extend human lifespan, progress in improving outcomes from these conditions has been limited. Our genomic analyses indicate that painted turtles frequently achieve their extreme physiological capacities, at least in part, using conserved amniote molecular pathways; functional analyses of these pathways across turtles with varying physiological capacities thus may provide important insights for human disease prevention., The western painted turtle, and chelonians generally, comprise a unique combination of extremely conservative evolutionary history interspersed with some of the most unique physiological and behavioral adaptations found in amniotes. Our analyses of the western painted turtle genome indicate that common vertebrate regulatory pathways are often involved with these novel phenotypes, and additional functional experiments can now investigate the ways in which these pathways have been modified in turtles. Our extensive analyses of anoxia tolerance provides particularly strong support for the interpretation that the western painted turtle utilizes common vertebrate pathways to achieve its extraordinary physiological abilities; temperature-dependent sex determination and immune system functionality also appear to utilize common suites of vertebrate genes. Genomic analyses of longevity and particularly tooth loss, both of which characterize all living chelonians, suggest that patterns of gene loss are also key elements of turtle evolutionary novelties. The western painted turtle genome, enabled by both comparative genomics and functional experimentation, has provided and will continue to provide windows into the evolution of physiological novelties, perhaps including some with biomedical and cryopreservation applications., One aspect of turtle evolution that is proceeding at a rapid and accelerating pace is human-mediated extinction. Although the lineages represented by living turtles have survived countless challenges in the last 210 million years, current estimates are that at least 50% of the 330 recognized species of living chelonians are threatened with extinction [64]. Turtles far outstrip amphibians, mammals, and birds in their proportion of at-risk species, and the survival likelihood of many species is bleak. Future comparative genomics work on turtles, including comparisons among species that vary in their longevity, anoxia and freeze tolerances, immunocompetency, and a host of other key human challenges, requires healthy populations of the remaining diversity of turtles. The challenge, for comparative biology and conservation alike, is to preserve the remaining diversity of living turtles as we continue to unravel their secrets for success., The Chrysemys picta bellii whole-genome shotgun project has been deposited in NCBI GenBank under the project accession AHGY00000000. The raw input data for Chrysemys picta bellii (BioProject ID: 78657) was deposited to the trace archive and the SRA under the project accession SRP012057. The Apalone spinifera whole genome data can be found at the NCBI SRA under the accession numbers SRX217616-7. Specimen collection for the C. picta bellii was authorized by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife under scientific collecting permit 08-086 (to RCT) and complied with IACUC standards at UC Davis (HBS protocol holder). Ethical (IACUC) approvals for all experiments involving living turtles were obtained at the university where the experiment or field work were conducted., We provide three Additional Files. Two Additional Files are in Microsoft word (.docx). Additional file 1 contains Tables S1-S17), and Additional file 2 contains Figures S1-S12). We also provide Additional file 3 in support of the selection scan analysis in Microsoft Excel format.

However, in avian species like the ground tit Pseudopodoces humilis, the adaptation mechanism remains unclear. The phylogeny of the ground tit is also controversial., Using next generation sequencing technology, we generated and assembled a draft genome sequence of the ground tit. The assembly contained 1.04 Gb of sequence that covered 95.4% of the whole genome and had higher N50 values, at the level of both scaffolds and contigs, than other sequenced avian genomes. About 1.7 million SNPs were detected, 16,998 protein-coding genes were predicted and 7% of the genome was identified as repeat sequences. Comparisons between the ground tit genome and other avian genomes revealed a conserved genome structure and confirmed the phylogeny of ground tit as not belonging to the Corvidae family. Gene family expansion and positively selected gene analysis revealed genes that were related to cardiac function. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the adaptation of this species to extreme environmental living conditions., Our data and analysis contribute to the study of avian evolutionary history and provide new insights into the adaptation mechanisms to extreme conditions in animals.","genome, high-altitude adaptation, phylogeny","The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), known as 'the roof of the world', has become the focus of many biological studies. Many aboriginal animals, such as the Tibetan antelope, sheep and yak, and even humans (Tibetans), survive there under extreme environmental condition, including reduced oxygen supply and freezing temperatures. Similar scenarios can be found in the Andean Altiplano (guinea pig) and Ethiopia's Simien Plateau (Simien fox), the two other highland plateaus on Earth. Scientists have begun to explore the mechanisms that underlie organisms' adaptation to high altitudes. Some genes related to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans [1–3] and in yaks [4] have been detected. Some studies have investigated birds at high altitudes and across altitude gradients. Bulgarella et al. [5] reported the combined effects of selection and population history on levels of population divergence for the crested duck (Lophonetta specularioides), which is distributed across an altitudinal gradient and in which selection for hypoxia resistance may have played an important role. Multilocus coalescent analysis revealed hemoglobin differentiation between low- and high-altitude populations of crested ducks [5]. In the bar-headed goose, adaptations in mitochondrial enzyme kinetics and oxygen transport capacity through the molecular evolution of cytochrome C oxidase were thought to contribute to the exceptional ability of these geese to fly at high altitudes [6]. However, in the QTP native avian species Pseudopodoces humilis (common name, the ground tit), the genetic mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation have never been studied. These birds exhibit morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations to life in this open habitat, including pale cryptic plumage; a long decurved bill for probing in crevices among rocks or in the ground; long legs for terrestrial locomotion; and nesting in burrows of small mammals, rock crevices, or building holes [7]. Ground tits may have adapted to high-altitude conditions via different genes or functional pathways., There has also been controversy about the phylogeny of the ground tit. It was first classified as belonging to the Pseudopodoces genus [8], but a recent phylogenetic analysis indicated that it was not a member of the Corvidae family [9]. Recently, the ground tit was determined to belong to the Paridae family, according to an analysis of its mitochondrial genome and some of its nuclear genes [7]. However, because the whole genome sequence of the ground tit and other close avian species are still unavailable, no definite conclusion has yet been reached., To date, very little genetic or other information about the ground tit has been published. To explore the genetic mechanisms of the ground tit's adaptation to high altitude, we sequenced its genome and identified 16,998 protein coding genes. The results provided an insight into the evolutionary relationships among avian species, and also between and within Passeriformes (including P. humilis (ground tit) and T. guttata (zebra finch)) and between Galliformes (including G. gallus (chicken) and M. gallopavo (turkey)). In addition, we aimed to identify some of the factors that contribute to the high-altitude adaptation of the ground tit, which may help in understanding the mechanisms used by other species in the QTP highlands., The ground tit genome sequence described here represents a high quality avian genome sequenced by a next generation sequencing platform. Its assembly is comparable to other available genomes in terms of genome coverage, and has a better sequence continuity. Furthermore, the high sequencing depth confirmed the accuracy of the assembly at the nucleotide level. Overall, the high quality of this genome makes it a valuable resource for comparative genomics. Our micro-synteny analysis among the ground tit, zebra finch, and chicken illustrated that their genome structures were relatively conserved. Our observation agrees with the reports of conserved overall synteny between zebra finch and chicken [30] and also between chicken and turkey [31], indicating a conserved genome structure among these avian species. However, this inference requires further confirmation using more sequenced avian genomes., The phylogeny of the ground tit has been controversial. It was classified as a species of the family Corvidae, and this classification is reflected in its other common name, Hume's groundpecker. However, some reports have suggested that in genetic distance it is closer to the family Paridae [7], according to independent datasets drawn from comparative osteology, the nuclear c-myc gene, and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Our phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the ground tit does not belong to the Corvidae family, agreeing with the previous report that analyzed certain nuclear genes [7]. The species tree presented here, based on the current available genomic data, provided convincing evidence that the ground tit is not a crow species; however more genomes belonging to Paridae and its relatives are required to confirm the ground tit's taxonomic status and evolutionary relationships., The evolution of hormone-behavior adaptations may have helped the ground tit cope with the extreme environments on the QTP. This kind of adaptation strategy, involving hormone regulatory mechanisms for physiology and behavior in extreme conditions, has been used by birds that breed on the arctic tundra [32, 33]. We identified several genes that are under positive selection, including ADRBK1 and HSD17B7, which are involved in the adrenaline response and steroid hormone biosynthesis, correlating with an adaptation strategy of hormone regulatory mechanisms for physiology and behavior in extreme conditions. Further, both ADRBK1 and CSRP3 play significant roles in cardiac muscle contraction and heart development. Neuropeptides and glycosylation modification may be linked to adaptation strategies, but this hypothesis requires further support. Mutations in the CSRP3 gene have been suggested to cause heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy in humans [34]. Nevertheless, unlike other QTP animals (for example, the yak), we did not find evidence of positive selection for genes associated with energy metabolism in the ground tit. A previous study observed some genetic adaptation to the highland environment in the Tibetan population [2]; however, considering the relatively short time that humans have lived in this region and the different energy requirements of mammals and birds, the genetic mechanism of adaptation in the ground tit may be different from that in mammals, for which the hypoxia-inducible factors pathway may play an important role, and which calls for a wider genomic comparison of high land species., The ground tit genome was sequenced and compared with the genomes of other animals, especially birds. Phylogeny analysis confirmed that the ground tit did not belong to the Corvidae family. The roles of genes related to cardiac function were implicated in the adaptation of ground tit to the extreme highland environment."
"161","The future of genomic medicine is here","Konrad J Karczewski","Biomedical Informatics Training Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine","Konrad J Karczewski","konradjkarczewski@gmail.com","27 March 2013","","","A report on the 6th annual Future of Genomic Medicine conference, held at the Scripps Seaside Forum, La Jolla, CA, USA, March 7-8, 2013., It is becoming increasingly clear, at this and other conferences, such as the Cold Spring Harbor Personal Genomes meetings, that genomics can have a profound role in guiding diagnoses and treatments. A major theme of this year's conference was the patient perspective and their reaction to having their genome sequenced in a clinical setting. The conference started with a direct perspective from the parents of Lilly Grossman, a patient with a lifelong undiagnosed disease, marked by tremors and sleepless nights. After having her full genome sequenced by the Idiopathic Diseases of Man (IDIOM) study, led by Topol, mutations in ADCY5 and DOCK3 were able to putatively explain her phenotype, and suggest a possible treatment, which provided a few weeks of regular sleep. While the result was not a conclusive answer, it provided hope for the patient and her family. Howard Jacob (Medical College of Wisconsin, USA) agreed, stressing that even in the absence of clinical utility (if a diagnosis is not actionable), the personal utility of having a diagnosis is important to the patient and the patient's family. Jacob suggested a consumer-driven economy for personal genomics, and that even though variants and annotations are subject to change as technologies and interpretations improve, involving patients in the process can be an effective way to deal with these changes. Misha Angrist (Duke University, USA) mirrored these sentiments, drawing parallels to open-access publishing: subjects should have the right to their own data and to see results of the studies that use their data. Randy Scott (Invitae, USA) outlined his and Invitae's mission of bringing genetics to the masses by building databases and infrastructure for managing genetic information. The books that were handed out to participants reflected this mission, between AJ Jacob's Drop Dead Healthy, a foray into taking control of one's health, as well as the book by myself (Konrad Karczewski, Stanford University, USA) and Joel Dudley (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA): Exploring Personal Genomics, a handbook to understanding and interpreting personal genetic data., While much of these opinions on patient perspectives were anecdotal, Cinnamon Bloss (Scripps Translational Science Institute, USA) presented hard data on the perceptions of both patients and physicians, and the differences therein, through surveys of families. Parents of patients and their doctor agreed that the doctor was knowledgeable about genetics, but the parents were much less satisfied with the doctor's explanations of the results. However, Bloss noted that the majority of patients, parents and physicians were interested in receiving secondary findings, regardless of age of onset or actionability and desire for these results increased with actionability for all three groups., Another major scientific theme of FoGM this year involved the expansion past somatic variants (SNPs) to other technologies that could be integrated to inform diagnosis and treatment. In addition to getting his genome sequenced, Michael Snyder (Stanford University, USA) tracked a number of omics technologies over time, including his transcriptome, proteome and metabolome, and used this information to track the onset of diabetes concurrent with infection. Since every patient is unique, an 'N of 1' study, followed longitudinally over time, provided him with interesting observations of altered physiological states (such as infection) compared with his healthy state., While Snyder's analysis was aimed at comprehensive profiling of a healthy individual, Elaine Mardis (Washington University in St Louis, USA) suggested a similar approach for cancers, where sequencing RNAs in addition to DNA would inform predictions of peptides binding with HLA class I. Such an analysis would prioritize antigens that could then be used for personalized immunotherapy. Eric Schadt (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA) used similar data types to discover personal cancer drivers and create patient-specific networks that could suggest personalized cancer treatments., George Weinstock (Washington University in St Louis, USA) and Michael Eisen (University of California, Davis, USA) both brought the microbiome into the mix. Weinstock described efforts to sequence neonatal microbiomes to predict antimicrobial resistance, and discussed a future of fecal transplants and microbiome-based acne treatments. Eisen shared the optimism that the microbiome will become important for human phenotypes, but cautioned against overselling and being careful between correlation and causation, which becomes difficult for large numbers of hypotheses whose outcomes may be linked to their causes. Additionally, we already have a high demand for genetic counselors, but additional data types may bring similar demands, as Eisen called for microbiome counselors., Finally, a conference of this nature would not be complete without a call to arms for developing methods and models that will ultimately enable physicians to use genomic information in a clinical setting. Daniel MacArthur (Massachusetts General Hospital, USA) cautioned that consistent calling of exomes and genomes is of utmost importance for variant accuracy. He laid out the challenges for scaling up to variant calling of more than 26,000 exomes, but presented one solution in reduced BAMs, a compressed format, that then can be used for joint variant calling to increase accuracy. From this dataset, MacArthur was able to catalog tolerated protein-coding variation. David Goldstein (Duke University, USA) used such tolerated variants to identify genes that were likely to be functional and focused on these to narrow genetic factors for epileptic encephalopathy., Peter Visscher (University of Queensland, Australia) described models for predicting complex traits from genotype, which will become increasingly important for sequencing of healthy individuals and prioritization of disease risks. Atul Butte (Stanford University, USA) brought this message back to the clinic, using likelihood ratios, which doctors already use, to combine variant risk information into a unified risk factor. While six gigabytes of genetic data may seem overwhelming at first, Butte reminds us that there is a specialty that routinely analyzes gigabyte scale data: the radiologist. All that are needed are the proper tools., The consensus among speakers at FoGM this year was clear: the genome has an important role in the clinic. With the price of sequencing dropping to costs amenable to regular clinical use, the question now is not if, but how, genomic information will be integrated. There is a coming onslaught of 'big data' that will improve individual healthcare and enable genomic personalized medicine. Challenges still remain, including establishing a patient-centric view of genomic data, which is tied to educating the public and encouraging participation in personal health, as well as standardizing models to most accurately identify causal variation and portray disease risk. As these and new challenges arise, it will take a concerted effort of physicians and scientists to bring forth a future of genomic medicine."

But due to their own inability to agree on larger budget issues, they are doing it anyway. And it's not just the sequester: the latest cuts come on top of a multi-year freeze in NIH funding, in which annual budgets have been flat or declining in real terms., Science doesn't operate on a short-term basis. Cures for major diseases take years, often decades, to develop. And within the field, we can see tremendous progress on many fronts. Our understanding of cancer, heart disease, infectious diseases, aging, genetic diseases and a host of other conditions is moving ahead in leaps and bounds. This is the time to invest more, not less., Although these cuts are devastating to NIH research, in the context of the US budget, they won't affect a thing. The entire NIH budget (http://​www.​nih.​gov/​about/​budget.​htm), supporting research on hundreds of diseases, is about $31 billion. The total US budget last year was $3.7 trillion. Thus an 8.2% cut from NIH saves just 0.07% of the federal budget. Or to put it another way: the Pentagon program to build the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which won't be ready until at least 2019, is already estimated to cost $400 billion (http://​www.​gao.​gov/​assets/​660/​652948.​pdf), equal to the entire NIH budget for 13 years. And that's just one plane., What's more, NIH funding is a terrific investment. A nonpartisan study in 2000 (http://​www.​faseb.​org/​portals/​0/​pdfs/​opa/​2008/​nih_​research_​benefits.​pdf) found that publicly funded research yields a return of 25% to 40% per year. Where else can you get that kind of return on anything? But because this is a long-term investment, private businesses won't fund it, although they too benefit from the stream of discoveries and new technologies supported by public research funds., We recently bailed out Wall Street because it is 'too big to fail.' Our biomedical research enterprise is not too big to fail - financially, that is. But how sick do we have to get before we decide we shouldn't have cut our investment in biomedical research?, Congress can do many things to show that they care about curing disease. If they really do care, they should first restore NIH's budget for this year. Then they should take action to insulate biomedical research from the endless, internecine battles between the parties. A good first step would be to approve multi-year funding plans for NIH and NSF, just as these agencies award multi-year grants to scientists. The default action should leave these multi-year plans in place. So the 'do nothing' option each year wouldn't cut the legs out from under active research projects, but instead would ensure at least level funding from year to year., By the time scientists reach the point where they can lead productive research programs, we've already invested heavily in their training. Let's not kick them out on the street because someone in Congress wants to score political points. The health of the nation deserves better."

A recent outbreak destroyed more than 15 million hectares of pine forests, with major environmental effects on forest health, and economic effects on the forest industry. The outbreak has in part been driven by climate change, and will contribute to increased carbon emissions through decaying forests., We developed a genome sequence resource for the mountain pine beetle to better understand the unique aspects of this insect's biology. A draft de novo genome sequence was assembled from paired-end, short-read sequences from an individual field-collected male pupa, and scaffolded using mate-paired, short-read genomic sequences from pooled field-collected pupae, paired-end short-insert whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing reads of mRNA from adult beetle tissues, and paired-end Sanger EST sequences from various life stages. We describe the cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, and plant cell wall-degrading enzyme gene families important to the survival of the mountain pine beetle in its harsh and nutrient-poor host environment, and examine genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism variation. A horizontally transferred bacterial sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase was evident in the genome, and its tissue-specific transcription suggests a functional role for this beetle., Despite Coleoptera being the largest insect order with over 400,000 described species, including many agricultural and forest pest species, this is only the second genome sequence reported in Coleoptera, and will provide an important resource for the Curculionoidea and other insects.","Coleoptera, Curculionoidea, Scolytinae, bark beetles, conifer, cytochrome P450, glutathione S-transferase, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, horizontal gene transfer, sex chromosomes","The order Coleoptera (beetles) is the most species-rich order of insects, with over 400,000 described species [1], yet to date only one coleopteran genome sequence has been published, that of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum, superfamily Tenebrionoidea), a pest of stored grain products [2]. The superfamily Curculionoidea (weevils) diverged from Tenebrionoidea 236 million years ago (Mya) [3], and contains over 60,000 described species, including many of the world's insect pest species. One such group of pest species are the bark beetles (subfamily Scolytinae), encompassing over 6,000 species in approximately 220 genera. Currently, one of the most destructive bark beetle species is the mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins. MPB has had a long recorded history of major outbreaks in western North America, and attacks many pine species (Pinus spp.) [4]. The current MPB epidemic far exceeds the scope of any previously recorded bark beetle outbreak, with over 15 million hectares of pine forests, predominantly lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), infested in British Columbia alone [4]. In recent years, MPB has been found east of the northern Canadian Rockies, which was previously thought to be an effective geographical barrier [5]. This range expansion includes infestation of pine species not previously encountered by MPB, particularly jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and its hybrid with lodgepole pine [6]. As the predominantly jack pine boreal forest extends to the Atlantic coast, the potential for this beetle to spread further eastward is of major ecological, environmental, and economic concern [4, 7]., MPB is one of 16 species of Dendroctonus described in the New World, with habitats ranging from Nicaragua to arctic North America [8], and additional single species in both northern Europe and Asia. As members of the tribe Tomicini in the Scolytinae, Dendroctonus have ancient associations with conifers [9]. Most Dendroctonus species are capable of killing their conifer hosts, an ancestral ability of this genus [10], and several species are considered serious pests. MPB is present over a wide latitude range, has thus adapted to wide temperature ranges, and has a measurable spatial genetic structure [11]. The ability of MPB and Dendroctonus in general to inhabit a wide range of latitudes may foretell future range expansion with anticipated climate change [4, 12], and may substantially affect future carbon cycles as beetle-killed trees decay or burn to release their stored carbon [7, 13]., The success of MPB and many other bark beetle species in overcoming the defenses of their conifer host [14, 15] and in colonizing the trees is due in part to their pheromone-mediated mass attack on individual trees [16]. Both male and female beetles produce aggregation pheromones that effectively initiate and modulate the mass attack. These compounds are identical or similar across most Dendroctonus species and some other Scolytinae [17]. Another factor in their success in killing trees originates from the symbiotic fungi that the beetles vector to new host trees. These fungi, such as the pathogenic blue stain ascomycete, Grosmannia clavigera (for which extensive genomic resources are available [18–21]) infiltrate the sapwood of the tree and effectively block water transport. Both the beetles and associated fungi probably contribute to detoxification and metabolism of defense chemicals in the host pine., Although transcriptomic resources are available for Scolytinae [22–24], the genome sequence of MPB will provide a valuable new reference for further studies in this and related Coleoptera. A challenge with assembling the genome of non-model organisms such as MPB is the difficulty or impossibility of obtaining highly inbred individuals to reduce the heterozygosity. As the cost of sequencing continues to drop, genome sequencing will be feasible for many more organisms, many of which are not practical or amenable to extensive inbreeding. Thus, the assembly processes must be adapted to resolve the issues of greater heterozygosity for assembly of diploid genomes into haploid, or alternatively diploid, assemblies., We report the draft de novo genome sequence of MPB, and describe several highlights including the presence of a horizontally transferred gene, the identification of genome sequence representing the sex chromosomes, genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation and distribution, and gene families with roles in host colonization., Our demonstration of a successful de novo assembly of a draft genome sequence from short-read sequences from an individual insect without inbreeding to reduce heterozygosity is a forerunner to projects that aim to sequence non-model insects, such as in the i5k initiative [65]. The genome sequence of MPB provides a novel resource in Curculionoidea, many species of which are economically and ecologically important pests in forestry and agriculture. It also provides comparative data for the T. castaneum genome sequence to study the evolution of Coleoptera and insects in general. Our initial efforts to identify portions of the assembly corresponding to the sex chromosomes provide the framework for more comprehensive linkage studies using other approaches., Our analyses of the MPB genome sequence identified unique features that may benefit the beetle for living in a plant defense-rich and nutrient-poor environment over a large geographic and bioclimatic range. The large number of SNPs identified here, when examined more thoroughly across multiple populations, will provide insights into the structure and natural variation in MPB populations throughout western North America, and may facilitate understanding of how the beetle is adapting to new hosts, new geographical ranges, and climatic conditions., The presence of a bacterial sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase in the genome sequence of MPB, which is also present in other Dendroctonus species with different hosts and different geographical ranges, and its tissue-specific expression in MPB midguts, suggests a unique functional integration of a horizontally transferred gene for carbohydrate utilization by MPB. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the role of this horizontally transferred gene in host colonization as a complement to the PCWDEs that were found in abundance in the MPB genome., Some members of the P450 and GST gene families are probably involved in the detoxification of host defense compounds and in the production of pheromones that facilitate mass attack of the tree. The specific areas of expansion of these gene families relative to T. castaneum and other insect species hint at their roles in the specific biological processes necessary for MPB to be such a significant pest of pines."

This is partly due to the poor annotation of the W chromosome, which is speculated to carry a female determinant. Few genes have been mapped to the W and little is known of their expression., We used RNA-seq to produce a comprehensive profile of gene expression in chicken blastoderms and embryonic gonads prior to sexual differentiation. We found robust sexually dimorphic gene expression in both tissues pre-dating gonadogenesis, including sex-linked and autosomal genes. This supports the hypothesis that sexual differentiation at the molecular level is at least partly cell autonomous in birds. Different sets of genes were sexually dimorphic in the two tissues, indicating that molecular sexual differentiation is tissue specific. Further analyses allowed the assembly of full-length transcripts for 26 W chromosome genes, providing a view of the W transcriptome in embryonic tissues. This is the first extensive analysis of W-linked genes and their expression profiles in early avian embryos., Sexual differentiation at the molecular level is established in chicken early in embryogenesis, before gonadal sex differentiation. We find that the W chromosome is more transcriptionally active than previously thought, expand the number of known genes to 26 and present complete coding sequences for these W genes. This includes two novel W-linked sequences and three small RNAs reassigned to the W from the Un_Random chromosome.","Sex determination, Embryonic chicken gonad, W chromosome, Avian sex, RNA-seq","Sex determination in mammals and birds occurs at fertilization, with the differential inheritance of sex chromosomes [1]. Mammals have an XX/XY sex chromosome system, characterised by male heterogamety (XY), while birds have a ZZ/ZW system and female heterogamety (ZW). In eutherian mammals, almost all genes on the Y chromosome are associated with male development and fitness, namely the testis-determining SRY gene and genes required for spermatogenesis [2]. The Z and W sex chromosomes of birds evolved independently of the eutherian X and Y, and hence birds lack the SRY gene [3]. Like the mammalian X chromosome, the avian Z chromosome is large and gene-rich, while the W, like the mammalian Y, is typically small and largely heterochromatic. The 82 Mb chicken Z chromosome harbours over 1,000 genes and is highly conserved among avians [4, 5], while the W has far fewer genes and appears to have undergone independent degradation across the various avian groups [6, 7]. The exact roles of Z and W genes in avian sex determination remain to be fully resolved. Sex determination may involve a dominant-acting female determinant carried on the female-specific W chromosome, or a Z dosage-based mechanism could prevail [8]. Consistent with the latter, the Z-linked DMRT1 and HEMOGEN genes are involved in testis development in the chicken embryo [9, 10]. However, a potential role for the W sex chromosome in avian sex determination cannot yet be excluded., Attempts to address the potential role of the W chromosome in avian sex determination have been hampered by the poor understanding of this chromosome and its gene content. The chicken W chromosome has an estimated size of approximately 55 Mb, most of which (at least 70%) comprises repetitive elements of the XhoI, EcoR1 and Ssp1 classes [11, 12]. In addition, long arrays of interstitial telomeric sequences have been described on the W. The exact number of genes on the W is obscure. The chicken genome, from a female Red Jungle fowl, was sequenced in 2004 [13] but assembly and annotation of the W has remained incomplete, and it is estimated that only 4% of the chicken W has been mapped [14]. This amounts to approximately 1.2 Mb of assembled sequence on the W in the most recent release of the Chicken genome (Gallus_gallus-4.0; November 2011) [15]. Until recently, around 12 bona fide genes had previously been verified as W-linked, including CHD1W, ATP5A1W, HINTW, UBAP2W, NIPBL, hnRNPW, KCMF, SMAD2, SPIN, MIER3, ZFR and ZNF532 [6, 12, 16–20] (chicken genome release 67, Ensembl) [21]. In a study of W chromosome gene expression in different breeds of chickens, Moghadam and colleagues recently increased the number of putative W genes to 21, with several genes suggested to have multiple copies [22]. However, expression data for these and other W genes at critical time points during embryonic sexual differentiation are lacking., It has recently been proposed that avian sexual differentiation is at least partially cell autonomous. Cell autonomous sexual differentiation would involve purely intrinsic genetic factors, independent of any extrinsic signalling. In contrast, the long-held dogma is that vertebrate sexual differentiation is non-cell autonomous, that is, it does not rely purely on intrinsic factors in the cell and involves some degree of extrinsic signalling. (Sex hormones secreted from the gonads to induce female or male sexual dimorphisms, for example.) Zhao and colleagues (2010) used data from naturally occurring gynandomorphic chickens (birds that are half male and half female) and cross-sex embryonic tissue transplantations to show that sexual differentiation may be cell autonomous, at least partly independent of hormones [23]. This study would predict molecular sexual differentiation (that is, sexually dimorphic gene expression) prior to morphological sexual differentiation (that is, development of testes or ovaries and other sex dimorphisms) (reviewed in [24]). However, large-scale data in support of this hypothesis in avians have not previously been reported in any detail., This study uses RNA sequencing to examine the degree of cell autonomous sexual differentiation in birds and to characterise the W transcriptome in chicken embryos. Comprehensive analysis of gene expression in early embryos reveals significant sexually dimorphic gene expression well prior to gonadal sex differentiation, involving both the sex chromosomes and autosomes. These findings support the idea that avian sexual differentiation is at least partly cell autonomous at the molecular level [23]. Different sets of genes showed sexual dimorphism in chicken blastoderms versus gonads, indicating that distinctive molecular pathways underlying sexual differentiation operate in different tissues. In addition, this analysis has allowed the full characterisation of gene expression from the enigmatic W (female) sex chromosome. Full characterisation of these W transcripts allows definitive comparisons with their Z homologues, shedding light on avian sex determination., This study indicates that cells of the chicken embryo commence sexual differentiation at the molecular level early in development, through sexually dimorphic gene expression from both sex chromosomes and autosomes. This involves the enigmatic W sex chromosome, and it supports recent observations indicating that sexual differentiation may be at least partly cell autonomous in birds. This does not, however, exclude an important role for non-cell autonomous sexual differentiation, which involves hormonal signalling and is clearly very important in birds as it is in all animals. However, the data presented here support the notion that cell autonomous factors are also important, and there is very likely an interaction between both mechanisms to ensure complete and proper phenotypic sexual differentiation., Previous studies have also reported sexually dimorphic gene expression in chicken embryos pre-dating gonadal development [32, 41, 42]. These studies utilised microarrays or subtractive hybridisation to uncover genes regulated in a sex-specific manner prior to gonadal differentiation in the chicken embryo. Our study utilised the earliest time point to date (12 h, stage 1 blastoderms), and has employed the most sensitive and comprehensive method available to assay gene expression. RNA-seq detects all expressed genes, including those that are unannotated, compared to microarray analysis, which only detects sequences arrayed on the microarray [29]. The finding that sexually dimorphic gene expression can pre-date gonadal sex differentiation is not limited to birds, but is likely to be a feature of all animals. Sex differences in gene expression before gonadogenesis have been reported in mouse and bovine embryos [43, 44]., We found that W- and Z-linked genes showing sexually dimorphic expression in blastoderms largely maintained this differential expression profile in the gonads, pointing to a pervasive role for the sex chromosomes in the continuity of cell autonomous sexual development. The sexually dimorphic expression of autosomal genes indicates that female- and male-specific pathways are engaged as early as the blastoderm stage. However, a different set of autosomal genes showed sexually dimorphic expression in the undifferentiated gonads, most notably genes implicated in gonadal development. This indicates that the sex chromosomes activate different sex-specific pathways in different tissues., The mechanism through which the Z and W sex chromosomes act to direct sexual differentiation pathways in early embryos is still unclear. One hypothesis is that the W chromosome carries a dominant-acting female determinant. This could confer 'femaleness' in a cell autonomous fashion early in development, but it may also initiate ovarian differentiation of the gonads at day 4.5. The RNA-seq data presented here has allowed us to draw some conclusions regarding the potential role of the W in avian sex determination. Contrary to previous assumptions, we found that the W is highly transcriptionally active in chicken embryos. Our novel analysis strategy allowed us to construct full-length transcripts for essentially the entire W transcriptome in two tissues. Using these we could correct and expand the annotation of the chicken W, providing complete transcript sequences and open reading frames for almost all 26 genes (Table 1 and Table S3 - Additional file 6). Most of these genes have previously been reported as W-linked in chicken [20, 22]. However, a thorough assessment of expression prior to or during gonadal development has been lacking, and limited sequence analysis has been carried out for these W-linked genes. In addition, we describe here two additional W linked genes and three W-linked small RNAs (Table 1). The assembly of full-length W transcripts described has allowed the accurate comparison of W and Z gametologues, providing key information on the degree of divergence between gene pairs and their relative expression levels. Most of the expressed W genes have open reading frames that are almost or completely homologous to their Z-linked gametologues (Additional file 1, Figure S7), which were also expressed in both blastoderms and gonads. This includes both the known and novel genes identified here. These W and Z genes are therefore likely to be acting as 'de facto autosomal' pairs, and hence almost all W-linked genes are unlikely female sex determinants. Indeed most of these genes encode proteins associated with general functions in the cell, such as ubiquitination, lipid and energy metabolism, and chromosome structure (Table 1). The two exceptions are HINTW, which is divergent from its Z gametologue, and FAF, which lacks a Z gametologue., 
                HINTW (Histidine Triad nucleotide binding, W-linked) is highly expressed in female chicken embryos at the blastoderm and gonadal stages (Table 1) [17]. The high level of HINTW expression in females most likely reflects the multiple copies of HINTW that reside on the chicken W [17]. While an endogenous HINTW protein has yet to be demonstrated, it is predicted to specify an aberrant nucleotide binding protein, lacking a key catalytic domain. The Z-linked copy, HINTZ, encodes a bona fide nucleotide binding protein, mediating the hydrolysis of nucleoside monophosphates [17] and it is hypothesised that HINTW may operate in a dominant negative fashion, blocking the function of HINTZ [8, 45]. While experimental over-expression of HINTW mRNA fails to alter male development in chicken embryos [46], the potential role of HINTW in avian sex determination requires closer examination. One W-linked transcript detected in our screen did not have a Z gametologue; FAF (Female Associated Factor) [23]. The FAF gene product shows no clear homology to known proteins and its potential role in sexual differentiation is not clear at this stage., The same set of W-linked genes expressed in female blastoderms was also expressed in E4.5 female gonads, yet a different set of autosomal genes was expressed. Therefore, if W-linked genes play a role in female development, they must engage different pathways in the different tissues. In the developing female gonad, a putative ovary determinant would directly or indirectly activate expression of the key FOXL2 gene, which is thought to then activate CYP19A1 and hence the oestrogen synthesis that is central to ovarian differentiation. Since we detected female enriched FOXL2 expression already in E4.5 gonads, the direct activator of this gene must also be present in our E4.5 female dataset (Additional file 5). This requires further analysis., The alternative mechanism mediating avian sex determination involves Z-gene dosage. As there is no global Z chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, a sex determining mechanism may rely upon Z gene dosage inequality between the sexes. One or more non-dosage compensated Z-linked genes could direct sexual differentiation in individual cells. Our findings indicate that like the W, many Z-linked genes show sexually dimorphic expression that does not differ between the tissues assayed, with only 1% showing significantly different levels of dimorphic expression between the two tissues. This indicates that the sex chromosome influence sexual differentiation in cells, but this does not explain how sex-linked genes could then trigger sexually dimorphic expression of different autosomal genes in each tissue. Many Z- and W- linked genes showed different average expression levels between tissues (Figure 1D), and therefore while female: male ratios may not differ, changes in total expression levels may play a role in each tissue. For example, the Z-linked testis-associated genes, DMRT1 and HEMOGEN, are more highly expressed in the gonads compared to the blastoderms. Therefore it is possible that additional Z-linked genes may play a role in sexual differentiation in different tissues through changes in their relative expression. It is noteworthy in this regard that many Z-linked genes with sexually dimorphic expression in the gonads were sex-related (Additional file 5). Previous studies have reported a clear bias for genes associated with sex and reproduction located on the avian Z sex chromosome [47, 48], making sex determination via Z dosage and expression levels an attractive model., It has recently been hypothesised that multiple parallel pathways leading to sexual differentiation probably exist in mammalian embryos [49]. Similarly, in birds, molecular pathways controlling sexual differentiation in a cell autonomous fashion in the early embryo would be different to those operating specifically to induce ovarian versus testicular development at later stages. This idea is supported by our findings that different sets of autosomal genes show sexually dimorphic expression in the blastoderm compared to the E4.5 embryonic gonad. It is noted, however, that ultimately, proper sexual differentiation must involve the interaction of both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous factors. Despite the advances brought by this research, the exact mechanism underlying avian sex determination is still unclear., The data reported here show sexually dimorphic gene expression in chicken blastoderms and gonads prior to gonadal sex differentiation. This supports the notion that sexual differentiation begins at the molecular level in a cell autonomous manner in the chicken embryo. This involves both sex-linked and autosomal genes, with different sets of genes being expressed in the two tissues, demonstrating the engagement of different sexually dimorphic pathways. While sexually dimorphic gene expression from the Z and W sex chromosomes does not dramatically differ between developmental stages, we show that significant differences in average levels of expression of sex-linked genes may be responsible for activation of different signalling pathways in a tissue specific manner. Furthermore, we comprehensively define the W chromosome transcriptome for two early embryonic tissues, annotating W genes and providing complete open reading frames for most genes, and characterising two novel W-linked genes and several small RNAs."

Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting. However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear., By genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells. Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 from Polycomb target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters. Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression., An intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 targeting. These observations identify a previously unappreciated role for DNA methylation in gene regulation and therefore influence our understanding of how this epigenetic mechanism contributes to normal development and disease.","DNA methylation, H3K27me3, Polycomb, PRC2, regulation of transcription","Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and the Polycomb repressor system, play key roles in maintaining transcriptional states that are initially established by transcription factor networks [1, 2]. A major challenge of molecular biology is to understand how epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the precise temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression that are required for multicellular life, and how the malfunction of these mechanisms contributes to human disease., DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group to position 5 of the pyrimidine ring of the cytosine base, a reaction catalyzed by a family of DNA methyltransferase enzymes [1]. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs predominantly in the sequence context of 5′-CG-3′ (CpG) [3, 4]. Vertebrates possess a so-called global methylome, as in most tissues, the majority of cytosines in the CpG context are found in the methylated state (5mCpG) [3, 5]. The high level of CpG methylation found in the bulk genome is punctuated by short stretches of CpG- and GC-rich sequences, known as CpG islands, that are normally infrequently methylated and are associated with a large proportion of gene promoters [1, 3, 6]. Despite this general bimodality, DNA methylation patterns are variable between cells of different tissues, and dynamic during cell differentiation, a feature thought to contribute to the maintenance of a cell's transcriptional state [3–5, 7]. At gene promoters that contain sufficient CpG density, abundant 5mCpG is associated with transcriptional repression [8]. This canonical regulatory role for DNA methylation contributes to the monoallelic repression of imprinted genes [9], the stable repression of large regions of the inactive X-chromosome in female cells [10], and the tissue-specific repression of a relatively small number of single copy genes [11, 12]. For example, promoter DNA methylation is utilized in somatic cells to maintain repression of genes that are expressed in the germline [13–15]. DNA methylation is able to contribute to the maintenance of transcription states over time and cell divisions through two main properties. Firstly, patterns of 5mCpG are copied to the nascent strand during replication of DNA in a process requiring the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1 [1]. This property means that patterns of 5mCpG are stable over cell division. Secondly, CpG and 5mCpG are differentially bound by various DNA- and/or chromatin-binding proteins, many of which have key roles in transcriptional regulation [1, 16]. Several of these proteins are either directly or indirectly involved in further chromatin modification, leading to the idea that DNA methylation acts as a template to direct the establishment or reinforcement of chromatin states. For example, 5mCpG is specifically recognized by methyl-CpG-binding proteins, a number of which are associated with histone deacetylases and other histone-modifying enzymes [1, 17, 18]. By contrast, unmodified CpG is recognized by proteins such as the histone lysine demethylase Kdm2a, and Cfp1, a protein that recruits a Setd1 H3K4 methyltransferase complex [19, 20]. Despite advances in this area, our understanding of how DNA methylation contributes to chromatin states, and how these states influence gene regulation, is far from complete., Polycomb group proteins form multi-protein chromatin-associated complexes that act as repressors of thousands of genes, many of which have key functions in embryonic development and cell-fate decisions [21–24]. The Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) modifies chromatin structure by depositing tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) via its catalytic Ezh2/Ezh1 subunit [2, 25]. The H3K27me3 mark is therefore considered a hallmark of PRC2-mediated repression [2]. Like DNA methylation, H3K27me3 is propagated through cell divisions, a process mediated by the ability of the PRC2 complex to bind to H3K27me3 [26, 27]. Evidence suggests that H3K27me3 and PRC2 lead to transcriptional silencing in multiple ways, including the recruitment of a subset of Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) protein complexes that recognize the H3K27me3 mark and induce chromatin compaction [2, 28, 29]., In the last few years it has emerged that considerable cross-talk exists between the DNA methylation and Polycomb repression systems, demonstrating that these two epigenetic mechanisms are intimately linked. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that DNA methylation is a negative modulator of PRC2-chromatin interactions. Firstly, methylation-free CpG islands have been linked to the recruitment of the PRC2 complex [30–32]. Secondly, epigenome mapping studies have found a negative correlation between DNA methylation and H3K27me3 patterns in normal [3, 5, 7, 33] and cancer [34, 35] tissues, implying exclusivity of the two marks in mammalian genomes. A similar observation has been made in plant tissues, implying deep conservation of this relationship [36]. It should be noted that, in mammals, a negative correlation between DNA methylation and H3K27me3 is restricted to relatively CpG-rich regions of the genome, whereas the two marks co-occupy many CpG-poor regions [37, 38]. The idea of exclusivity is supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that PRC2 shows attenuated binding and/or activity on DNA methylated chromatin, suggesting that 5mC directly influences PRC2-chromatin interactions [39, 40]. Importantly, when DNA methylation patterns are experimentally perturbed, H3K27me3 patterns are altered [32, 33, 37, 39]. For example, in mouse embryonic stem cells that are hypomethylated due to lack of DNA methyltransferases, new domains of H3K27me3 form at genomic regions that are normally highly DNA methylated in wild-type cells [22, 32]. Also, in hypomethylated mouse embryonic stem cells, H3K27me3 is reduced at regions where it is normally abundant in wild-type cells [37]., Collectively, these studies have demonstrated that DNA methylation plays a role in ensuring correct genomic targeting of the PRC2 complex and hence the distribution of the H3K27me3 mark on chromatin. However, it is unknown if this function of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation. We reasoned that perturbations in DNA methylation may lead to altered patterns of transcription due to redistribution of the repressive activity of the PRC2 complex and the H3K27me3 mark. To test this hypothesis, we generated genome-wide profiles of H3K27me3, gene expression and DNA methylation in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells. Our results uncover an unexpected relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional repression by Polycomb. We suggest that, through facilitating correct PRC2-targeting, an intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression., We have uncovered an unexpected link between DNA methylation and PRC2-mediated gene repression. An intact DNA methylome is required to restrict PRC2-function to its normal gene targets. Where DNA methylation levels are reduced in somatic cells, either genetically or by pharmacological inhibition, many Polycomb target genes lose their association with PRC2 and H3K27me3, and become ectopically expressed., How Polycomb complexes are targeted to specific regions of the mammalian genome is a major question [44]. Here, we followed multiple lines of evidence that implicated DNA methylation as a player in this process. In severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we found that H3K27me3 was redistributed in a manner that reflected the DNA methylation pattern in wild-type cells. Increased H3K27me3 occurred at many regions of the genome that are normally highly DNA methylated, consistent with the idea that DNA methylation is capable of attenuating PRC2 binding in certain genomic contexts. This finding is consistent with recently published studies that investigate patterns of H3K27me3 in hypomethylated mouse ES cells, but also suggests that this may be a function of the DNA methylome in lineage committed, in addition to pluripotent, cell types [32, 37]. Importantly, we also observed decreased H3K27me3 at a large number of normal Polycomb targets that are associated with low-level DNA methylation in wild-type cells. We suggest the following model to account for both features of H3K27me3 redistribution in hypomethylated cells (Figure 7). Upon hypomethylation, DNA methylation-mediated repression of PRC2 binding is lost, allowing increased PRC2 binding and H3K27me3 modification at inappropriate genomic loci. These regions are associated with high levels of DNA methylation in wild-type cells where DNA methylation inhibits PRC2 binding. We suggest that this leads to a dilution of PRC2 away from its normal targets (Figure 7). This idea is supported by recent work using hypomethylated ES cells, where decreased H3K27me3 was observed at regions that are marked by discrete peaks of H3K27me3 in wild-type cells, and new domains of H3K27me3 are formed at ectopic locations [37]. This model makes the assumption that the amount of the PRC2 complex is limiting in these cells. We speculate that the cell must maintain appropriate levels of this complex to avoid the aberrant repression of transcription at non-target loci. This model explains the general loss of H3K27me3 that we observed from its normal target promoters, and the strong association between DNA methylation patterns and H3K27me3 changes upon hypomethylation. Further work will be required to test this hypothesis and to further define the mechanism behind the H3K27me3 redistribution observed upon loss of DNA methylation, and its consequences for gene regulation [49].

                        A model for de-repression of Polycomb target genes upon loss of DNA methylation. In normal cells, PRC2 is targeted to chromatin in a process that involves unmethylated stretches of DNA, such as CpG islands (PRC2 targeting is indicated by green arrows). DNA methylation has a negative effect on PRC2 binding to chromatin and so constrains PRC2 targeting. When global DNA methylation levels are reduced, PRC2 binding and H3K27me3 increase at numerous additional genomic loci leading to a dilution of available PRC2 from its normal targets. Note that only loci that are somehow permissive to PRC2 binding show increased H3K27me3 in hypomethylated cells. Reduced PRC2 binding to its normal target promoters results in loss of transcriptional repression. PRC2, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2.
                    , The molecular mechanism behind DNA methylation-mediated attenuation of PRC2-chromatin interactions is not yet known. In vitro experiments using reconstituted PRC2 and chromatin suggest that one or more PRC2 components are capable of directly differentiating CpG from 5mCpG [39]. PRC2 is thought to bind to chromatin through several DNA and histone interactions [2]. DNA methylation may be interpreted by one or more individual subunits of PRC2, or by the complex as a whole in response to a structural change of chromatin induced by DNA methylation. Several PRC2 components contain zinc finger domains that could potentially mediate this effect, as the DNA binding of certain zinc finger domains, such as CXXC domains, are directly inhibited by DNA methylation [2, 19, 20]., We did not observe increased H3K27me3 in hypomethylated cells at all regions of the genome that are highly DNA methylated in normal cells. This would be expected to occur if the DNA methylation pattern was the sole determinant of H3K27me3 targeting. Rather, this observation is further proof that DNA methylation is merely one of multiple signals that the cell uses to correctly position the H3K27me3 mark in the genome. This is consistent with other studies demonstrating the importance of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins [44], transcription [31], non-coding RNA [50] and other chromatin features [51] in the targeting of H3K27me3. The final distribution of H3K27me3 is therefore likely the result of the concerted action of these multiple mechanisms. Future studies, taking into account DNA sequence, RNA, and epigenetic modulators of PRC2-binding will help to advance our understanding of this complex problem., Importantly, we observed that loss of promoter H3K27me3 in DNA hypomethylated somatic cells was associated with transcriptional activation, consistent with a loss of Polycomb-mediated repression. This suggests that an intact DNA methylome is indirectly required for the normal repression of PRC2-target genes. This unexpected finding significantly widens the scope for genes that require DNA methylation for their repression. Owing to their low level of promoter DNA methylation, these genes would not normally be associated with repression that involves DNA methylation. Many of these genes are classic Polycomb targets, such as the Hox genes, and have known functions in embryonic development and cell-fate specification. In fact, Hox gene regulation has been previously linked to DNA methylation, but the underlying role of DNA methylation in this process has remained unclear. Firstly, mice with hypomorphic mutations in the DNA methyltransferase gene Dnmt3b display homeotic transformations of the posterior axis, concomitant with de-repression of certain HoxA genes [14]. Secondly, loss of the Lsh protein leads to DNA hypomethylation and mis-expression of certain Hox genes in mouse embryos and cell lines [52]. The findings presented in our study provide an alternative explanation for Hox gene de-repression upon hypomethylation, even when the gene of interest is not associated with a highly DNA methylated promoter. It should be noted that our knowledge of DNA methylation patterns within Hox clusters is incomplete. Hox cluster DNA methylation appears to vary in a complex tissue- and cluster-specific manner, but the CpG-rich regions associated with Hox gene promoters appear to remain in an unmethylated state in most tissues studied [3–6]. Indeed, in our study, we observed that the CpG-rich promoters of the Hox genes studied contained low levels of DNA methylation in MEFs, suggesting that their de-repression was not caused by loss of promoter DNA methylation. However, at this point we cannot completely exclude a role for promoter DNA methylation in the repression of these genes. We also note that Hox gene expression patterns in fibroblasts are dependent on their anatomic location, and that these patterns are maintained when fibroblasts are grown in culture [53]. Importantly, we have shown that DNA hypomethylation induced in Dnmt1
                +/+
                 MEFs results in de-repression of Hox genes. This experiment compares the same starting population of cells, excluding the possibility that the observed gene expression differences are due to differential anatomic origin of the samples. However, we note that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the severe mis-expression of Hox genes observed in Dnmt1
                -/-
                 MEFs was further enhanced by a potential differential anatomic origin of these cells. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that loss of DNA methylation by itself is sufficient to induce de-repression of Hox genes., Our observations could also offer an explanation for the enigmatic de-repression of PRC2-target developmental genes in cells of patients with immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial abnormalities (ICF) syndrome, a disorder frequently caused by mutation in DNMT3B [54]. A subset of PRC2-target genes that are associated with CpG-rich DNA methylation-free promoters were observed to be upregulated in cells of patients with ICF syndrome relative to controls [54]. It is feasible that DNMT3B-mutation induced DNA hypomethylation elsewhere in the genome drives reduction in PRC2 and H3K27me3 occupancy at these gene promoters, resulting in leaky repression. Our observations may also influence our understanding of the phenotypes of Dnmt1 loss in embryonic development and in multipotent stem cell populations, such as hematopoietic stem cells, where the phenotypes observed are compatible with mis-regulation of cell-fate specifying genes [41, 55–57]., The findings presented in this study, along with others, demonstrate that DNA methylation is a major factor in determining PRC2 targeting in mouse cells. Different aspects of the DNA methylome appear to have been lost during the evolution of certain branches of organisms [58, 59]. Some, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, have lost CpG methylation entirely [59] and, in this organism, DNA-binding transcription factors play an important role in Polycomb targeting by binding to sequence elements called Polycomb response elements (PREs) [44]. The search for PREs in mammals so far has yielded few results [44]. It is interesting to speculate that without the restrictive activity of DNA methylation, Drosophila may rely more heavily on a PRE approach for Polycomb targeting. In support of this speculation, mapping of Polycomb components by ChIP in Drosophila has shown that, with the exception of Pc, which binds H3K27me3, Polycomb components are bound in punctate regions at PREs [44]. This is in contrast to mammals where PRC2 components are bound in more broad domains that are better associated with H3K27me3 domains [44]. We speculate that these differences could have arisen as a need to restrict PRC2 binding in Drosophila in the absence of CpG methylation., Both DNA methylation and H3K27me3 patterns are dynamic during cell differentiation [3–5, 7, 45] and it remains to be investigated whether DNA methylation dynamics play a direct role in determining changes in H3K27me3 patterns upon lineage commitment. In this respect, loss of DNA methylation from specific loci during ES cell differentiation has been correlated with increased H3K27me3 [7]. A similar hypothesis could be addressed in various cancers, where dramatic alterations in DNA methylation are often observed (for example, [60]). Frequent observations in cancers are DNA hypomethylation of large genomic domains and hypermethylation of CpG islands. It will be intriguing to investigate the effect of DNA methylation redistribution on PRC2 targeting in cancer cells, and its effect on gene expression. Indeed, new domains of H3K27me3 have been observed in breast cancer cell lines in regions that become DNA hypomethylated [35]. Also, loss of H3K27me3 has been observed at promoters that become DNA hypermethylated in a prostate cancer cell line, consistent with the idea that DNA methylation changes can drive alteration of PRC2-chromatin interactions in cancer [34]., We suggest that the DNA methylome has an unexpected role in the repression of Polycomb target genes, as it is essential for appropriate targeting of PRC2 and the H3K27me3 histone modification in mouse somatic cells. These findings significantly advance our understanding of how DNA methylation influences chromatin states and highlights the diverse ways that this epigenetic mark contributes to genome regulation."

Patchwork can be used to determine the copy number of homologous sequences throughout the genome, even in aneuploid samples with moderate sequence coverage and tumor cell content. No prior knowledge of average ploidy or tumor cell content is required. Patchwork is freely available as an R package, installable via R-Forge (http://​patchwork.​r-forge.​r-project.​org/​)., Cancer is a disease in which somatic mutations lead to loss of proliferation control [1]. Genomic aberrations range from single-nucleotide mutations to copy number changes of sets of chromosomes, and can be recurrent in genomic regions, individual genes, and molecular pathways [2]. The number and complexity of genomic aberrations vary greatly between the different types of cancer. Recent large-scale studies have summarized the current knowledge in a genome-wide perspective [3–8]., Copy number aberrations affect both large and small portions of the genome. Methods such as spectral karyotyping (SKY) and comparative genome hybridization have provided progressively more detailed information on copy number aberrations [9–11]. With the introduction of high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays it is possible to obtain allele-specific information on a genome-wide scale [9, 12]. Specialized software tools such as GAP (Genome Alteration Print), ASCAT (Allele-Specific Copy number Analysis of Tumors), and TAPS (Tumor Aberration Prediction Suite) were developed to use the allele-specific information to address issues such as aneuploidy and admixture of normal cells that complicate the analysis in tumor samples [13–15]. These tools provide allele-specific copy number analysis (ASCNA), that is, analysis of the absolute number of each homologous copy., ASCNA can help identify the genotype of the amplified or deleted copy, which may have a direct implication on the tumor phenotype. Studies have shown that there may be preferential amplification of certain alleles in human tumors [16, 17]. Perhaps more importantly, ASCNA helps interpret other somatic alterations, specifically point mutations. For example, if loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is detected in a region with a recessive mutation in a cancer-related gene, we can suspect a likely effect on tumor biology. ASCNA also facilitates reconstruction of the timing of mutational events through tumor development [2, 18]., Recent advances in second-generation sequencing and data analysis are promoting whole-genome sequencing as an 'all-in-one' analysis for cancer genomes. Using whole-genome sequencing combined with bioinformatic tools it is possible to characterize an entire genome at base-pair resolution using a single molecular assay [19]. Several methods are available for copy number analysis of whole-genome sequencing data, but these do not provide absolute ASCNA [20, 21]. Although tools that account for normal cell content have begun to emerge for whole-genome sequencing data [22], there is currently none that works without prior knowledge of the average ploidy. In this paper, we describe Patchwork, a tool for ASCNA of whole-genome sequencing data from tumor tissue. We found that performance was comparable with array-based methods in terms of resolution, sensitivity, and specificity, even with modest sequence coverage and thus this techniquie may obviate the need for copy number analysis based on SNP arrays., ASCNA with Patchwork is based on the same principles as TAPS, which was developed for SNP array data [15]. Quantitative information on total and allele-specific DNA content is obtained for genomic segments, and visualized in relation to all segments in the genome. The observed pattern is used to estimate absolute copy numbers and purity, and to determine input parameters for automatic calling of allele-specific copy numbers., Patchwork segments the genome based on total DNA content (normalized sequence coverage) using circular binary segmentation (CBS) [23]. For each segment, allele-specific information is used to estimate the relative abundance of the two homologous copies. Unless sequenced in great depth, it is unfeasible to obtain such an estimate from the allelic read counts of single SNPs. The actual coverage at a SNP is affected not only by copy number, but by sequence bias and random sampling, and therefore varies greatly from average coverage. However, along a segment containing many SNPs, a reliable measure of allelic imbalance can be achieved, even in samples with low coverage. In Patchwork, the allelic imbalance ratio of a genomic segment is calculated as
                    
              , where ∑low and ∑high are the number of reads with lower and higher observed allele counts summed over all heterozygous SNPs in the segment. Using sums of observed reads means that effectively each SNP is weighted according to its coverage, maximizing the use of the information. The allelic imbalance ratio and normalized coverage are plotted against each other for each genomic segment. Clusters of segments share allele-specific copy number. The allelic copy number compositions that emerge at different coverage levels can be used to discern the absolute copy numbers and, thereby, the average ploidy of the tumor cells. Figure 1 illustrates the steps undertaken by Patchwork to process input data into interpretable figures and allele-specific copy numbers.

                        Patchwork flowchart. 1) Sequenced reads are aligned to the genome. 2) Single-nucleotide (and optionally short indel) variants that do not match the reference genome are extracted. 3) Systematic bias is removed by normalizing for GC content and other position-related effects. Coverage information from one or more diploid samples sequenced with the same method is used in this process. 4) The genome is segmented, based on the normalized coverage. 5) Informative heterozygous variants are identified. 6) Allelic imbalance ratio is calculated for each segment. 7) Visualization of allelic imbalance ratio and normalized coverage for genomic segments. 8) Manual interpretation of visualization to obtain input parameters for next step. 9) Allele-specific copy number is calculated for all genomic segments. Steps 3 to 7 and 9 are handled by the Patchwork.plot() and Patchwork.copynumbers() modules respectively.
                    , Patchwork can be used with any sequencing technology capable of producing SAM (Sequence alignment/map)-formatted aligned reads, which includes the most common sequencers from Roche, Illumina, and Life Technologies. In addition, ASM (assembly)-formatted data from Complete Genomics can be used directly in a version of Patchwork called PatchworkCG (Figure 1). A patient-matched normal sample or a reference file based on diploid samples sequenced with a similar technology is required. Reference files for Illumina/Solexa and Life Technologies/Solid are available with Patchwork. Users also have the option to build their own reference files from aligned reads obtained with their technology of choice., Many studies have shown that analysis of copy numbers and LOH is an important part of genome characterization in cancer, and that DNA microarrays are suitable for the task. Bioinformatic tools capable of ASCNA of cancer genomes have been available for SNP array data for some time, but tools for whole-genome sequencing data have lagged behind. With Patchwork, we have developed a tool with which whole-genome sequencing, even at modest sequence coverage, can be used for ASCNA of cancer genomes., Funding support for the breast-cancer primary tumor, metastasis and xenograft sequence data was provided by grants from Washington University in St. Louis and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI U54 HG003079), the National Cancer Institute (NCI 1 U01 CA114722-01), the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation (BCTR0707808), and the Fashion Footwear Charitable Foundation, Inc.

"168","Go retro and get a GRIP","Kim Wong, David J Adams, Thomas M Keane","Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute","David J Adams","da1@sanger.ac.uk","19 March 2013","","","Gene retrocopy insertions are a source of new genes and new gene functions, and can now be identified using paired-end whole genome sequencing data., How many GRIPs are there in vertebrate genomes? To address this question, Ewing and colleagues developed GRIPper, a software tool that detects gene retrocopy insertions by finding distinct discordant mapping patterns from paired-end sequence data. GRIPper identifies clusters of mapped reads for which corresponding mate pairs are mapped discordantly to the exons of a source gene; this strategy is similar to that used previously to find non-reference retroelement insertions in human and mouse genomes [6, 7]. To add further confidence to their calls, the authors carried out a local de novo assembly around candidate breakpoints at GRIP insertions. Using whole-genome sequencing data from a subset of individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project, 10 chimpanzee genomes from the PanMap project and 17 mouse genomes from the Mouse Genomes Project, GRIPper was used to catalog a collection of 48 distinct GRIPs in humans, 19 GRIPs in chimpanzees and 755 GRIPs in mice., The 48 gene retrocopies found in humans were identified in subsets of 1,024 individuals, indicating that these events are polymorphic. As expected for a heritable genomic polymorphism, a number of the GRIPs are restricted to individuals from defined geographical areas. The authors estimate a rate of 1 novel heritable GRIP per 5,177 individuals, which is comparable to the rate of 1 novel heritable GRIP in 6,804 individuals in the chimpanzee. In the mouse, where the 17 genomes analyzed by GRIPper span approximately 2 million years of evolution, between 100 and 200 GRIPs were found in the wild-derived inbred strains, which are most divergent from the reference, while on average only 56 were found in the genomes of the common laboratory strains, which are largely Mus musculus domesticus-derived. The sharing of GRIPs largely recapitulated the ancestral origins of these mice., To determine whether gene retrocopy insertions also occur in the soma, Ewing and colleagues examined data from six cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Intriguingly, by comparing tumor samples with their matched normal samples, evidence of somatic gene retrocopy insertions for three genes was revealed., What are the functional characteristics of GRIP source genes? Predictably, the genes that are the source of pseudogenes, gene copies already present in the reference genome that have lost their protein-coding capacity or are otherwise no longer expressed in the cell, overlap with those for new GRIPs., In particular, highly and widely expressed genes with ribosomal functions, genes involved in metabolic processes, signal transduction genes and transcriptional regulators are enriched as source genes for GRIPs. This may suggest that gene expression levels or possibly transcript stability may influence the likelihood that extra copies of a gene are inserted into the genome as a GRIP., Importantly, several of the source genes of GRIPs found in the human genomes analyzed are known to have multiple copies elsewhere in the reference genome. For example, POLR2C, HSPE1 and SNRPC (encoding an RNA polymerase II component, a heat shock protein and a component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, respectively) are GRIPs in persons of African descent, and COX7C (a cytochrome c oxidase gene), NACC1 (a transcription factor gene) and three ribosomal genes, RPL22, RPS2 and RPL37A, are GRIPs in persons of Chinese/Japanese descent. Intriguingly, RNA interference knockdown experiments have revealed potential roles for several of these genes, namely POLR2C, HSPE1 and SNRPC, in cell viability, and for NACC1 in the cell cycle [8]. RPS2 and RPL37A knockdown experiments have also revealed important roles for these genes in fundamental biological processes. For example, knockdown of RPL37A has been linked to nucleolar pre-40S maturation defects, 60S biogenesis defects and decreased viability [8]. Thus, the source genes for GRIPs also appear to be enriched for essential genes., In cancers, several genes were found to be retrotransposed insertions, including MYH11, encoding a major contractile protein, and GAS5, encoding a regulator of growth arrest. The high similarity of retrotransposed elements to their source genes may provide a mechanism for amplification of oncogene dosage. Indeed, MYH11 fusions with the gene CBFB (core binding factor B) are found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where they are particularly associated with a distinct clinical subclass of the disease called M4Eo [9]. In addition to dysregulation of CBFB, which is known to be a key aspect of M4Eo, dysregulation of MYH11 may also contribute to M4Eo leukemogenesis. One possible mechanism for this is the association between myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11) and histone deacetylase complex subunit Sin3a (mSin3A), a subunit of the corepressor complex, and with histone deacetylases, an event that has been linked to the repression of runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1)-mediated gene regulation [9]. Dysfunction of MYH11 has also been linked to other types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Since GAS5, which is a non-coding RNA gene, is critical for the normal growth arrest of both leukemic and untransformed human T lymphocytes, it also has potential as a cancer driver gene [10]. Since GAS5 is important for the inhibitory effects of the chemotherapeutic rapamycin, somatic alterations of this gene might have important implications for therapy. Thus, somatic retrocopy insertions may represent an important yet underappreciated contributor to cancer evolution., With the help of GRIPper and the catalog of variants described in this study, we can begin to examine how evolution of humans and other species has been affected by gene retrotransposition, and to what extent GRIPs contribute to adaptive evolution. Now that it is possible to catalog somatic retrocopy insertions in cancer samples, functional studies to determine the contribution of these mutations to tumorigenesis may also be performed. Looking ahead, it is clear that software such as GRIPer should be included in the toolkit used by analysts to catalog structural variation in eukaryotes."

Despite the relative abundance of non-frameshifting indels, their damaging effect on protein structure and function has gone largely unstudied. We have developed a support vector machine-based method named DDIG-in (Detecting disease-causing genetic variations due to indels) to prioritize non-frameshifting indels by comparing disease-associated mutations with putatively neutral mutations from the 1,000 Genomes Project. The final model gives good discrimination for indels and is robust against annotation errors. A webserver implementing DDIG-in is available at http://​sparks-lab.​org/​ddig., The largest class of human gene mutation is the single nucleotide variant (SNV) which comprises approximately 67% of known pathological mutations [1]. This is followed by microinsertions and microdeletions (micro-indels of ≤20 bp) which together comprise approximately 22% of known pathological mutations [2]. In addition, with the broad implementation of next generation sequencing technology in genetic studies, several million polymorphic micro-indels have been identified and analyzed in the human genome [3–7]. Many more genetic variants, including micro-indels, are currently being discovered at an unprecedented rate. Obviously, it is impractical to examine the impact of each variant on biological function individually. Hence, there is a critical need for effective bioinformatics tools that are capable of distinguishing potentially disease-causing variants from those that are functionally neutral., Most available tools for prioritizing genetic variants are however limited to non-synonymous SNVs. Examples are SIFT [8], POLYPHEN [9], and MutPred [10] (for recent reviews, see [11–15]). These tools are not however applicable to indels because indels change the number of nucleotides in the gene and hence may be expected to have a much greater impact on molecular function than single nucleotide substitutions. There are two main types of indel within exons: frameshifting (FS) and non-frameshifting (NFS). NFS-indels insert/delete multiples of three nucleotides leading to the addition or removal of specific amino-acid residues at the indel site. FS-indels, on the other hand, insert/delete a discrete number of nucleotides that are indivisible by three and therefore alter the entire reading frame resulting in either a completely different amino-acid sequence C-terminal to the indel site, or premature termination of translation. Two bioinformatics methods were recently designed to discriminate between functional and non-functional FS-indels [16, 17] and nonsense mutations (premature stop codons) [16]. However, to our knowledge, there is no technique available that is capable of analyzing NFS-indels. Methods for interrogating FS-indels would not be applicable to NFS-indels because FS-indels modify the entire amino-acid sequence C-terminal to the indel site (unless a second indel were to exist), whereas NFS-indels simply alter the amino-acid sequence at the indel site. Such a technique for NFS-indel prioritization is urgently required because NFS-indels constitute a significant fraction of all exonic indels (theoretically, it is about one-third). In practice, we found that only 26% of 9,327 exonic micro-indels are NFS indels in the 1,000 Genomes Project data [18]., In this paper, we have developed a method that we have termed DDIG-in (Detecting DIsease-causing Genetic variants due to microinsertions/microdeletions) to prioritize NFS-indels by comparing disease-causing indels from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) [1] with putatively neutral NFS-indels from the 1,000 Genomes Project [18], respectively. We developed and examined a total of 58 sequence- and structure-based features of indel sites and found that the feature based on predicted unstructured regions by disorder predictor SPINE-D [19] was the most discriminating one. This feature can, on its own, achieve a value of 0.56 for the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and 0.82 for the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). We developed two separate support vector machines (SVM) methods for NFS-microdeletions and NFS-microinsertions that were 10-fold cross-validated and independently tested on microinsertions and microdeletions, respectively. A similar level of accuracy between independent testing and 10-fold cross-validation indicates not only the robustness of our training procedure but also a similar deleterious impact of NFS microdeletions and microinsertions. Of the 58 features tested (listed in Table 1), nine features were selected by maximizing the discriminatory roles for detecting disease-causing NFS microinsertions and microdeletions in a non-redundant dataset of micro-indels. Our DDIG-in method received further confirmation from the observation that NFS-indel variants with higher predicted disease-causing probabilities were characterized by lower average minor allele frequencies in the general population (based on data from the 1,000 Genomes Project).Table 1
                      List of all features considered.

The method is based on nucleotide and amino-acid sequences and predicted structural features of proteins. The result suggests that highly accurate and robust prediction for both microinsertions and microdeletions can be made with only nine features. They are minimum disorder score, maximum DNA conservation score, the indel-induced change to the HMM alignment score, minimum effective number of aligned sequence to amino acids, average ASA, microinsertion/microdeletion length, maximum ASA, maximum HHBlits match-to-match transition probability, and average DNA conservation score. Interestingly, predicted ASA and DNA conservation are employed twice, once as the average value and a second time as the maximum value for the entire NFS-indel region. The difference between these two ASA or DNA conservation features measures the fluctuation of ASA or conservation for the indel region. The method was examined by 10-fold cross-validation as well as by an independent test. The consistency between 10-fold cross-validations and independent tests (84-85% for accuracy, 0.88-0.90 for AUC) supports the robustness of the final method developed., One point to consider is that the most discriminating feature was predicted disordered (or structured) regions by SPINE-D. As Table 2 shows, the disorder feature alone can achieve an MCC value of 0.56 for both microinsertions and microdeletions. Although predicted disorder probabilities have previously been found to be useful in SNP discrimination [10, 25], with disease-causing missense mutations being shown to be less likely to occur within disordered regions [26], its importance has never before been shown to be so prominent. This is probably due, at least in part, to the improvement of SPINE-D over previous algorithms [19]. It may also suggest the uniqueness of NFS-indel classification. This result is not unexpected because fully disordered regions (disorder probability, approximately 1) are structurally flexible and hence more permissive of modification by microinsertion or microdeletion as long as functional residues within the disordered regions remain intact. Indeed, we found that binding sites at intrinsically disordered regions of proteins are often located in semi-disordered regions (regions with a disorder probability of approximately 0.5) [27], consistent with near equal probability of disease-causing or neutral NFS-indels at disorder probability of approximately 0.5 in Figure 1., Here, we assumed from the outset that the microdeletion and microinsertion variants identified during the course of the 1,000 Genomes Project are neutral. Although this assumption is not unreasonable, it should be appreciated that the training set may contain false negatives, especially for some late-onset disorders. To examine the effect of this, we removed those neutral variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of <2% and examined the effect of the removal of those variants on the accuracy and training of our NFS-indel discriminatory tool. This yielded 1,609 neutral cases plus 2,207 positive cases from the non-redundant set. The 10-fold cross-validation with the same nine features, but retrained without indels with a MAF of <2%, yielded an MCC of 0.70, an accuracy of 85%, and an AUC of 0.883. By comparison, application of the original nine-feature model (trained with neutral indels with a MAF of <2%) to the set of neutral indels without a MAF of <2% yielded an MCC of 0.74, an accuracy of 87%, and an AUC of 0.92. The fact that the nine-feature model trained without MAF <2% indels was less accurate than the nine-feature model trained with MAF <2% indels suggests that including MAF <2% indels (which potentially contained false negatives) facilitated machine learning. In other words, potential false negatives within the small frequency putatively neutral NFS-indels did not adversely affect SVM training. This is supported by strong negative correlations between the MAF and the disease-causing probability (Figure 3)., To further examine the effect of potential annotation errors in our datasets, we randomly introduced 5% or 10% errors to nine-folds by assigning neutral to disease-causing and disease-causing to neutral indels and testing the method for the remaining one fold. This was repeated 10 times. We also randomly introduced 5% or 10% errors 10 separate times to obtain an average effect. As described above, the 10-fold cross-validation with the same nine features (Table 3) but retrained without indels with a MAF of <2% yielded an MCC of 0.696. Adding 5% and 10% errors to nine training folds yielded the average MCC values for the test set of 0.684 and 0.674, respectively. This small change in MCC values due to 5% to 10% errors confirms that our method is robust against potential assignment errors in the training set., Another way to examine the robustness of a method is to test its dependence on various parameters. Figure 4 shows the Matthews correlation coefficient as a function of SVM gamma and cost parameters and the half-window size for the NFS-indel dataset for the case when all features were employed. It shows that MCC values change a little for the entire range of nwindow from 0 to 7 and for a large range of gamma and cost parameters.

Note that a logarithmic scale is used for gamma and cost parameters and log2(gamma) and log2(cost) are shifted to facilitate comparison.
                    , Recently, Kumar et al. [28] found that most commonly used tools for non-synonymous SNV classification yield high false positive rates for ultra conserved sites. To examine the dependence of the accuracy of our method upon conservations of indel sites, we calculated conservation scores according to relative entropy (RE) [29]
                     where 
                     is the probability of amino acid types at a sequence position obtained from PSI-BLAST [30], and 
                     is the background probability from the blosum62 matrix [31]. We divided our dataset into three portions (high, median, low) according to the average relative entropy of deleted residues or two residues around the insertion position (RE≥150, 70≤RE<150, RE<70). As in Kumar et al. [28], we also observed an elevated false positive rate at highly conserved sites (33%), relative to poorly conserved sites (14%). Interestingly, the true positive rate at highly conserved sites is also higher (95% at high RE sites versus 72% at low RE sites). Thus, the overall performance of our method is not strongly dependent upon conservation of indel sites. The MCC values are 0.67, 0.63 and 0.58 for high, median and low RE indels, respectively. The relative independence of our method on the conservation of indel sites reflects the fact that sequence conservation is not the dominant feature in our indel discrimination technique. It should be noted that the threshold for indel discrimination can be modified for high RE sites to reduce the somewhat elevated false positive rate., It is worthy of note that the indel length is one of the top features selected by SVM. This is reasonable because longer indels will likely have greater impact upon protein structure and function. However, it could also be due to bias in our datasets because, empirically, the majority of indels involve short lengths of one or two residues in both our datasets, a reflection of the inherent bias of the underlying mutational mechanism in vivo. Such an unbalanced dataset renders size-controlled or stratified sampling impossible. Thus, to determine whether the length dependence is a result of dataset bias or is instead of true functional origin would require further studies employing much larger datasets for both disease-causing and neutral indels. Nevertheless, the effect of this feature on the overall accuracy is small. Removing this feature only decreases the MCC value from 0.684 to 0.664 for our non-redundant indel sets., In addition to the features listed in Table 1 we also performed a test for the usefulness of biochemical properties of amino acid residues such as residue size and hydrophobicity scale for indel discrimination. This is in part because such features have been found to be effective in protein secondary structure prediction [32, 33]. We examined seven representative physical parameters including a steric parameter (graph shape index), hydrophobicity, volume, polarizability, isoelectric point, helix probability, and sheet probability [32, 33]. None of these features were found to further improve the MCC value for indel discrimination., This work is consistent with various studies that have examined the sequence context of microdeletions and microinsertions. These studies found that indels occurred non-randomly and were highly influenced by the local DNA sequence context [2, 34, 35]. This probably accounts for the success of our algorithm in NFS-indel classification based upon local sequence and structural information. Furthermore, microinsertions and microdeletions exhibit strong similarities in terms of the characteristics of their flanking DNA sequences, implying that they are generated by very similar underlying mechanisms [2]. Again, this accords with our ability to design a single tool capable of discriminating between microdeletions and microinsertions of pathological importance and neutral microdeletions/microinsertions., This study focused on NFS-indels only because FS-indels would require a quite separate algorithm to effect their classification. Such an algorithm would require features based on the entire region after the indel site, rather than simply the local region around the indel site. This is because the frame-shift in FS-indels results either in a completely different amino-acid sequence C-terminal to the indel site or premature termination of translation. Expansion of DDIG-in so as to include FS-indels is however in progress. In the meantime, our sequence- and structure-based tool will complement two recently developed methods [16, 17] that are based on information derived only from nucleotide and amino-acid sequences. In addition to extension to cover FS-indels, we intend to incorporate new features other than sequence- and structure-based features. Other such features (for example, predicted functional regions) may well be useful in further improving the micro-indel classification as was previously achieved for SNP classification [11–14]."

Most prior work on gene retrocopy discovery compared copies in reference genome assemblies to their source genes. Here, we explore gene retrocopy insertion polymorphisms (GRIPs) that are present in the germlines of individual humans, mice, and chimpanzees, and we identify novel gene retrocopy insertions in cancerous somatic tissues that are absent from patient-matched non-cancer genomes., Through analysis of whole-genome sequence data, we found evidence for 48 GRIPs in the genomes of one or more humans sequenced as part of the 1,000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, but which were not in the human reference assembly. Similarly, we found evidence for 755 GRIPs at distinct locations in one or more of 17 inbred mouse strains but which were not in the mouse reference assembly, and 19 GRIPs across a cohort of 10 chimpanzee genomes, which were not in the chimpanzee reference genome assembly. Many of these insertions are new members of existing gene families whose source genes are highly and widely expressed, and the majority have detectable hallmarks of processed gene retrocopy formation. We estimate the rate of novel gene retrocopy insertions in humans and chimps at roughly one new gene retrocopy insertion for every 6,000 individuals., We find that gene retrocopy polymorphisms are a widespread phenomenon, present a multi-species analysis of these events, and provide a method for their ascertainment.","","Mammalian genomes contain thousands of pseudogenes - stretches of DNA sequence with homology to functional genes. As an example, pseudogene.org documents 17,061 human pseudogenes in build 65, and 19,119 mouse pseudogenes in build 60 [1–3]. A recent, more stringent survey identified 14,112 pseudogenes in the human genome [4]. Pseudogenes originate through a variety of mechanisms including retrotransposition of processed mRNAs (processed pseudogenes), segmental duplication, and inactivating mutations. Processed pseudogenes are derived from spliced transcripts and they lack the intron-exon structure of their source gene [5]., Retrotransposition refers to the insertion of DNA sequences mediated by an RNA intermediate [6]. In humans, this process is carried out chiefly through the reverse-transcriptase [7] and endonuclease [8] functions of the LINE-1 ORF2 protein, with assistance from the ORF1 protein, which binds RNA [9] and functions as a chaperone [10]. In addition to mobilizing its own transcripts, LINE-1 mobilizes other transcripts including, but probably not limited to, Alu [11], SINE-VNTR-Alu [12] and processed pseudogenes [13]. The specific reverse-transcriptase responsible for processed pseudogene formation varies among species depending on the retroelement content in the genome. For example, in S. cerevisiae, processed pseudogenes are mobilized by Ty1 elements [14]. In this study we refer to retroposed gene transcripts as gene retrocopies to avoid confusion with the functional connotations of terms such as 'pseudogene' and 'retrogene' [15]. When used, 'pseudogene' (or retropseudogene) refers to a non-functional gene retrocopy while 'retrogene' refers to a gene retrocopy with intact activity., A growing number of contemporary studies highlight the extent to which individuals differ in terms of inserted retrotransposon sequences [16], but there has not been significant study of how mammalian genomes differ from one another and from the reference assembly in a given population due to gene retrocopy insertions, although detection of the phenomenon has been discussed briefly [17, 18]. Retrogene insertion polymorphisms have been described in a study of 37 Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines [19] based on the detection of intron presence/absence polymorphisms., Pseudogenes affect genome function in several important ways. Although most gene retrocopies lack the 5' promoter and regulatory regions present at the site of origin [5], mobilization to another genomic location can put the retrocopy in a novel regulatory context that may allow it to be transcribed [20–22]. Transcription of certain gene retrocopies can be either widespread, specific to a tissue or cell type, or specific to particular tumors [23]. Transcribed gene retrocopies can regulate the source transcript through an antisense mechanism [24], are a source of siRNAs [25–28], can affect the stability of the source transcript [29], and can affect expression of the source gene by providing a molecular sponge that competes with the source transcript for miRNA binding due to sequence similarity to the source gene [30]. Retrocopies and retrogenes can exert direct effects if the nearby genomic architecture promotes their expression, as is the case for a novel insertion of the FGF4 transcript in the domestic dog, which leads to the chondrodysplastic phenotype that typifies many dog breeds [31]. On an evolutionary timescale, the process of gene duplication through retrotransposition of processed transcripts constitutes a major mechanism for new gene formation [32], typified by examples such as the jingwei gene in Drosophila [33]., Here, we refer to a processed gene transcript that is present as a retrotransposed insertion in one or more individuals but absent from the reference genome as a gene retrocopy insertion polymorphism (GRIP). Insertions that are not polymorphic and not transmissible (somatic insertions) are not referred to as GRIPs. We present evidence that the interspersed insertion of processed mRNAs into the genome is an ongoing mechanism of mutation in humans, mice, and chimps, and can occur in tumors. Additionally, the availability of our application for detecting these events will enable all large-scale genome sequencing projects to include gene retrocopy insertions in their analysis of genomic variation., A large fraction of the human genome is covered by copy number variants (CNVs), including regions containing genes [59], and a number of recent publications have highlighted the extent of variability in gene copy number due to CNVs between individual humans. Starting from a large-scale set of deletions detected in human populations [60], Schrider and Hahn calculate that any two humans differ by over 100 gene-containing CNVs [61]. Approximately 9% of human genes appear to vary in copy number, mostly between 0 and 5 copies [62], likely through segmental duplication. The data we have presented here add to what is known about gene copy number variation by highlighting another mechanism separate from the large duplications that cause copy number variability of intron-containing gene loci. Through retrotransposition, GRIPs occur as interspersed insertions of processed transcripts. Whereas segmentally duplicated genes are likely to share the same regulatory regime, gene retrocopy insertions often mobilize copies into novel regulatory contexts, where they tend to experience an increased likelihood of adaptive evolution [63]. Many of these new gene retrocopy insertions will be inactive due to missing promoters, frameshifts, and truncation. That said, the subset of GRIPs that are recent enough not to be lost or fixed through genetic drift are likely to be more recent insertions and likely to have suffered fewer inactivating mutations to the open reading frame and any intact regulatory elements., It is clear that processed gene transcripts are retrotransposed in the germline, and by extension one might imagine that this also occurs in somatic tissues. Transgenic mice with a LINE-1 cassette facilitating detection of insertion events show extensive variation in transposition frequency across tissues [64], and in particular, neural progenitor cells in the brain [65]. There is evidence for somatic retrotransposition during early development in Drosophila [66] and in humans [67]. Somatic retrotransposition of retroelements may also occur in human cancers [44, 45] and contributes to a variety of human diseases [68]. We have demonstrated that insertions of retrotransposed processed transcripts can contribute to somatic variation in tumor tissue. Given this observation, studies of somatic retrotransposition of processed mRNAs in a variety of somatic tissues including the brain may yield novel retrocopy insertions, given evidence for elevated retrotransposition in some specific neural tissues from quantitative PCR [69] and targeted ascertainment of insertion sites [70]. That said, a recent study indicates some neural tissues do not appear to support a high level of retrotransposition [71]., Each new insertion of a gene retrocopy presents a new opportunity for the evolution of a new gene or the modification of an existing function at the site of insertion. There are a number of examples where inserted gene retrocopies have acquired new functions [20]. One notable example is the insertion of cyclophilin A (PPIA) into TRIM5α in the owl monkey leading to a novel gene fusion that confers resistance to HIV-1 infection [72, 73]. A similar mutation involving the insertion of a cyclophilin A retrocopy into TRIM5α also occurred independently in rhesus macaques, leading to resistance to HIV-2 and feline immunodeficiency virus infection [74, 75]. In total, we report 22 human, 201 mouse, and 9 chimp GRIPs in introns or exons that could lead to novel gene fusions with modified functions [21]. While human GRIPs occur in annotated genes about as often as would be expected by chance, we identified a marked depletion of mouse GRIPs in genes. This may indicate purifying selection due to deleterious effects on the genes hosting the GRIPs. In any case, this observation illustrates that the ability to detect this form of genomic variation opens new questions about the biological consequences of gene retrocopy insertion and provides a starting point for further investigation. In general, this study will provide a foundation for future investigation into the functional consequences of gene retrocopy insertion polymorphisms."

We mapped numerous sites at whichDNA methylation was associated with expression of distal genes. These sites bind transcription factors in a methylation-dependent manner, and carry the chromatin marks of a particular class of transcriptional enhancers. In contrast to the traditional model of one enhancer site per cell type, we found that single enhancer sites may define gradients of expression levels across many different cell types. Strikingly, the identified sites were drastically altered in cancers: hypomethylated enhancer sites associated withupregulation of cancer-related genes and hypermethylated sites with downregulation. Moreover, the association between enhancer methylation and gene deregulation in cancerwas significantly stronger than the association of promoter methylationwith gene deregulation., Methylation of distal regulatory sites is closely related to gene expression levels across the genome. Single enhancers may modulate ranges of cell-specific transcription levels, from constantlyopen promoters. In contrast to the remote relationships between promoter methylation and gene dysregulation in cancer, altered methylation of enhancer sites is closely related to gene expression profiles of transformed cells.","Cancer, DNA methylation, distal control elements, enhancers, epigenomics, gene-enhancer pairing, gene regulation, machine-learning","DNA methylation is a key determinant of regulatory chromatin complexes transmitted through cell divisions. Relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression levels were first recognized at gene promoters and CpG islands [1], but were recently observed across the genome [2–6]. In gene promoters, DNA methylation mediates silencing by altering the binding of transcription modulators to their DNA targets [7], but the cause and function of expression-associated methylation away from gene promoters has been elusive. The relationships between aberrant DNA methylation and the altered expression profiles of cancer cells are also not well understood: the predominant pattern in gene promoters is denovo methylation of polycomb-repressed genes [8–11]. Since these genes are already inactive in the normal tissue and generally remain inactive in the cancer [12, 13], it is hard to establish direct contribution to the cancer process [14]. Away from gene promoters, perturbed methylation has been associated with reduced genomic stability [15, 16] and global silencing of large chromatin domains [17, 18], but the effect on transcription of particular genes remains unknown., Transcriptional enhancers support tissue-specific expression profiles through physical interactions with gene promoters. Based on analyses of chromatin structures, hundreds ofthousands of transcriptional enhancers were predicted in mammalian genomes (reviewed in [19]). These sites bind chromatin-modulating factors, interact with distal promoters through DNA loops, and demonstrate a unique pattern of DNA methylation [20]. In some particular examples, enhancer sites turned out to be less methylated in cells expressing the controlled genes than in non-expressing cells [21–24]. Taking a more systematic approach, Wienchet al. recently revealed activity-dependent methylation in a group of distal enhancers in the mouse [25], and Bock et al.[26] demonstrated correlations between enhancer methylation and expression of particular developmental genes during mouse tissue differentiation., We conducted a methodical analysis of distal DNA methylation sites associated with gene expression in normal and cancerous human cells. The results suggest that enhancer methylation corresponds closely with expression profiles of cancer genes in transformed cells., To explore relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression levels across the genome, we took the following strategy. First, we developed a model for the relationships between methylation in gene promoters and gene expression using a machine-learning algorithm. Then, we applied the derived model to methylation sites away from gene promoters and characterized the chromatin structure and binding profile of the discovered sites. Finally, we explored how the identified sites were altered in cancer., We analyzed available DNA methylation and gene expression data for 58 human cell types (Table S1 in Additional file 1). The methylation data were produced by two different assays: reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) andInfinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip(Illuminainc., San Diego, CA, USA). Following verification of high agreement between the assays (Figures S1A and S2A, Bin Additional file 1), we combined the two datasets. We then analyzed variation in methylation levels across the panel of cell types (see Materials and methods for detailed description).Sites with methylation levels that did not change across the cell types were eliminated, and the remaining 670, 906 variable methylation sites (VMSs) were used in the study (Figure S1Bin Additional file 1). VMSs in gene promoterswere negatively correlated with expression whereas VMSs in gene bodies were positively correlated with expression (Figure S2 in Additional file 1), as previously reported [6]. The connection with expression levels was most evident at -500 to +2, 000 base pairs relative to transcription start sites (TSSs) (Figure S2A-Cin Additional file 1). Therefore, we used the CpG methylation sites in this range for model development., The mapping of associationsbetween distal regulatory sites and the genes they control is a challenging task, which only recently began to be confronted on the genome-wide scale. Attempts to predict gene-enhancer pairs were based on the profiling of chromatin states or transcription factor binding [27, 34], or of long-range DNA looping [28, 29].Here, we show that enhancers can be also associated with genes using DNA methylation. In contrast to the above mapping approaches, methylation data are readily available and are highly quantitative, and thus may enhance mapping of gene-enhancer pairing., We found that distal expression-related methylation sites are abundant in the human genome, co-localizing with enhancer chromatin marks, and are more predictive of expression levels then promoter methylations. While not all distal regulatory sites in the genome must exhibited promoter-like methylation, we showed that a large number of enhancer sites demonstrate reverse correlation between methylation and expression, as in gene promoters., We have further shown that hypomethylation state is directly related to enhancer activity across cell types (Figure S3 in Additional file 1). The observation that hypomethylated enhancers bind more transcription factors than methylated ones (Figure 2E) suggests a possible mechanism underlying the connection between DNA methylation and enhancer activity. Consistent with this possibility, high-scoring enhancers are particularly enriched within a defined chromatin state (Figures 2D), which is particularly hypomethylated compared to non-regulatory chromatin (Figure S3Cin Additional file 1). Whether this chromatin state holds particularly active enhancers, or perhaps a unique class of methylation-related enhancers, remains to be elucidated., The range of cell types we analyzed in this study was determined by the availability of methylation and expression data. In addition, the RRBS and Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip methylation data we used provide limited genomic coverage and are strongly biased towards promoters and certain other portions of the genome, while enhancers are not efficiently targeted. Because of this, it is likely that more complete methylomic coverage will expose many additional enhancer-gene pairs. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing approaches have recently become popular and whole methylome analyses of human tissues are rapidly accumulating. Utilizing our approach, these additional data should allow the production of more comprehensive maps of enhancer-gene pairing across tissues, cell types and conditions., Unmethylated promoters are permissive for, but do not necessarily determine, transcription initiation. We showed that enhancer methylation associates with cell-type-specific expression levels, even when the promoter is constantly unmethylated (Figure 3). Moreover, enhancer methylation characterizes small (and larger) expression differences. Thus, enhancers are not just on-off switches of cell-type transcription levels, as previously suggested, but may also mediate ranges of expression levels across multiple cell types. In contrast to the traditional model of one enhancer site per cell type, we suggest that a gradient of methylation states at a single enhancer site may direct distinct expression levels in many different cell types (Figure 3C)., In occasional examples, enhancer methylation level has been suggested to be associated with the control of cancer-related genes[35–37]. However, to our knowledge this is the first report on a global association between perturbed enhancer methylation and aberrant expression of cancer genes. We have shown that hypomethylated enhancers associated with the upregulation of many cancer genes controlling various cellular functions (Figure 4C), some of them involved in cell proliferation and some in other cancer-related processes. Moreover, many of these hypomethylated genes were found in most cancer types examined, suggesting a pan-cancer mechanism. However, the larger group of hypermethylated enhancers seemed to target cancer-type-specific genes. Given the limited genomic coverage of this study, many additional cancer-related enhancers are expected in the genome., To date, almost all studies of cancer-related methylation have focused on gene promoters and CpG islands. Among these, the predominant event in cancers is hypermethylation of polycomb-repressed promoters [9–11]. This hypermethylation does not directly affect expression levels, as the associated genes are inactive in the normal tissue and generally remain inactive in the cancer(although it may limit the potential for re-activation of silenced genes in the cancer). Here, we established a very different occurrence in the other large group of regulatory sites - the transcriptional enhancers. These sites are drastically altered in cancers, to both hypo- and hypermethylation, and are closely related to substantial modifications in the expression levels of cancer-related genes (Figure 4). Moreover, their aberrant methylation in cancers might derive from targeted methylation or demethylation or from selection of the altered cells (Figure 5). Whether targeted or selected, aberrant enhancer methylation may be involved in important events during cancer development., We have uncovered a class of distal methylation sites that closely describe cell-type transcription levels. These sites reside in a particular subclass of transcriptional enhancers and are associated with cell-type-specific enhancer activity, possibly through communication with the binding of transcription factors. Methylation levels of these enhancers associate with gradual expression differences across cell types, even when the linked promoters are consistently unmethylated across the cell types. The radical changes in methylation of these sites in cancer is beyond that expected from the general profile of the cancer methylome, and may reflect specific targeting of the methylation and demethylation machinery to these sites, and/or functional contribution to tumor development. Further analyses of these sites may provide crucial information about paradigms of gene expression control in normal and cancerous cells."

Here, we examine our understanding of the bacteria that co-inhabit our artificial world and how they might influence human health., The global trend towards industrialization and urbanization has led to ever more people living and working indoors. Some studies estimate that humans in industrialized countries spend as much as 90% of their lives inside [1, 2]. They are born in hospitals, raised in homes or apartments, work in office buildings or factories and move to nursing homes in their old age. This trend towards indoor living is also occurring in developing nations. Thirty years ago, the Chinese city of Shenzhen was a small city of 300,000 inhabitants. Since then, it has grown into a massive industrial megalopolis housing over 10 million people, many of whom have moved there from rural areas [3]. Thus, for billions of humans, the built environment (BE) now represents the modern ecological habitat of Homo sapiens sapiens., In the process of creating BEs, we have also inadvertently created an incredible diversity of microhabitats that have been colonized by thousands of different microorganisms. Indeed, BEs contain many potential novel habitats for microbial life that have chemical and physical properties not found in the natural world. Humans convey a large fraction of the colonizing microbes into these habitats by shedding them from their bodies or transporting them by means of their clothes and shoes, whereas the rest originate from water or other environmental sources (for example, soil) [4–7]. Depending on the environment, microbes can also be transported indoors by pets, insects and other animals [8]., While culture-based studies have found microbes to be ubiquitous in the BE, recent culture-independent molecular studies have shown that our understanding of indoor microbial diversity remains extremely sparse [9–13]. These molecular methods are also an integral part of the tool kit for expanding our understanding of what species of microorganisms live in these ecosystems, how they function and how they migrate among humans, physical surfaces and other environments [6, 14, 15]., The most commonly used molecular approach for exploring microbial diversity is based on the PCR amplification and sequencing of genes encoding small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) directly from environmental sources [16]. In this approach, DNA is directly extracted from all the microbial cells present in a sample and 'universal' PCR primers designed from conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene are used to amplify this gene from all the microbial genomes in the sample [16, 17]. This approach readily determines several orders of magnitude more microbial diversity than culture-based methods, often discovering novel organisms with no known growth conditions, and has dramatically altered our understanding of global microbial diversity [14]. Although powerful, there are two obvious sources of bias in this method. First, different DNA extraction techniques allow access to different parts of the microbial diversity to varying extents, through uneven cell lysis [18, 19]. Second, there are no truly universal PCR primers, with even the most comprehensive pair covering approximately 85% of the known taxa [20]. Despite these limitations, this technology, when combined with a rigorous experimental design, is extremely useful for characterizing the dynamics and ecological patterns of microbial ecosystems [21, 22]. The initial 16S rRNA diversity studies performed in the BE cloned PCR amplicons into plasmid vectors before transformation, colony isolation and sequencing [9, 10, 12]. However, the application of direct emulsion-PCR-based sequencing in 2006 [23] dramatically increased the depth and breadth of analysis; similar technologies now enable the simultaneous processing of thousands of samples at a depth of hundreds of thousands of sequence reads each [24, 25]., Here, we review the literature on culture-independent analysis of microbial diversity in the BE and explore what it tells us about the dynamics and distribution of bacteria and fungi in these environments. So, why is the BE even worth exploring? First, as already stated, the BE is the primary habitat for a large and growing percentage of humanity, whose health might depend upon our firm comprehension of the interaction between humans and the microbiology of buildings. Second, the climate, materials and design of artificial environments could have unexpected and interesting consequences for the selection and growth of microbes that might help us to design healthier buildings. Finally, a deeper understanding of indoor microbial diversity should help inform public health policy, particularly in settings with many immune-compromised individuals (for example, hospitals, intensive care units and nursing homes). The renewed interest in microbial ecology, and the application of next-generation sequencing technology, presents exciting opportunities to uncover hidden diversity and interactions in these environments. As we will show, these methods have already revealed the BE to be a surprisingly complex and highly dynamic microbial ecosystem that collects and selects for a remarkable array of novel diversity., It goes without saying that the BE contains chemical compounds and physical conditions entirely unlike the natural world where microbes evolved. Drywall, floor wax, polyester, carpeting, constant temperature and humidity, novel hydrocarbons and polymers - these are just some of the many features found in BEs that potentially provide unusual growth conditions and niches for bacteria and fungi. While natural microbial evolution might not have originally selected for phenotypes able to exploit these conditions or materials, the incredible diversity and adaptability of the microbial world means that there probably exists a microbe that will survive on almost any BE surface or condition. Moreover, the short generation times and rapid evolutionary mechanisms (for example, horizontal gene transfer) found in the microbial world mean that many microbes might have already adapted to the BE over the past few hundred years., Culture-based studies have repeatedly discovered conditions in the BE that enrich for particular bacteria and fungi [26–28]. However, while culture isolation focuses on the presence of particular bacteria or fungi, molecular studies of BEs typically uncover polymicrobial communities comprising hundreds or thousands of uncultured microbes. When conditions in the BE enrich strongly for particular traits, these polymicrobial communities tend to be dominated by a few microbial groups (Table 1). For instance, an analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA sequence diversity in hospital therapy pools and showerheads found they enriched for diverse, primarily uncultured, soil-dwelling Mycobacteria, as well as many Proteobacteria and other, rarer groups [9, 29]. Shower curtains tend to be dominated by dozens of different Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium species, many of them uncultured [10]. The latter are particularly interesting as some Methylobacterium species have been shown to grow on an enormous diversity of different carbon compounds (that is, C2, C3 and C4 compounds) [30], and some species thrive on the decay products of human skin cells [31]. Studies of showerheads and hospital shower stalls find them, like therapy pools, to be hospitable environments for Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria [29, 32]. Other highly selective environments include the tubing of catheters [33, 34], which maintain a significantly different microbial community internally compared with externally, and NASA clean-rooms used for spacecraft assembly [35, 36]. In the latter case, the extensive sealing and sterilization protocols appeared to select for only the hardiest of microbes that also survive space journeys [35].Table 1

Studies of keyboards [37], restrooms [4] and offices [5] show that humans are the main source of the microbial diversity in many indoor environments and are also its principle vector. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a great number of surface microbes can be traced back to human skin, although gut and nasal/oral environments also contribute [5, 6]. Molecular studies of bacterial diversity in offices [5, 12], hospitals [11], airplanes [7, 38], kitchens [39] and restrooms [4] have consistently found a predominance of human skin-associated, and gastrointestinal or urogenital-associated, bacteria on most physical surfaces. In fact, Tringe and colleagues showed that the bacteria living on the skin of individuals inhabiting a particular space define the microbial community observed in air samples taken from that same space [13]. Given that the average human sheds approximately 1.5 million skin cells an hour, carrying with them approximately 15 million bacterial cells [40], humans clearly contribute substantially, and perhaps predominantly, to indoor microbial diversity., Direct transfer of skin microbiota through surface contact has also been shown to have a considerable and area-specific impact. Depending on the surface, skin contact can transfer millions of microbial cells in each event [41], leading to the rapid and continual inoculation and re-inoculation of surfaces touched repeatedly, such as light switches, door handles, keyboards, soap dispensers and toilet seats [4, 5, 37]. Furthermore, a number of studies have demonstrated that the dominant microbiota associated with human skin differs dramatically among individuals [42–46]. Indeed, it might be possible to identify people based on the unique microbial signature they leave behind in a room or on a surface, which has significant potential applications in forensics. Figure 1 diagrams various sources and transmission routes of hypothetical BE microbial communities and indicates how they might contribute to the microbial ecology of indoor surfaces.

                        Illustration showing the various sources and transmission routes of hypothetical built environment microbial communities. Also indicated is how these communities might contribute to the microbial ecology of indoor surfaces, as well as various abiotic factors (for example, temperature) that may influence microbial diversity.
                    , Despite the evidence suggesting that humans interact microbially with their indoor spaces, the mechanistic relationship enabling this interaction remains poorly characterized. As the BE can also be a source of microbes that colonize people, it is essential that we investigate 'who lives where' in the BE. Thus far, the literature has primarily explored the phenomenon of fungal contamination on damp surfaces [40, 47–49]; the role of hygiene in removing microbial communities [46, 50]; and the length of time microbes can survive on surfaces [51]. The microbial diversity of dust has also been explored [12, 52, 53], as has the diversity of indoor air [11, 13, 54]. One study investigated the temporal succession of microbial communities performed on indoor dust and found building-specific seasonal patterns that were a combination of skin cells shed from inhabitants within the buildings and seasonally defined microbiota from the external environment [12]., In addition to human skin, other aspects of the human microbiome can also contribute significantly to the BE microbiome, although the contribution tends to be more situation specific. As might be expected, human gut and vaginal flora play a major role in shaping the microbial communities associated with surfaces in restrooms [4], daycare centers [55] and neonatal intensive care units [56]. Although few molecular studies have directly investigated the impact of pets, it is expected that animal skin, hair, fecal material (for example, cat litter), saliva and possibly fleas all contribute significantly to microbial communities associated with indoor surfaces and air [1, 8]. The impact of fish tanks on the BE microbiome might also be worth considering as these environments have a unique microbial consortia [57, 58]. Understanding the contribution of animal inhabitants might be particularly helpful in understanding the causes of childhood asthma [59]., Most indoor settings also obtain a considerable fraction of their microbiota from environmental sources. Dust samples in offices consistently uncovered bacteria associated with soil and the plant rhizosphere [5]. The amount and type appears to depend on the degree of outdoor ventilation and the local climate. Kembel and colleagues found significant differences in the contribution of natural environmental bacteria in buildings that were well ventilated versus those with sealed windows [11]. Rintala and co-workers showed dramatic changes in dust microflora according to different seasons [12], while Hewitt and colleagues found a strong climatic signal in the office dust of buildings in Tucson, Arizona (desert soil bacteria), compared with dust in New York and San Francisco [5]. The restroom study of Flores et al. also found soil bacteria over the restroom floor that was probably transferred from shoes [4]., Clearly, BE microbial communities comprise microbes from a diverse array of human and environmental habitats. The ability to compare vast metagenomic datasets of either ribosomal sequences or whole microbial genome fragments from BE sinks with environmental, animal and human source communities, and the application of bioinformatic tools that estimate the relative contribution of various sources to communities (for example, SourceTracker [6]), will be instrumental in understanding microbial colonization and transmission in the BE., The molecular studies cited in this review have just begun to inform and advance the understanding of microbial diversity in the BE. As the methods improve in terms of cost, speed and depth, the experimental design possibilities grow proportionally. Analyzing thousands of samples simultaneously provides a much broader assessment of the role humans and environmental sources play in the development and persistence of the indoor microbiome. These 'faster, better, cheaper' methods will also allow more sophisticated statistical design and lengthy time-series analyses., Proper study designs and increased sequencing power will make it possible to understand how BEs are colonized, how microbes spread through these environments, and the rate at which microbial communities change in the BE. For example, a recent study funded by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation plans to investigate all these factors in a newly built hospital as it becomes occupied with staff and patients [60]. The relatively low cost of sample processing and sequencing means that this study is examining >15,000 surfaces (both human and built), with daily (35 samples a day) collection for an entire year, providing unparalleled resolution for investigating colonization and transmission of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the hospital infrastructure. This study aims to identify the microbial streets and highways that enable rapid transmission of bacteria through this ecosystem, and it is expected that pathogens will also use these routes. Because the human microbiome contributes the majority of the BE microbes, and humans also probably vector a significant proportion of soil and other environmental microbes through shoes, hands and clothes (for example, see [60]), future studies need to follow and sample the human inhabitants as they enter and move through the BE over time, but to do this it will be necessary to define the rate of change in the microbiome to sample at the appropriate temporal and spatial resolution., A number of other key questions concerning the BE will need to be addressed, such as the role of surface materials, ventilation, local climatic conditions and the physical conditions of the building in shaping the microbial diversity. Answers to these questions will require thorough and systematic sampling, rigorous statistical design and collaboration with experts in building science and engineering. The issue of ventilation and airflow appears to deserve special attention as these affect the rate and direction of bioaerosol transmission to sensitive respiratory mucosal surfaces. Studies by Kembel et al. [11] and Poza et al. [61] provide tantalizing evidence that the amount of external air makes a significant difference in the microbial diversity in a hospital setting, perhaps even affecting overall pathogen loads, and the usage of different environments (for example, operating room versus waiting room) also impacts the microbial profiles of these spaces. Collaborations between microbiologists and building scientists will be especially important for understanding the impact of materials and machine-aided ventilation, especially given their variability and complexity between different BEs., Thus far, the molecular studies of the BE have primarily investigated bacterial diversity through the sequencing of community 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The advantages of using this gene for surveying microbial diversity are well known [62]. However, the limits of amplicon sequencing for both diversity and functional studies are also familiar, including PCR bias [63], variable copy numbers per genome [64], limited taxonomic resolution [65] and indirect functional knowledge (that is, inference of community function through phylogenetic relationships). Higher throughput and sensitivity (for example, lower DNA concentrations required to generate sequence data), lower sequencing costs and advances in computation should enable the future application of shotgun metagenomics (that is, sequencing of all genomic DNA in a given sample) and whole-genome sequencing in the indoor environment [66, 67]. This will allow the simultaneous analysis of microbial diversity, including deeper taxonomic resolution (strains and subspecies) and more direct functional analysis at the genomic level. For example, the Hospital Microbiome Project is implementing Illumina Nextera library generation to sequencing thousands of microbial and viral metagenomes. Deeper taxonomic resolution and determination of gene function will be important for verifying pathogens in indoor settings by allowing the differentiation between commensals and pathogens (for example, Escherichia coli K12 versus E. coli OH157:H7) and for detecting pathogenic islands or antibiotic resistance markers on chromosomal and extra-chromosomal elements. Table 2 compares and contrasts shotgun metagenomics and other methods (amplicon sequencing, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metabolomics) used in microbial community research that could potentially be applied to the BE.Table 2
                      Comparison of different techniques, including pros and cons, for analysis of microbial communities
                    TechniqueDescriptionAdvantagesDisadvantagesAmplicon sequencingThe amplification and sequencing of a single gene from a broad selection of the microbiome. Traditionally applied to 16S rRNA for bacteria, but now being applied to a wide range of targetsPrimarily cost and depth of analysis. Amplicon sequencing is very cheap and enables a rapid and deep characterization of the varying structure of microbial life under changing environmental gradientsThis approach provides a narrow field of view, targeting a single gene, be it taxonomic or functionally informative, and only gives information about that one gene. It also can be affected by primer and amplification biasesGenomic sequencingSequencing of the genome of representatives of a community, ideally resulting in a single sequence, but more often resulting in 100s of genomic fragmentsThe genome enables a defined link between potential function and phylogeny, so that one can deduce that species x performs process y. When linked to a cultured cell, it can also be used to define gene function through targeted biochemical testsThroughput is a problem. Sequencing the genome of isolated organisms has become rudimentary, but few can be isolated. Screening sorted cells from a community, followed by sequencing, is becoming viable, but often results in limited coverage of the genome owing to amplification biasMetagenomic sequencingSequencing of a random sample of the genomic DNA from the cells of a microbial consortiumThis technique enables broad observation of the taxonomic and functional genes from an entire community, without the bias associated with amplicon sequencing. With sufficiently deep sequencing, it is also possible to reassemble microbial genomes and other genetic elementsCurrent sequencing platforms require extensive starting material, although this is changing. Cost can be prohibitive, leading to only shallow characterization of the most dominant microbial taxa. The output only describes potential function, and it is often difficult to link function and phylogeny definitively. Also has the potential to sequence DNA from dead cellsMetatranscriptomic sequencingRandom sequencing of the messenger, small and other RNAs from a microbial community that define the mechanism and response of microbial gene expressionAs with metagenomics, this technique enables broad taxonomic and functional characterization, but of expressed genes, which enables deeper analysis of the community and targets the active members of the community. Sequence data can be mapped to known genomes to help identify phylogenetic-specific functional responsesCost is prohibitive as the steps required to remove the 90-95% of ribosomal RNA to enable deeper characterization of the mRNA are expensive and time consuming, which also limits throughput. RNA is sensitive to degradation, and the half-life of mRNA is very short, which creates biases from sampling the community.Metaproteomic sequencingRandom sequencing of the amino acid sequences that represent the protein material in a microbial communityThe primary advantage is the ability to identify proteins that have not only been expressed as mRNA but have also been folded and have potentially formed active proteins - for example, enzymes - in a cell. When combined with genomics and metatranscriptomics, it is possible to define protein isoforms and map protein function to phylogenyThe primary disadvantage of cost and throughput, which is still higher than metagenomics or metatranscriptomics. By itself, it is complicated to assign taxonomyMetabolomic sequencingRandom characterization of the metabolic products present in a sample that might have been generated by a microbial communityThis is the zenith of microbial activity, and when compared with that of other samples, the relative change in metabolite concentration can explain a lot about the functional consequence of genomic potential, or transcript and protein abundanceAs with proteomics, metabolomics is limited by cost and throughput but also by identification of products. It also currently has a limit of detection, with very rare metabolites being hard to detect, Methods such as shotgun metagenomics will also be necessary to analyze the diversity of viruses (bacteriophage and eukaryotic viral diversity, also known as the 'virome' [68]) in the BE, which is very poorly understood. Bacteriophage, in particular, play a major role in the dynamics of natural microbial populations (predator-prey relationships) [69] and also facilitate the horizontal transfer of crucial genes (for example, toxin and metabolic genes) among bacteria [70]. Models of BE microbial ecology will certainly be incomplete without a parallel understanding of viral community diversity, and understanding the contribution of bacteriophage to bacterial pathogenicity in places such as hospitals could be an extremely important contribution to public health. Recent studies have used deep-sequencing approaches to characterize viral diversity and gene content for bacteriophage [71, 72] and eukaryotic viruses [73] in the human microbiome, and similar approaches could be applied in the BE. In fact, we ourselves have been funded by the Sloan Foundation to study viral metagenomics in the BE. Although we have found evidence of viral-like particles (VLPs) in all of our samples, the low biomass on indoor surface biofilms presents a significant challenge to this work, particularly with short-lived and low-abundance eukaryotic viruses., Molecular studies of fungal community diversity, clearly of great interest in the BE, have also been limited by choice of marker gene and taxonomic breadth of primer amplification [53, 74, 75]. However, the recent development of novel primers targeting the intergenic spacer region between small- and large-subunit ribosomal RNA genes is being applied to amplify a broader diversity of fungal sequences that could help expand our understanding of BE fungal diversity [75]. Dollive and colleagues have also developed a sorely needed software pipeline for the analysis of eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene sequences [76]. The combination of primers that capture a greater taxonomic diversity and better software tools for analysis should allow greater insight not only into BE fungal diversity but also for a deeper understanding of the interactions between BE fungal and bacterial communities., One criticism of environmental molecular studies, which is of particular relevance for the BE, is the issue of whether a microbial DNA signature comes from a viable organism. Identification of a microbe through DNA sequencing only verifies that the particular organism was present at some time, but it might no longer be viable, especially considering the extreme conditions present on most surfaces (for example, extremely low humidity, limited nutrients, UV exposure). Understanding which of the microbes in a community persist in a viable state will be especially important for verifying their pathogenic potential. While culturing remains the standard for establishing viability, it is limited in that most organisms are recalcitrant to culture. Therefore, it is essential that we develop methods for both the in situ radiolabeling of active organisms and the direct sequencing of rRNA and mRNA from microbial communities. One of the common problems in bacteria transcriptomics is the removal of ribosomal RNA, which comprises 90 to 95% of the total RNA. In eukaryotic cells, the mRNA has a poly-A tail, which can be used to selectively isolate these sequences. Therefore, since 2008, many methods have been developed to remove rRNA and improve the enrichment of bacterial mRNA in community samples (for example, [77, 78]). Indeed, the development of rapid rRNA removal and mRNA enrichment tools has led to these methods being applied even in low-biomass environments, such as subsections of human intestinal epithelium tissue, which now put these techniques in reach of researchers working with BE samples [79]. RNA is rapidly degraded in the environment, and its presence suggests the existence of active cells [77]. However, the low biomass on most surfaces will require innovative strategies to reach the nucleic acid quantities required for most sequencing platforms (that is, 0.5 to 1 µg). The development of novel extraction techniques (for example, MoBio power kits) and sequencing library preparations (for example, Nextera-Illumina, which requires 1 to 50 ng of starting material) means that a solution is potentially imminent., Studies of the unseen majority inside the BE were initiated to determine how bacteria and fungi might affect human health long after it was realized that spending time indoors, away from fresh air, might increase rates of acute and chronic illness. In recent years, it has become apparent that studying the BE might also allow us to better interrogate the ecological interactions between microorganisms. This means that our artificial environments, in and of themselves, have become a new ecosystem worthy of significant investigation. Research focused on the BE has also allowed us to elucidate how microbes interact in this space, and it is, in turn, enabling us with the help of new technologies to understand better how humans interact with the microbiology of indoor spaces. Recent discoveries in the microbiome of the BE, facilitated by enlightened investment, show us that we share our living spaces with an immense diversity of microbial life, some potentially bad, others good, and most just along for the ride. As the resource and personnel costs of performing high-throughput microbiological studies decrease, it will be possible to perform ever-more-detailed characterization of the rate of transmission of microbes between the BE and ourselves and of the metabolic consequences of sharing our living and working spaces with the invisible biosphere. Without a doubt, this new field of research will lead to discoveries that will change the way that we build, clean and live in our new ecosystem."
"173","Food for thought from plant and animal genomes","Emily Abrash","Stanford University Department of Biology","Emily Abrash","eabrash@stanford.edu","27 February 2013","A report on the Plant and Animal Genome XXI meeting, held in San Diego, USA, January 12-16, 2013., On 12 January, on a morning full of blue sky and cold sunshine, the Plant and Animal Genome XXI meeting opened its doors for the 21st time at the Town and Country Hotel in San Diego. I arrived a couple of hours late, a newbie toting a roller suitcase, a little unprepared for the sheer scope of the meeting I was about to attend. The diversity of topics and attendees at the meeting, 'The Largest Ag-Genomics Meeting in the World', was stunning. Within my first hour, I would wind up eating my boxed lunch with a member of the transitional government of Egypt, who moonlights as a grad student in Colorado; and within my first afternoon, I would hear talks about drought resistance in rice, marker-assisted breeding in sweet cherry and transgressive segregation in cotton, not to mention the 12 concurrent sessions on topics from citrus genomes to swine breeding. As a plant developmental biologist interested in international agriculture, I chose talks with an eye towards the border between basic and applied research, the brackish zone where molecular biological innovations find their way into research centers, field trials, and ultimately, farmers' fields. In this report, I will present examples of the diverse and exciting work being done at this intersection, and will conclude by highlighting some emerging trends and challenges on the horizon.","","Some work presented at the meeting was not directly translational, but rather examined basic biological questions using a system or angle relevant to agriculture. Steve Jacobsen's (University of California, Los Angeles and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, USA) plenary talk provided an excellent example of such work. Jacobsen, who has done extensive research on the epigenetics of Arabidopsis thaliana, gave a talk in an earlier session on the genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of a panel of 86 Arabidopsis silencing mutants. As part of his plenary presentation, however, he examined how similar techniques can be used to analyze the epigenetic changes that occur during rice callus transformation. By profiling DNA methylation patterns of individual callus-derived lines, Jacobsen's group showed that regenerants lose methylation relative to parental plants, and that loss typically occurs in certain regions of the genome (although the exact pattern differs among regenerated plants). As production of transgenic cereals generally requires a callus stage, this work will be valuable in understanding variability in crop transformation outcomes., Another example of elegant basic research with agricultural significance was Sue Wessler's (University of California, Riverside, USA) work on transposable elements in rice. Her work focuses on mPing, an element currently undergoing a burst of amplification in several rice strains. By monitoring movement of mPing in individual plants over multiple generations, Wessler's group has been able to demonstrate that a non-coding insertional preference, together with the ability to confer adaptive changes in gene expression (for example, stress inducibility), may explain why mPing amplification is tolerated. Understanding how transposable elements such as mPing interact with and influence their hosts provides insight into an important force shaping evolution of crop genomes., Other work presented at the meeting used sophisticated molecular-genetic approaches to directly address practical agricultural questions. One beautiful example came from Rico Gamuyao's (International Rice Research Institute, Philippines) analysis of the Pup1 quantitative trait locus (QTL) for elevated phosphorus uptake, which was originally derived from the Indian rice cultivar Kasalath, which is adapted to nutrient-poor soil. Pup1 was mapped to a small chromosomal insertion absent from the Nipponbare reference genome. A protein kinase gene within the insertion was named phosphorus-starvation tolerance 1 (Pstol1), and its function was confirmed by overexpression of the gene, which conferred increased yields and greater phosphorus accumulation under phosphorus-deficient conditions. The basis of this tolerance appears to be developmental: Pstol1 overexpressors have enhanced root growth, while Pstol1 RNA interference plants have reduced root growth and fewer crown roots. The Pup1 locus has been incorporated into breeding programs and field trials, such that this elegant study also provides a practical resource for crop improvement., Another example of molecular-genetic research with direct benefits for crop breeding comes from Yusaku Uga's (National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Japan) work on drought resistance in rice. Uga and colleagues identified, mapped and cloned an upland rice-derived QTL called deeper rooting 1 (Dro1), which increases depth of rooting and thus improves drought tolerance. Dro1 encodes an auxin-regulated protein of unknown function expressed in dividing cells of the root tip and appears to promote deeper rooting by enhancing asymmetric growth in response to gravity. Uga has also identified QTLs controlling root thickness, length and volume, and these are currently being mapped and cloned, as well as pyramided with Dro1 to enhance drought tolerance., While many attendees were working directly on crops, the meeting was also a gathering place for those studying emerging models related to agriculturally important species. Brachypodium distachyon, a C3 grass related to barley and wheat, is an emerging model for temperate grasses, while Setaria viridis, a C4 grass related to maize, switchgrass and foxtail millet, is a closer model for tropical grasses. This year, presentations incorporating B. distachyon examined traits as diverse as cell wall composition (Sam Hazen, University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA), iron homeostasis (Elsbeth Walker, University of Massachusetts Amherst, USA) and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (Liudmila Yafremava, University of Illinois, USA). For the newer model S. viridis, Tom Brutnell (The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, USA) described exciting progress in development of resources, including Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with 7 to 10% efficiency and generation of a mutant population to screen for C4 photosynthetic defects. As these models mature, they will have the potential to accelerate functional studies in grasses and yield findings that can readily be translated to crop and biofuel species., Alongside conventional mapping and molecular-genetic approaches, a major theme at this year's Plant and Animal Genome meeting was the potential of genomic selection and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to facilitate gene discovery and accelerate the breeding cycle in crops. While broadly used in human genetics, these approaches are still being explored and developed for crop species and livestock; as discussed by Rex Bernardo (University of Minnesota, USA) and David Habier (Iowa State University, USA), a diverse array of factors, including properties of populations under study, the heritability of the trait of interest, and the type of genetic interactions involved, affect both the predictive capabilities of genomic selection and GWAS and the type of strategy best applied., Nonetheless, reports on the incorporation of large-scale genomic strategies into public breeding efforts illustrate their clear and growing utility. For example, Susanne Dreisigacker (CIMMYT, Mexico) described the progression of her institute's wheat breeding program from a phenotyping-based approach to marker-assisted selection and, ultimately, to genomic selection using high-throughput sequencing. Similarly encouraging results in sorghum were presented by Geoffrey Morris (University of South Carolina, USA), who conducted GWAS for height and inflorescence architecture as part of a collaboration with ICRISAT centers. This work included 971 diverse sorghum accessions, demonstrating the power of GWAS to identify functionally relevant variation within large germplasm collections. Comparable strategies are also being used to exploit maize genetic diversity, as highlighted in Edward Buckler's (USDA-ARS, USA) work combining maize HapMap data, QTL analysis of nested association mapping lines, and genotyping-by-sequencing (reduced representation genotyping) to perform GWAS for developmental and metabolic traits. Next-generation sequencing has made genotyping more cost-effective than phenotyping in many cases, such that genomic selection and GWAS may allow both faster and more economical crop improvement., To attend the Plant and Animal Genome meeting is to come away inspired, but also wanting more: the next paradigm-shifting discovery, the next page-turn of the story. What, then, are some emerging trends and challenges? Certainly, integration of genomic selection and GWAS approaches into breeding programs will be a major project of the coming years. Another emerging paradigm of interest is automated large-scale phenotyping (as in the Adelaide 'Plant Accelerator' facility described by Mark Tester, The University of Adelaide, Australia). Yet I would suggest one of the most exciting challenges is that presented by Jeffrey Bennetzen (University of Georgia, USA) in his excellent talk on crop diversification: that of how new technologies and conventional approaches can best be used to improve underutilized staple crops from around the world. As Bennetzen discussed, species important in developing countries, such as sorghum, millet and tef, have potentially valuable properties such as enhanced stress tolerance. Yet these 'orphan crops' are little used in the developed world and, correspondingly, under-improved, such that conventional breeding might yield superior varieties for a relatively small investment. Even simple monogenic mutations could markedly improve such crops: fonio millet displays grain shattering, while tef suffers from lodging (collapsed stems), liabilities that could be eliminated by loss-of-function mutations conferring shatterproof grain and dwarfism, respectively., Bennetzen's group is following up on these particular examples with targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING), and it will be exciting to see which 'silver bullet' mutations are recovered. But there are undoubtedly other crops for which a similarly modest investment in conventional breeding, mutagenesis or genomic selection would yield a dramatic payoff in terms of crop improvement. Such an effort would not only provide superior lines for some of the world's most resource-poor farmers, but might also, as Bennetzen suggests, produce stress-tolerant crops of worldwide benefit in a changing climate."
"174","A CRISPR way to engineer the human genome","Sivaprakash Ramalingam, Narayana Annaluru, Srinivasan Chandrasegaran","Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions","Srinivasan Chandrasegaran","schandra@jhsph.edu","26 February 2013","","","RNA-guided genome engineering based on the type II prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas system provides an efficient and versatile method for targeted manipulation of mammalian genomes., We reported the creation of designer ZFNs [1], and then, in collaboration with Dana Carroll's laboratory in Utah, showed the utility of ZFNs in gene targeting using frog oocytes as a model system [2]. Custom-designed ZFNs - proteins designed to cut at specific DNA sequences - combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of the FokI restriction endonuclease with zinc finger proteins (ZFPs). The Cys2His2 zinc finger (ZF) motif can target specific sequences by virtue of its unique 30 amino acid ββα structure, which is stabilized by a zinc ion. Each ZF motif usually recognizes 3 to 4 bp, and binds DNA by inserting the α-helix into the major groove of the double helix. Amino acids within the α-helix (positions -1, +1, +2, +3, +5, +6) of the ZF motif can be changed, while conserving the remaining amino acids as a consensus backbone, to generate ZF motifs with new sequence specificities. Most ZF motifs make contact with their target 3-bp site; however, when there is an aspartic acid residue present at the +2 position of the α-helix, the ZF motif makes contact with a base outside the 3-bp site, changing its recognition sequence to a 4-bp site. This ZF motif contact outside the 3-bp site also influences the specificity of neighboring ZF motifs, complicating the generation of ZFPs by simple modular design, where each ZF motif recognizes a triplet sequence. Therefore, design and selection of each ZF motif has to be done in a context-dependent fashion to obtain highly sequence-specific ZFPs, and this is laborious and time consuming. Normally, four such ZF motifs are linked together in tandem to generate a ZFP that binds to a 12-bp site. Binding of two four-finger ZFN monomers each recognizing a 12-bp inverted site is necessary because dimerization of the FokI cleavage domain is required to produce a DSB (Figure 1a). Therefore, four-finger ZFNs effectively have a 24-bp recognition site, which is long enough to specify a unique address within the human genome. Because the recognition specificities of ZFPs can be manipulated experimentally, ZFNs offer a general way to deliver a targeted DSB to the human genome. Owing to the high conservation of DNA repair mechanisms, application of ZFN-mediated gene targeting has been successful in numerous species including Xenopus laevis, Arabidopsis, wheat, rice, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, silkworm, rodents, mice, pigs, cows, butterflies and various human cell types, including immortalized cell lines, primary somatic cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells., The TALENs designed in a modular style similar to ZFNs are also able to target unique loci in complex genomes. While ZFNs use ZF motifs as DNA-binding modules, TALENs utilize the central repeat domain of TAL effectors (TALEs) as for DNA recognition (Figure 1b); both use the FokI catalytic domain as a DNA cleavage module [3]. The TALE central repeat domain consists of repeating units of 33 to 35 amino acids. Each repeat is largely identical, except for two highly variable amino acids at positions 12 and 13, referred to as the repeat variable di-residues (RVDs). Whereas each ZF motif recognizes three to four bases, each TALE motif recognizes a single nucleotide, with the recognition specificity determined by the RVD (for example, NI recognizes A, HD recognizes C, NG or HG recognizes T, and NN recognizes G or A) [4, 5]. Unlike the ZF motifs, the TALE modules each appear to bind DNA without interference from neighboring modules. The DNA recognition code thus provides a one-to-one correspondence between the array of amino acid repeats and the nucleotide sequence of the DNA target. This simple DNA recognition code and its modular nature make TALEs an ideal platform for constructing custom-designed artificial DNA nucleases. Some reports suggest that TALENs have the same efficiency of cutting, but markedly lower cytotoxicity, compared with ZFNs targeted to the same genomic locus., Bacteria and archaea have evolved an adaptive defense mechanism that uses a CRISPR/Cas system to degrade complementary sequences present within invading viral and plasmid sequences. The type II CRISPR/Cas system relies on integration of foreign DNA fragments into clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci. Upon transcription and processing, these inserts produce short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs), which then anneal to a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA), enabling CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to direct sequence-specific degradation of the foreign DNA. It turns out that Cas9 endonuclease-mediated cleavage can also function efficiently using a fusion of crRNA and tracrRNA to form a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). Several groups have now shown that they can engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system to function with custom gRNA in human cells in vitro to direct sequence-specific cleavage (Figure 1c). For the endogenous AAVS1 locus, Mali et al. [6] achieved targeting efficiency of 10% to 25% in 293T cells, 13% to 8% in K562 cells, and 2% to 4% in induced pluripotent stem cells. Cong et al. [7] independently reported that the CRISPR/Cas system is able to mediate genomic cleavage with comparable or superior efficiency to a pair of TALENs targeting the same EMX1 locus. Cho et al. [8] used the CRISPR/Cas system to cleave two human genomic sites, CCR5 (C-C motif chemokine receptor type 5) and C4BPB (complement component 4 binding protein, beta), in a targeted manner for genome editing, but not at related off-target sites within the human genome that are most homologous to the 23-bp target sequences. All three groups show that the simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs into human cells can achieve multiplex gene editing of multiple targeted loci, establishing the potential of the CRISPR/Cas system for high-throughput applications. Mali et al. [6] and Cong et al. [7] also used a Cas9-mutant nuclease, nickase, to generate only single-strand breaks at a target locus, thereby promoting HR while minimizing NHEJ-mediated mutagenesis., Two other independent studies report RNA-guided genome engineering in microbial organisms and in zebrafish, demonstrating broad utility of the CRISPR/Cas technology (Figure 1d). Hwang et al. [9] tested the CRISPR/Cas9 system in vivo using zebrafish embryos and showed that it can induce targeted genetic modifications with efficiencies similar to that of ZFNs and TALENs. The authors successfully targeted more than 80% of the tested sites in zebrafish. They monitored the toxicity induced by gRNA:Cas9-encoding mRNA in zebrafish by observing the numbers of deformed and dead embryos. These frequencies were similar to those observed previously using ZFNs and TALENs. Jiang et al. [10] show the versatility of the CRISPR technique for bacterial genome engineering by introducing precise mutations in the genomes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Although the range of targetable sequences for the CRISPR/Cas system is somewhat constrained by the requirement of an NGG 3-bp motif (known as the protospacer adjacent motif, or PAM, sequence) in genomic DNA just 3' to the target site, it could potentially be expanded by using homologs with different PAM requirements., The target specificity of the CRISPR/Cas system is programmed with gRNA, without any need for enzyme engineering. Only one customized gRNA is required to target a specific sequence; the same Cas9 enzyme is suitable for all other sequence targets of the human genome. In contrast, ZFNs and TALENs require the design and assembly of two nucleases, one for each half of the target site. Furthermore, the target specificity of gRNAs is achieved by a 20-bp RNA-DNA interaction, which is encoded by short sequences of approximately 100 bp. gRNAs are therefore much simpler and easier to engineer than are ZFNs or TALENs. The short length of gRNA sequences also avoids difficulties associated with delivering longer and highly repetitive ZFN/TALEN-encoding vectors into cells. The specificity and versatility of gene editing by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, coupled with the ease-of-use, will likely encourage wider applications of the technology, especially by smaller laboratories with limited resources., But the most important question, especially for clinical translation, is as follows: how specific are these methods? In other words, do they cleave at sites in the genome other than the ones they are designed to target? Potential wide-ranging use of ZFNs, TALENs or CRISPR gene editing tools in clinical trials (ongoing clinical trials include ZFNs designed to knock-out CCR5 in human T cells and CD34+ stem cells to render these cells resistant to infection by HIV) warrants a systematic and careful evaluation of their cleavage specificity, through the determination both of the locations and of the frequencies of unwanted off-target events on a genome-wide scale. Off-target cleavage likely occurs at sites whose sequences differ slightly from the target sites or at partial target sites. To ensure safety, off-target cleavage analysis is essential for each and every newly targeted loci of the human genome. Of the three methods, off-target cleavage is most well characterized for ZFNs and to a much lesser extent for TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing may reveal off-target mutations induced by these gene editing tools. Such studies will be of utmost importance for safe human genome modification and potential clinical translation to gene therapy."

Eusociality in insects requires the evolution of two alternative phenotypes - workers, who sacrifice personal reproduction, and queens, who realize that reproduction. Extensive work on honeybees and ants has revealed the molecular basis of derived queen and worker phenotypes in highly eusocial lineages, but we lack equivalent deep-level analyses of wasps and of primitively eusocial species, the latter of which can reveal how phenotypic decoupling first occurs in the early stages of eusocial evolution., We sequenced 20 Gbp of transcriptomes derived from brains of different behavioral castes of the primitively eusocial tropical paper wasp Polistes canadensis. Surprisingly, 75% of the 2,442 genes differentially expressed between phenotypes were novel, having no significant homology with described sequences. Moreover, 90% of these novel genes were significantly upregulated in workers relative to queens. Differential expression of novel genes in the early stages of sociality may be important in facilitating the evolution of worker behavioral complexity in eusocial evolution. We also found surprisingly low correlation in the identity and direction of expression of differentially expressed genes across similar phenotypes in different social lineages, supporting the idea that social evolution in different lineages requires substantial de novo rewiring of molecular pathways., These genomic resources for aculeate wasps and first transcriptome-wide insights into the origin of castes bring us closer to a more general understanding of eusocial evolution and how phenotypic diversity arises from the same genome.","","Phenotypic plasticity is a fundamental biological process that allows organisms to adapt to changes in their environment [1, 2]. Examples of plastic phenotypes include insect castes [3, 4], horn-polyphenic beetles [5] and sex differences [6], where they play a crucial role in shaping the ecology and evolution of species and ecosystems. Understanding how alternative phenotypes arise from the same genome is one of the most challenging questions in modern biology [1, 2]., The most impressive examples of phenotypic plasticity are found in the eusocial Hymenoptera (ants, some bees and some aculeate wasps), where specialized reproductive or non-reproductive phenotypes (castes) play a pivotal role in the ecological success of these insects [7]. Eusocial insect castes usually arise through differential expression of shared genes [8, 9], but studies to date have been largely restricted to the highly eusocial bees and ants, where caste phenotypes are evolutionarily derived, being greatly modified from their ancestral state (for example, with morphological adaptations that are established early in development). Thus, some of the molecular processes underlying the origins of castes are likely to differ substantially from those underlying highly eusocial species [10, 11]. Understanding how castes first arise is best studied in primitively eusocial species, but little is known about their molecular evolution, particularly in the aculeate wasps [12–15]. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive gene-level studies on primitively eusocial wasps., In the evolution of eusociality, behavioral and physiological traits of the non-social ancestor become decoupled into complementary queen and worker phenotypes [16], but we understand little about the molecular patterns and processes by which this originates and to what extent molecular ground plans are re-organized. These questions are of general biological importance in understanding the evolution of phenotypic diversity [1, 2]. Empirical assessment of how gene transcription is decoupled into alternative phenotypes has been difficult to obtain because it requires unbiased quantification of gene expression (of both known and novel (undescribed) genes) across whole genomes [17]. Microarray analyses of the highly eusocial honeybee (Apis mellifera) and fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) suggest marked functional decoupling of molecular processes in queens and workers, involving large numbers of genes [18–21]. Little is known about the patterns and processes of transcriptional decoupling for castes in primitively eusocial insects [12, 14]. A simple prediction is that patterns of transcriptional and functional decoupling should be less pronounced than in highly eusocial species, because phenotypes are in the first stages of merely behavioral decoupling [9, 12]., Processes of phenotypic decoupling at the molecular level may occur via several mechanisms [5, 22]. Conserved toolkits of ancestral molecular processes may be redeployed to regulate similar alternative phenotypes across species and lineages [23–26]. In eusocial insects, conserved toolkit genes appear to be differentially expressed in castes across species, including bees and wasps [12, 27]. An alternative, untested prediction is that at least some of the molecular processes underlying social phenotypes, in different social lineages and among different levels of social complexity, will differ substantially. This is because extensive molecular and developmental re-wiring or new gene evolution may be required for the loss of phenotypic plasticity and elaboration of phenotype-specific traits [10, 28]. There may also be rapid evolution of genes associated with the emergence of alternative phenotypes [6, 17, 29], and there is evidence for this in the highly eusocial honeybees and fire ants [30, 31]. Finally, the importance of novel genes (that is, previously undescribed genes that lack any detectable protein-coding homologues from existing sequence data [32]) in the evolution of phenotypic innovations has recently emerged in animals as varied as yeast [33], hydra, reptiles [34–36], and also honeybees [37]. To date the eusocial insect literature has largely focused on conserved molecular pathways for social behavior [12, 26, 27, 38, 39], and the relative roles of the different mechanisms of phenotypic decoupling are unknown., We sequenced over 20 Gbp of genome-wide caste-specific transcripts from the primitively eusocial, tropical paper wasp Polistes canadensis using high-throughput sequencing technologies. Castes in Polistes differ only in behavior and are determined through differential gene expression during adulthood [12–14], making Polistes important models for studying the early stage in the evolution of eusociality and phenotypic plasticity [40]. Polistes originated in the tropics, and the secondary adaptations to diapause found in temperate species (for example, [41]) will be absent in P. canadensis [42]. Typically a few foundresses build and provision new colonies (Figure 1). One foundress becomes the primary egg-layer (queen). Emerging adults help raise the offspring of their mother queen, but retain the ability to become egg-layers [43–45]. Thus, Polistes castes represent an early stage of phenotypic decoupling in the evolution of eusociality [16].

                        Polistes canadensis. Queens and workers show specific behaviors - reproduction or provisioning, respectively. Foundresses show both worker and queen behaviors, and additionally build new nests, whilst callows (newly emerged females; <2 days old) exhibit none of these behaviors. Colonies are founded, and males and females produced, throughout the year with no seasonal diapause.
                    , Here, we generate a genome-wide catalogue of aculeate wasp genes expressed in adult females to provide a resource for genomic analyses. We then conduct the first RNA-seq analyses of caste-biased expression in a wasp and primitively eusocial insect to test the above hypotheses on the patterns and processes of molecular decoupling of alternative phenotypes at the early stages in the evolution of eusocial behavior. These datasets allow a first simultaneous assessment of the role of conserved genetic toolkits, novel genes and gene evolution when social behavior first evolves. We also use our data to re-assess the phylogenetic relationships between the three aculeate Hymenoptera subfamilies (bees, wasps and ants), which is vital information for interpreting common processes and lineage-specific novelties underlying the evolution of alternative phenotypes. Recently, there has been much debate over the relationships of aculeate bees, wasps and ants, challenging the morphology-based view that Vespoidea (ants plus aculeate wasps) are monophyletic [46, 47]. Genome sequences (or similar catalogue of genes) for aculeate wasps will help resolve this controversy and provide a basis for interpreting comparative data on social evolution., Our RNAseq analyses of phenotypic decoupling in P. canadensis provide some intriguing novel insights into the evolution of alternative phenotypes, and the early stages of caste evolution and sociality. First, they highlight the importance of novel genes in phenotypic diversity, emphasizing the need to expand existing genomic datasets beyond established model organisms to include a wider range of taxonomic groups. Secondly, they add important insights to the current emerging picture that much of the molecular changes that accompany social evolution occur predominantly in the worker rather than queen caste, with an over-representation of novel caste-biased genes in workers. These features may be important in facilitating the evolution of behavioral complexity in the worker caste. We show that these patterns are evident even at the early stages of sociality, where castes retain plasticity. Further, contrary to highly eusocial species, genes involved in caste differentiation do not appear to be subject to relaxed selection at the early stages of sociality. Diversity in the molecular regulation of castes across social lineages is expected if many pleiotropic genes involved with sexual conflict are lost in the early stages of social evolution, when ancestral monogamy is required to generate the conditions for the evolution of worker behavior [10]. Subsequent evolution of queen and worker behaviors, therefore, may take very different molecular pathways in different lineages, requiring new gene networks to evolve independently [28]. Further RNA-seq studies on other species (for example, [70]) and also genome sequencing to explore the potential role of alternative splicing (for example, [71]) will help determine the complementary roles of conserved and novel molecular processes in shaping social and other polyphenisms, bringing us closer to understanding how genomes give rise to phenotypic diversity in general."

A number of independent investigations focusing on specific genes, individual genomes, or specific functional categories from various eukaryotes have indicated that lateral gene transfer does indeed affect eukaryotic genomes. However, the lack of common methodology and criteria in these studies makes it difficult to assess the general importance and influence of lateral gene transfer on eukaryotic genome evolution., We used a phylogenomic approach to systematically investigate lateral gene transfer affecting the proteomes of thirteen, mainly parasitic, microbial eukaryotes, representing four of the six eukaryotic super-groups. All of the genomes investigated have been significantly affected by prokaryote-to-eukaryote lateral gene transfers, dramatically affecting the enzymes of core pathways, particularly amino acid and sugar metabolism, but also providing new genes of potential adaptive significance in the life of parasites. A broad range of prokaryotic donors is involved in such transfers, but there is clear and significant enrichment for bacterial groups that share the same habitats, including the human microbiota, as the parasites investigated., Our data show that ecology and lifestyle strongly influence gene origins and opportunities for gene transfer and reveal that, although the outlines of the core eukaryotic metabolism are conserved among lineages, the genes making up those pathways can have very different origins in different eukaryotes. Thus, from the perspective of the effects of lateral gene transfer on individual gene ancestries in different lineages, eukaryotic metabolism appears to be chimeric.","Genome evolution, phylogenomics, lateral gene transfer, eukaryotes, parasites","The protein-coding capacity of a genome is the product of a history of gene acquisitions and losses [1, 2]. New genes can be created de novo, through gene fusions, gene duplications, and lateral gene transfer (LGT), and collectively, they may contribute to adaptive innovations [1]. LGT is the transfer and fixation of genetic material between distinct lineages independent of their reproduction cycle. LGT is now widely accepted as a major factor shaping the gene content of prokaryotic genomes in both free-living and host-dependent lineages [3, 4]. Although LGT has not been studied so extensively among eukaryotes, it is already apparent that LGT has also affected eukaryotic genomes [5–7]. Thus, it has been recognized for some time that eukaryotic metabolism seems to be more similar to bacterial metabolism than to archaebacterial metabolism [8, 9]. These bacterial-like genes and pathways may represent the legacy of founding bacterial partners in eukaryogenesis [10] or result from endosymbiotic gene transfers (EGTs) [11, 12]. For example, it has been suggested that EGTs from the mitochondrial endosymbiont might be the source of around 600 to 800 protein-coding genes in eukaryotic nuclear genomes [12, 13], and gene transfer from photosynthetic endosymbionts has additionally affected the genome content of algae and plants [12]. Gene transfers from more recent bacterial endosymbionts have also affected the genomes of some eukaryotic lineages [7, 12]. Beyond endosymbiosis, it is clear that LGTs from diverse prokaryotes have also affected many protists [14–16]. Although many of these LGTs seem to represent homologous replacements of genes for existing pathways, there are also cases where LGT has conferred entirely novel functions. For example, the transfer of genes for bacterial-like nucleotide transporters to microsporidian parasites underpins their obligate intracellular lifestyle by allowing them to steal ATP from their host cells [17]. On a global economic scale, the LGT of genes for toxins between fungal plant pathogens has had a devastating impact on wheat production [18]., A range of different methods have been used to detect LGTs, with varying degrees of agreement between methods [19]. Detailed phylogenetic analyses are probably the most rigorous approach [19], but can be time-consuming for large numbers of genes, requiring a trade-off between analytical sophistication and speed. One solution has been to combine less sophisticated but rapid tree-building methods with fast non-tree-based approaches to provide a primary screen for potential LGTs that can then be subjected to more detailed analysis using better phylogenetic models [14, 15]. In the present investigation, we applied this combined approach to systematically identify LGTs affecting the genomes of 13 taxonomically diverse, mostly parasitic, microbial eukaryotes (Table 1), including a number of major parasites of humans and livestock [20]. Some of these parasites occupy different niches within their hosts, providing an opportunity to investigate how patterns of LGTs and potential donor lineages might be influenced by the habitat(s) in which they live. For comparison, we also analyzed the genome of Dictyostelium discoideum [21], a free-living amoebozoan relative of the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, which lives in soil. Some of the parasites we investigated, including species of Leishmania and Trypanosoma, are closely related to each other, providing comparative insight into LGT over shorter timescales. Our systematic analyses provide a detailed insight into the dynamics, role, and potential importance of LGT in the evolution of a sample of parasitic microbial eukaryotes, but also have general implications for understanding how eukaryotic genomes and metabolic pathways have evolved.Table 1

                  , To identify recent LGTs using a common methodology, we analyzed the published genomes of 13 microbial eukaryotes representing a broad range of eukaryotic lineages with diverse life cycles and habitats. The fraction of identified LGTs varied from 0.16% to 0.97% (average 0.38%) of protein-coding genes per genome, with an average contribution across the 13 genomes of 1 LGT per 357 protein-coding genes (Table 1; see Additional file 9). These proportions are relatively modest compared with the values reported for prokaryotes [50]. However, the number of identified LGTs may be dependent on the method of analysis and the criteria used to identify LGTs; it has already been shown that there is poor agreement between the number and identity of LGTs identified using different methods [3, 19]. We also found some discrepancies between the published data for the genomes we analyzed and our own results. The 357 LGTs reported here are based upon a very conservative interpretation of phylogenetic trees: we did not count poorly supported topologies even if they depicted the type of patchy taxonomic sampling that is consistent with LGT. For example, we did not include the bacterial-like ATP transporters shared by Microsporidia and bacterial obligate intracellular pathogens in our list, despite it being likely that LGT has occurred between prokaryotes and eukaryotes for these genes [17]. Some of the lack of resolution in our trees may reflect limited sampling combined with the well-known difficulties associated with phylogenetic analysis of the divergent molecular sequences of parasites [10]. In addition, we did not investigate LGTs involving segments or domains of proteins [51], although this is already thought to affect proteins with complex domain organization such as surface proteins [52, 53]. Thus, it is likely that our estimates provide only a conservative lower bound for the real number of LGTs that have affected the genomic content of the microbial eukaryotes investigated., The patterns for LGTs affecting closely related kinetoplastids and apicomplexans demonstrates that, as for prokaryotes [8], LGT is a dynamic process involving gain and loss over relatively short genetic distances. Those LGTs that have been retained after parasite diversification are likely to be functionally important for the parasites. LGT can be a powerful source of innovation by mediating rapid phenotypic changes, in contrast to the slower changes mediated by point mutations of existing genes [1, 3, 6]. In addition, approximately 35% of LGTs correspond to poorly characterized proteins, suggesting that there are important gaps in our knowledge of the function of genes shared between parasites and host-associated prokaryotes., Although some of the LGTs we detected seem to involve replacement of a previously existing host gene by a prokaryotic homolog (for example, argininosuccinate synthase (tree TN110) and thiol-peroxidase (tree TN225); see Additional file 5), other LGTs seem to have brought new capacities to the recipient eukaryote. For example, an LGT at the base of the kinetoplastids for a gene encoding the peptidase inhibitor ecotin, a known virulence-associated gene in Yersinia spp. [54], may provide kinetoplastids with resistance to some mammalian and insect host peptidases [40]. T. vaginalis provides a particularly compelling example, where LGTs seem to have greatly facilitated the ability of the organism to degrade the complex glycans that are present in the host mucosal secretions and host cell membranes [55–57]. Nine of the relevant T. vaginalis enzymes are the product of gene transfers, providing a striking example of an almost complete pathway that has been gained by LGTs from various prokaryotic donors. The activity of two of the Trichomonas enzymes has already been reported: β-galactosidase contributes to the degradation of mucus [55] and α-mannosidase is known to be secreted during in vitro growth [56]. The activity of a third enzyme of the pathway, N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidase, correlates with levels of erythrocyte lysis in vitro [57]., The taxonomy of some of the LGT donors was sufficiently well resolved to identify them as belonging to particular taxonomic groups and this allowed us to compare patterns of gene flow affecting specific parasites. Thus, several of the investigated parasites share a habitat with the complex and abundant prokaryotic community that lives in the gut of vertebrates [45] and on other mucosa [47], and this community is known to exchange genes frequently [58]. Our data show that important extracellular mucosal parasites, including E. histolytica, G. lamblia and T. vaginalis, which between them are responsible for over 500 million new infections annually [20], are sampling from the same pool of genes. In these species, ecology and lifestyle seem to strongly influence the opportunities for transfer and the origins of transferred genes. Thus, there is demonstrable enrichment in the genomes of E. histolytica, G. lamblia and T. vaginalis for LGTs from donors related to Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the dominant lineages in the gut microbiota of humans and other vertebrates [45]. Comparing LGTs detected for the gut parasite E. histolytica and its free-living relative D. discoideum also supports this distinction., Beyond its importance for understanding how the mucosal microbial community, which is vital for human health [30], evolves and functions, the widespread sharing of genes has implications for the development of transferred genes as potential drug targets for parasites [16, 59]. Thus, genes that are shared widely between parasites and indigenous prokaryotes may need to be avoided as drug targets in order to prevent the adverse affects, already seen with some antibiotics [30], on beneficial members of the human microbiota. In contrast to the mucosal parasites, the apicomplexans and the kinetoplastids were enriched in LGTs from proteobacterial donors. Plasmodium mosquito vectors were recently shown to have a gut microbiota that is highly enriched in proteobacteria [60]. However, comparing the taxonomy of the donor lineages for LGTs affecting the Apicomplexa and the Kintetoplastids identified no significant differences, although the tsetse fly vector for T. brucei harbors a bacterial flora enriched in Firmicutes [61] compared with proteobacteria [62]., Our analyses complement existing studies, which show that EGTs from the prokaryotic endosymbionts [11, 12, 41] that gave rise to plastids and mitochondria have had a major influence on eukaryotic metabolism, particularly but not exclusively [41] on energy metabolism. The genes that have been assigned to plastid or mitochondrial ancestry are typically those for which eukaryotes form a monophyletic group rooted in either the cyanobacteria or α-proteobacteria. In our own analyses, we did not include these contributions to eukaryotic genomes in our list of LGTs, focusing instead on transferred prokaryotic genes with much more limited taxonomic distribution among eukaryotes and hence more likely to be of recent origin. These types of LGTs were easier to detect using our approach than more ancient events, for which the limitations of data and phylogenetic models can combine to prevent robust inferences. Nevertheless, we did detect some strongly supported deeper transfers (for example, trees TN145, TN242, and TN253; see Additional file 5), and there are also reports of LGTs of algal origin into the base of the animal radiation [63]. There are, of course, no obvious reasons to suppose that barriers to LGT between prokaryotes and eukaryotes were any greater in the distant, as opposed to the more recent past., Our data strongly suggest that LGT from diverse prokaryotes has had a major effect on the origins of genes that make up metabolic pathways in contemporary eukaryotes. Thus, although the number of LGTs we detected for individual eukaryotic genomes was typically less than 1% of the genes analyzed, the significance of LGTs for eukaryotic metabolism can be better appreciated when the LGTs from all 13 genomes are shown together on a single metabolic map (Figure 2). All 11 categories of KEGG metabolic pathways have been affected by LGTs, with 44% of the 162 individual pathways containing at least one candidate LGT; gene transfer has left a strong imprint on eukaryotic metabolism (Figure 2). It has previously been suggested that genes for metabolic enzyme (operational genes) can be replaced by LGT more easily than genes for processes such as transcription and translation (informational genes) [8, 27]. If we make the (albeit simplistic) assumption (see Materials and methods) that all operational genes have similar rates of LGT, and use the average number of LGTs per genome from the current study, then sampling an additional 800 taxonomically diverse eukaryotic genomes would ensure (with 95% confidence) that every operational gene was affected by LGT in at least one genome. Thus, although many metabolic pathways are conserved across the eukaryote tree of life, our results suggest that the individual genes making up those pathways in different lineages will often have very different origins."

Genetic and molecular analyses have indicated that Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins are critical for the long-term maintenance of active gene expression states in many organisms. A generally accepted model suggests that TrxG proteins contribute to maintenance of transcription by protecting genes from inappropriate Polycomb group (PcG)-mediated silencing, instead of directly promoting transcription., Here we report a physical and functional interaction in Drosophila between two members of the TrxG, the histone methyltransferase ASH1 and the bromodomain and extraterminal family protein FSH. We investigated this interface at the genome level, uncovering a widespread co-localization of both proteins at promoters and PcG-bound intergenic elements. Our integrative analysis of chromatin maps and gene expression profiles revealed that the observed ASH1-FSH binding pattern at promoters is a hallmark of active genes. Inhibition of FSH-binding to chromatin resulted in global down-regulation of transcription. In addition, we found that genes displaying marks of robust PcG-mediated repression also have ASH1 and FSH bound to their promoters., Our data strongly favor a global coactivator function of ASH1 and FSH during transcription, as opposed to the notion that TrxG proteins impede inappropriate PcG-mediated silencing, but are dispensable elsewhere. Instead, our results suggest that PcG repression needs to overcome the transcription-promoting function of ASH1 and FSH in order to silence genes.","

The ability to maintain expression states is critical, since inappropriate loss or gain of gene activity may lead to developmental anomalies, tissue dysfunction, or uncontrolled cell growth such as cancer. The Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins and the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster but present in all higher eukaryotes, cooperate to sustain gene expression states by establishing and organizing information contained in the chromatin template. This epigenetic information layer assures the appropriate usage of the genetic blueprint, according to the developmental history of any given cell. TrxG proteins are required in order to maintain active states. This was discovered because of their essential trans-activating function for homeotic gene expression in flies [1]. Despite their common implication in gene activation, the TrxG encompasses a variety of different biochemical functions, ranging from chromatin remodeling and histone modification to mediator complex subunits and transcription factors [2]. Genetically, the TrxG acts antagonistic to the PcG of genes, which is essential for the maintenance of repressed expression states., The histone methyltransferases (HMTs) absent, small, or homeotic discs 1 (ash1) and trithorax (trx) represent histone modifying activities within the TrxG. Both HMTs have attracted particular attention, because they were considered to specifically counteract PcG silencing, rather than being coactivators of transcription [3]. Studies of ASH1 enzymatic activity supporting this view show that the histone modifications catalyzed by ASH1 disfavor Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) binding in-vitro, whereas association of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes incorporating TrxG subunits (BRAHMA, MOIRA) is preferred [4]. However, the in-vivo relevance of this observation remains unclear, since the targeting of PRC1 seems to primarily depend on transcription factors and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [5]. In addition, the assumed enzymatic specificity of ASH1 has lately been challenged by independent reports [6–8]., Alternative explanations on how ASH1 prevents PcG-mediated silencing propose that ASH1 blocks PRC-activity downstream to chromatin recruitment. A comparison of the HOX gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in active and repressed conditions supports this notion: PRC1 and PRC2 binding patterns at the Ubx locus do not change between Ubx ON or OFF states, whereas ASH1 is only located downstream of the active Ubx promoter in embryonic discs [9]. In addition, Ubx repression in the absence of ASH1 is accompanied by the formation of an ectopic H3K27me3 domain, a mark associated with mature PcG-mediated repression. Taken together, these data suggest that ASH1 actively prevents PcG silencing, however not by simply impairing PRC1/2 recruitment to chromatin., The functional relationship between PcG proteins and ASH1 has been addressed on a genome-wide scale by two recent ChIP-chip studies in Drosophila tissue culture cells. Both investigations support the proposed anti-repressor function of ASH1, either by showing that fully activated PcG target genes miss typical marks of PcG-mediated repression and instead become embedded in broad ASH1 domains [10], or by reporting that genes in 'balanced' states, characterized by simultaneous binding of PcG and TrxG proteins, are transcriptionally active [10, 11]. In both studies a clear indication for a more general involvement of ASH1 in transcription is missing. In accordance to this, analysis of the wing imaginal disc transcriptome of ash1 mutant flies only identified few deregulated genes, again supporting the idea that ASH1 is only needed at a subset of developmental regulators, which need to be protected from ectopic PcG repression [12]., Curiously, studies analyzing Ubx pattern formation in embryonic disc stages suggest ASH1 to act as a general transcription-promoting factor in analogy to what has been shown for TRX. Briefly, ncRNAs, originating from the bxd region upstream of the Ubx promoter, inhibit Ubx expression in cis presumably by transcriptional interference [13]. ASH1 localization downstream of the bxd ncRNA promoters correlates with the onset of ncRNA expression [14]. This behavior is reminiscent of TRX, which was already shown to promote bxd ncRNA expression, thereby silencing Ubx indirectly [15]. In the reverse Ubx ON situation, ASH1 was found to be enriched in the coding region of Ubx and a related GFP reporter gene, but absent from bxd ncRNAs. Hence, the correlation between ASH1 binding and transcriptional activity at functionally diverse genes (ncRNAs, homeotic selector, and reporter) is clearly indicative of a more general involvement in transcription., Another TrxG member, explicitly implicated in Ubx regulation, is female sterile (1) homeotic (fs(1)h) [16, 17]. Alleles of ash1 and fs(1)h show strong genetic interactions with respect to Ubx activity. These interactions have contributed to the proposal of a 'trithorax gene set' by Shearn, following the earlier idea of a repressive gene cohort around Polycomb [18]. However, attempts to link ASH1 and FSH on a biochemical level have not been successful to date [17]. The fs(1)h gene products belong to the BET family of proteins, named after their characteristic arrangement of a tandem bromodomain and the extra-terminal domain. Mammalian BET proteins have been shown to serve as chromatin adapter proteins by binding to acetylated histone tails and to facilitate gene expression [19]. Lately, inhibition of BET function has been identified as effective strategy to treat poor-prognosis leukemia, multiple myeloma, and squamous carcinomas [20–23]. How BET proteins contribute to normal development and tissue homeostasis is still poorly understood. Loss of function phenotypes in model organisms having a single BET gene, such as C. elegans BET-1 mutants and Drosophila fs(1)h mutants, demonstrate that BET function is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of cell fates [16, 24, 25]., By purifying ASH1 from a stable Drosophila cell line, we discovered a biochemical interaction between ASH1 and FSH, as previously suggested from genetic studies in fly mutants. In addition, we were able to show that both proteins extensively co-localize on chromatin, especially at sites bound by PcG complexes and gene promoters. The observed co-localization at promoters is a hallmark of active genes, but independent of gene type and function. These findings are at odds with the prevalent model that TrxG proteins function primarily as PcG-specific anti-repressors, but are dispensable in the absence of PcG-mediated repression. Our additional finding, that a set of PcG-repressed genes displays ASH1, FSH, and TRX-C signals comparable to their active counterparts, further questions the anti-repressor hypothesis. In agreement with a general transcription promoting function, we could show that BET inhibition in Drosophila tissue culture cells leads to an immediate and widespread gene repression, as well as delayed gene activation in reaction to environmental stimuli., Experiments using double mutants of the TrxG genes ash1 and fs(1)h demonstrated a strong genetic interaction, whereas attempts to demonstrate a biochemical interaction remained unsuccessful so far. By purifying tagged ASH1 from a stable cell line, we discovered the missing physical connection between the two transcriptional activators. Indeed, the study by Chang et al. [17] attempting to demonstrate this interaction by FSH-S purification might have failed because of inappropriate purification conditions, or deviating starting material with respect to our study., In line with our interaction proteomics results we show that ASH1 and FSH extensively co-localize on chromatin. Both proteins jointly target active gene promoters irrespective of gene function. Intron-rich, active genes tend to display ASH1and FSH signal distal to the TSS. Contrasting to our results, two recently published ChIP-chip studies have reported that ASH1 forms broad domains encompassing fully activated PcG target genes, or is bound at TSSs maintained in a 'balanced' state [10, 11]. This balanced state is distinguished by the co-existence of PcG and TrxG proteins as well as production of full-length mRNA. The investigators deduced from these results that ASH1 cannot be a general transcriptional activator, but instead functions as specific antagonist of PcG-mediated repression. This conclusion was backed up by earlier genetic experiments showing that ASH1 function is dispensable for Ubx activation in the absence of PcG-mediated repression [3]. Our ASH1 chromatin maps unequivocally identify ASH1 binding to genes as being highly predictive for transcriptional activity. In addition, we cannot confirm that this behavior is in any sense restricted to a defined set of target genes, such as genes under PcG-control. On the contrary, we detected strong ASH1/FSH signals at housekeeping genes, for instance Cyp12c1 (Figure 6C) and Spf45 (Figure 8A). We could extend the list by further components of cell metabolism like ribosomal subunits or histone genes (not shown). These findings strongly argue in favor of a general involvement of ASH1 and FSH in transcription. Support for this notion comes from a study examining the chromatin localization of ASH1L in a panel of human cell lines. By applying ChIP-qPCR the authors could show that ASH1L associates with the transcribed region of all active genes examined [33]. In addition, the distribution of ASH1L in transcribed chromatin was found to resemble that of H3K4me3. Our genome-wide, high resolution mapping study in fly cells comes to similar conclusions., Missing ASH1 signals at active transcription units have been used to argue against a general involvement of ASH1 in transcription. Our analysis of the S2-DRSC chromatin landscape suggests that previous mapping studies failed to detect these signals and therefore jumped to conclusions based on incomplete evidence. A reasonable explanation for the enhanced sensitivity of our mapping study might be the employment of next-generation sequencing technology instead of microarrays. Direct comparison of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has shown that ChIP-seq generally produces profiles with better signal-to-noise ratio and allows detection of more and narrower peaks [34]. Still, the lower measurement sensitivity/resolution is not sufficient to explain the magnitude of differences. Our investigation of the antibody Q4177, generated on behalf of the modENCODE consortium, suggests that poor target reactivity of the immunoreagent might be the major explanation for missed ChIP signals in the study by Kharchenko et al. [11] (Figure 1D). Schwartz et al. [10] however partially relied on the same antibodies as we did., Regarding the absolute number of reported binding sites we would like to note that we used a peak detection algorithm (MACS) that was developed to map human transcription factor (TF) binding sites in ChIP-seq data (see Materials and methods for details). Sequence specific TFs typically generate sharply restricted, Gaussian-like ChIP-seq signals. Therefore, the algorithm was ideally suited to detect ASH1, FSH signals at TSS. At the same time, it tends to break up more widely distributed signals, like the ones we described for intro-rich active genes, into closely spaced peak clusters. Hence, the absolute number of peaks reported in this study does not reflect the number of functional elements bound by ASH1 and FSH in a one-to-one correspondence., The second major argument against a general involvement of ASH1 in transcription was provided by the Ubx activity in ash1/E(z) double-mutant mitotic clones, located in- and outside of the endogenous Ubx expression domain [3]. In our opinion, this observation does not directly contradict the co-activator hypothesis favored by our data. It is conceivable that ASH1 and other TrxG proteins only modulate the transcriptional output, rather than being absolutely required for transcription. The incomplete, stochastic loss of Ubx activity in embryonic tissues devoid of ASH1 protein already argues against such a strict requirement [3, 29], and studies of heat shock response have already demonstrated a transcription modulating function for TRX [35]. The latter finding is especially intriguing, because trx/E(z) double-mutant clones show Ubx reactivation patterns similar to their ash1/E(z) counterparts [3]., Our unsupervised clustering of genes according to their combined TrxG/PcG binding profiles identified a class of transcription units with concurrent high PRC1 and TrxG enrichments at the promoter. In contrast to the 'balanced' state introduced by Schwartz et al. [10], these genes do not generate a transcript. We argue that the existence of this 'PcG-repressed' class provides additional evidence against the anti-repressor hypothesis. Instead, we favor the idea that fully installed PcG-repression needs to overcome the general co-activator function of TrxG proteins. We have previously identified Polycomb (Pc) interacting proteins by in-vivo biotinylation tagging [36]. Unexpectedly, this approach revealed FSH to interact with Pc in the Drosophila embryo. Our current analysis of FSH chromatin occupancy now shows that PRC1 and FSH co-localize at repressed promoters and intergenic gene regulatory elements, although they are known to fulfill antagonistic functions. Mechanistically this might suggest that PRC1 silences genes by blocking the elongation-promoting functions of FSH, for instance via the pTEF-b pathway. In the light of these deliberations it is sensible that PcG-bound promoters do show elevated levels of promoter proximal pausing, as we have reported earlier [28]. Future experiments using defined in-vitro transcription systems in conjunction with reconstituted PRC1 and FSH might shed light on the mechanistic details of this interaction., Our data provides evidence that FSH promotes the transcriptional activity of genes. How might this work at a mechanistic level? The human FSH-L homolog BRD4 proteins contain a conserved pTEF-b interacting domain in the very C-terminus, which is sufficient to directly recruit pTEF-b to target genes [37]. Following recruitment, pTEF-b triggers the transition from early elongation (promoter-proximal pausing) to productive elongation by phosphorylating Serine 2 residues in the RNA polymerase II CTD [38]. In addition, pTEF-b has been shown to phosphorylate DISF and NELF which releases the repressive factor NELF and converts DISF into a positive elongation factor. Studies in Drosophila have shown that pausing represents a widespread gene regulatory strategy. Our data are in line with this possible mechanism, since displacement of FSH leads to a widespread down-regulation of transcription. A recent study has shown that BRD4 is also able to directly phosphorylate Serine 2 of the Pol II CTD [39]. A kinase activity has also been demonstrated for FSH-S [17]. Using a defined in-vitro transcription system, it has been shown that the human BRD2, BRD3 render nucleosomes marked by acetylation permissive to the passage of elongating RNA polymerase II, thereby bypassing FACT requirement [40]. Taken together, FSH might therefore support the passage of two central checkpoints of the transcription cycle: first, it might be critical to release RNA polymerase II into productive elongation by initiating CTD phosphorylation and pausing factor release. Second, it potentially removes nucleosomal barriers in front of the elongating polymerase. In addition, the loss of ASH1 from promoters after FSH removal might indicate that the ASH1-FSH interplay stabilizes the association of ASH1 with chromatin. Additional evidence for cooperation between ASH1 and FSH during gene activation is provided by our recent study, applying regression models in order to predict gene expression based on chromatin binding profiles. In this quantitative modeling framework, the two proteins form an interaction pair [31]., Our JQ1 treatment of Drosophila tissue culture cells provides evidence, that transcriptome homeostasis is heavily affected by small molecule inhibition of BET proteins. This observation corresponds to our FSH chromatin map, since we observed a high correlation between FSH localization and gene activity. Exactly the same results have recently been described with respect to BRD4 in human CD4+ T cells and ES cells. ChIP-seq revealed that BRD4 localizes to active promoters and enhancers, and that expression levels are strongly correlated with BRD signal intensity [41]. BRD4 profiles across active human promoters display that BRD4 binds at the TSS. Here we show the same for FSH in Drosophila cells. The degree of correlation between BRD4 localization and transcriptional activity even encouraged the authors to predict that 'BRD4 could potentially be used as a genome-wide hallmark of active or poised genes'. Our gene clustering according to TrxG/PcG promoter binding supports this idea. Interestingly, our clustering into active and PcG-repressed genes parallels the human classification into active and poised genes in a sense that poised genes are occupied by BET proteins, but do not produce mRNA. Disruption of BRD4 chromatin binding by JQ1 in CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced expression of more than a thousand genes in CD4+ T cells [41]. Again, we have reporter similar observation using JQ1 treatment in fly cells. In contrast, knockdown of FSH did not result in comparable transcriptional repression. We argue that the deviating results are due to the different natures of the treatment. Small molecule inhibition happens almost instantaneously. By monitoring the system in a time-resolved manner it is possible to untangle primary and secondary effects. Effective depletion of target proteins by RNAi can only be achieved within time scales of days. Therefore RNAi experiments rather disclose a novel steady-stead of the reduced network than primary effects. Similar thoughts should be considered when interpreting expression profiles obtained from zygotic mutants, since maternal gene products are present during development. Like in RNAi-mediated knockdowns it becomes impossible to define a time point that corresponds to functional null situation, but is not governed by secondary effects., A recent study in erythroid cells shows, that BRD3 is recruited to target promoters by reading an acetyl mark on the transcription factor GATA1, instead of being primarily dependent on histone acetylation [42]. The concentration of FSH signals around TSSs fits the idea that acetylated transcription factors might also contribute to BET protein recruitment in flies., There is substantial evidence that TrxG proteins play global roles in transcription. In the future it will be interesting to find out, why this group of proteins genetically scores as being important for the maintenance of the active state of HOX genes, or in other words, what discriminates them from other factors in functional proximity to RNA polymerase. More mechanistic insight how TrxG complexes are connected to transcription machinery will be necessary to answer this question. It might indeed turn out that TrxG complexes 'are among those that have emerged as being important for maintenance for a relatively uninteresting reason e.g., because even relatively subtle changes in the expression of Drosophila HOX genes cause homeotic transformations' [1]."

From Prometheus through to the yellow spandex-clad mutant Wolverine, our heroes and icons through history embody our deep desire to overcome the biological frailties that make us susceptible to physical, pathological and age-related damage. Those aspiring to Prometheus-like self-renewal now have cause for optimism, thanks to a nexus of ideas currently in circulation that promise to allow regenerative medicine to impact upon our lives in ways that were previously confined to science fiction. For example, we now understand some developmental fate signaling mechanisms well enough to generate specific structures in vitro from stem cells [1]., While the growth or engineering of new functional adult tissues is at the core of ongoing work, it is becoming clear that functional integration with systemic biological functions, such as the immune, circulatory and nervous systems, adds an extra level of complexity we have only limited insight into. For example, while we can produce optic cups from stem cells [1], integrating these structures into adult tissue is an entirely more complex problem. Perhaps the most obvious way to achieve a complete understanding of regeneration and functional integration is to study those animals, such as hydra, planarians, annelids, starfish and urodele amphibians, where robust regenerative abilities are de rigueur. The last of these groups, urodele amphibians, is the subject of an article published in this issue of Genome Biology [2] that sheds new light on the genomic basis of regeneration in this lineage., Major model organisms, which we traditionally associate with progress in our understanding of fundamental cellular and developmental mechanisms, are conspicuously absent from the above list of animals capable of regeneration. Historically, animals that regenerate were broadly ignored by developmental biologists, as their life history traits afforded none of the features that allowed first classical and then modern molecular genetic approaches. In fact, among animal species, currently only the zebra fish offers the opportunity to study profound limb and organ regeneration with a fully established set of genomic and molecular genetic tools [3]., Among the list of regenerators, urodele amphibians, consisting of newts and salamanders (axolotls), are the closest group to mammals, and so arguably are of greatest interest to regenerative medicine. One of the key remaining questions in urodele research is how conserved molecular regenerative mechanisms, albeit latent in mammals with regard to profound regeneration, are combined with novel lineage-specific molecular components. These two distinct contributions (referred to by Professor Jeremy Brockes, of University College London, as the 'newt within' for conserved features and 'eye of newt' for features particular to urodele/regenerative lineages) imply different approaches to how we might achieve regeneration in humans. Progress on this issue has been slow, as a comparative genomic approach using urodeles has been impeded by a lack of well-defined genome-level data. Even now, with sequencing costs plummeting and throughput rocketing, the genome sizes of urodeles are prohibitively large for effective sequencing. The smallest reported urodele genome is that of the pygmy salamander, Desmognathus wrighti, at approximately 13 Gbp, with the lowest estimates for the species most often employed in regeneration studies, Ambystoma mexicanum and Notophthalmus viridescens, at over 20 Gbp and 30 Gbp, respectively [4]. When these genomes are eventually sequenced, the assembly and annotation problems will be on a scale that has not previously been tackled in the animal kingdom. In an article published in this issue of Genome Biology, however, Looso et al. [2] make a serious contribution to reinvigorating the study of urodele regeneration through taking an alternative approach to genome sequencing. They present a comprehensive transcriptome complemented with proteomic data, establish a basis for effective genome-wide expression studies in the newt N. viridescens and identify many urodele-specific genes. The study data bring newts to the forefront as a reference for comparative genomics with a view to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of regeneration., Looso et al. combined a previous expressed sequence tag (EST)-based approach with new data from the 454/Roche and Illumina platforms. These different data sources allowed a cross-platform approach that took advantage of the strengths of some approaches to compensate for the weaknesses of others. Perhaps most importantly, Looso et al. looked at different tissues, incorporating ESTs from a regenerating heart time course from a previous study [5], and 454/Roche data from a normalized library of a range of developmental, regeneration and adult tissues. Finally, well over half a billion paired-end Illumina reads from ventral and dorsal regions of the regenerating lens provided impressive coverage., Various assembly approaches resulted in a dataset of 120,922 transcripts; of these, just under one-third had their homology verified to existing protein coding genes and ESTs in NCBI databases by BLAST algorithms. Searching for Gene Ontology terms in UniProt databases enabled functional annotations to be assigned to just over one-quarter of transcripts. Together, the two annotation strategies enabled the annotation of about 40% of all transcripts. An analysis of gene discovery rate and coverage against known signaling pathways and conserved gene families confirmed that the study had yielded a high level of gene discovery, as well as very respectable coverage. Finally, the study also directly confirmed the coding potential of almost 12% of all transcripts using a high throughput mass spectrometry approach., In line with expectations, conserved signaling and developmental gene networks appeared to be well represented in the new dataset, and these will help greatly in ongoing studies of newt regeneration. In other words, the transcriptome study has provided researchers with plenty of very helpful data to assess the 'newt within' contribution to regeneration. But what does it teach us about novel genes and mechanisms for the 'eye of newt' contribution? Looso et al. addressed this question by focusing on those transcripts confirmed by mass spectrometry to be bona fide protein coding transcripts. Even with this conservative approach, which at this stage excluded most novel transcripts that are likely to be protein coding, over 826 sequences were found to be entirely unique or to only have homology within urodeles (Figure 1). Only 131 of these contained domains described in the Pfam database.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Distilling novel 'eye of newt' components of the newt transcriptome. Looso et al. [2] identified 826 novel protein-coding sequences with either no similarity to other species or similarity to urodeles only. Of those, 131 contained known motifs, while the rest did not. RT-PCR experiments on a select group of novel transcripts identified the tissues where these genes are expressed. These transcripts included those encoding a protein containing an activin receptor domain, a candidate family of new proteins with no known domains (five transcripts), three proteins containing the fascin domain and three proteins containing the EF-hand domain. Red boxes show expression of the tested transcripts in a homeostatic organ. Blue boxes demonstrate significant upregulation or downregulation (upward or downward arrow) of the tested transcripts in regenerating tissues. D and V stand for dorsal and ventral lens, respectively.
                    , Iterative BLAST searches within the remaining transcripts identified several potential new protein families. Of note, the transcripts within one such family shared a common signal peptide sequence. The authors performed RT-PCR analysis to look at the expression of some of these urodele-specific genes and potential new gene families, forming the basis for future detailed analyses of potential roles in newt regeneration (Figure 1)., Previous work investigating the function and structure of Prod1 (a urodele-specific regulator of limb regeneration) demonstrates that lineage-specific genes can have central roles in key aspects of newt regeneration, and serves as a blueprint for studies investigating how these genes might interact with conserved signaling pathways [6, 7]. The Prod1 findings underpin the hypothesis that taxon-specific machinery will play key roles in regeneration, by plugging into conserved molecular machinery. The dataset produced by Looso et al. is an important step in testing this hypothesis by allowing the identification of the usual suspects shared with mammals ('the newt within') and by clearly showing that there are plenty of evolutionary novelties in urodeles ('eye of newt'). Possession of a tool of the caliber of Looso et al.'s transcriptome will not only facilitate the description of newt-specific regeneration genes and conserved regeneration genes, but - crucially - will also help comparative work with other species. Such an approach could advance our comprehension of the evolution of regeneration and might help us answer questions about changes in regenerative ability. For example, why can the newt undergo lens regeneration throughout its life, whereas the axolotl, its close relative, can only do so at restricted developmental stages [8, 9]? Quite literally, in this example, we might ask: What is so special about the eyes of newts?, Animal regeneration, as far as we understand it, involves many conserved genetic circuits. For example, axial regeneration in planarians can be explained in terms of highly conserved signals and transcription factors. However, unsurprisingly, the detailed study of regeneration has almost exclusively (with notable exceptions) dealt with conserved candidate genes, biasing data toward support of this idea. Pleiotropic redeployment of conserved gene networks, together with evolutionary changes in their activity in adult tissues, may underpin the evolution of increased or decreased regenerative ability in some lineages. If this is the case, there may also have been ample opportunity for the incorporation of taxon-specific molecular novelties. Rather than just being a matter of evolutionary interest, the extent to which either of these possibilities is true will have a broad impact upon how we approach the prospect of enhancing regeneration in mammals. Happily, urodele regeneration researchers are now equipped with considerable ammunition with which to pursue these questions."

Genes involved in Nod factor and polysaccharide biosynthesis, denitrification and type III, IV, and VI secretion systems also vary within and between species. Symbiotic phenotyping and mutational analyses indicated that some type IV secretion genes are symbiosis-related and involved in nitrogen fixation efficiency. Moreover, there is a correlation between the presence of type IV secretion systems, heme biosynthesis and microaerobic denitrification genes, and symbiotic efficiency., Our results suggest that each Sinorhizobium strain uses a slightly different strategy to obtain maximum compatibility with a host plant. This large genome data set provides useful information to better understand the functional features of five Sinorhizobium species, especially compatibility in legume-Sinorhizobium interactions. The diversity of genes present in the accessory genomes of members of this genus indicates that each bacterium has adopted slightly different strategies to interact with diverse plant genera and soil environments.","","The rhizobia are symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria that form root and/or stem nodules on leguminous plants. Within nodules rhizobia convert atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) gas into ammonia, resulting in improved plant growth and productivity, even under N-limiting environmental conditions. These bacteria are among the largest fixers of atmospheric N2 gas in the biosphere and account for the deposition of nearly 100 to 195 teragrams per year. The effective use of biological nitrogen fixation via application of rhizobia leads to sustainable cropping systems with a net positive impact on the environment [1]. Most currently recognized legume-nodulating bacteria belong to the α-proteobacteria and are members of the genera Allorhizobium, Azorhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium (renamed Ensifer), or Bradyrhizobium [2, 3]. Recently, some members of the β- and γ-proteobacteria have also been shown to nodulate legume plants [4]., Members of the genus Sinorhizobium are among the most studied and first sequenced rhizobia. Sinorhizobium meliloti (previously Rhizobium meliloti and now Ensifer meliloti) and its close relative Sinorhizobium
                medicae induce the formation of root nodules on Medicago species, including Medicago truncatula and Medicago sativa (alfalfa) [5]. In contrast, Sinorhizobium saheli and Sinorhizobium terangae form root and stem nodules with woody leguminous plants, such as Sesbania or Acacia [6], while Sinorhizobium fredii has a very wide host range, nodulating more than 79 plant genera representing all three subfamilies of the family Leguminosae. Although whole genome sequences of some strains of S. meliloti, S. medicae and S. fredii have been published [7–12], and many of their genetic features have been well characterized, only a limited number of strains of each species have been well characterized at the genome level. Recently, Tian et al. [12] reported the comparative genomics of nine strains of S. fredii and Baily et al. [13] reported the population genomics of 12 S. medicae strains analyzed using Roche 454 technology. Moreover, only limited comparative genomics studies among each species exist and there are no reports of genomic feature of other species of Sinorhizobium, including the important symbionts of Sesbania/Acacia., Most rhizobial nodulation genes (nod, noe, and nol) are involved in the synthesis of host-specific lipochitinoligosaccharide (LCO) Nod factors essential for initial infection [14]. Bacterial genes encoding various polysaccharides, cyclic β-glucans, and type III, IV and VI secretion systems are also involved in symbiosis and host specificity [15–17]. Most of the genes involved in symbiosis are located on large self-transmissible megaplasmids (pSym), or within large genomic symbiotic islands [18]. The megaplasmid pSymA, which has the most symbiosis-related genes in S. meliloti, is a more variable replicon than the chromosome or pSymB in this bacterium [10]. Symbiosis-related genes have previously been shown to be highly variable among rhizobial species and strains [10, 19] and acquired by via horizontal gene- and plasmid-transfer events. This results in gene replacement and rearrangements leading to genome plasticity [18] and recombination [12] and, ultimately, specificity of symbiotic interactions with their legume hosts. This suggests that gene content in Sinorhizobium strains should vary among strains or species and these alterations could influence their symbiotic phenotype on a host plant. However, few comparative genomic studies have focused on gene content or symbiotic function of multiple strains within or between species of sinorhizobia., Here we describe the assembly and annotation of the whole genomes of 48 strains of Sinorhizobium described previously [20], with primary focus on S. meliloti and S. medicae. While we previously examined 44 of these genomes to characterize population diversity at the single nucleotide level and to determine the forces driving adaptive evolution, our overall goal here was to compare gene content among a large number of strains within a single sinorhizobial species. This was done to better understand functional features in each species and to identify symbiosis-associated genes contributing to symbiotic phenotypes as part of large genome-wide association, SNP, and Hapmap studies [20–22]. Here we show: 1) the genomic features of each Sinorhizobium species; 2) the differences in gene content between S. meliloti and the taxonomically and symbiotically related species S. medicae; and 3) the differences among strains and species in genes involved in Nod factor biosynthesis, polysaccharide biosynthesis, protein secretion systems, anaerobic denitrification, and organic sulfur utilization. We also report pair-wise analyses of symbiotic associations of these 46 S. meliloti and S. medicae strains with 27 diverse M. truncatula genotypes to better understand the relationship of symbiotic phenotype with bacterial genome content., The results of comparative genomics analysis of the Sinorhizobium genus provide useful information for understanding the genetic functional features of a wide variety of Sinorhizobium species strains, and a tool to better understand incompatibility in legume-rhizobia interactions. The correlation between the presence of T4SS and symbiotic efficiency suggest that each Sinorhizobium strain uses a slightly different strategy to obtain maximum compatibility with a host plant. Moreover, these large genomic data sets provide the opportunity to understand the evolution of rhizobia [20] together with mechanisms of host determination, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation. Our overall goal is to combine these data with our previous studies reporting SNPs in M. truncatula [21] and the sinorhizobia reported here [20] to provide a resource for genome-wide association mapping of genes and traits associated with symbiosis and nodulation. Moreover, the information provided here will be useful to study the population genomics of this bacterium and its evolution with Medicago."

                  Notophthalmus viridescens, an urodelian amphibian, represents an excellent model organism to study regenerative processes, but mechanistic insights into molecular processes driving regeneration have been hindered by a paucity and poor annotation of coding nucleotide sequences. The enormous genome size and the lack of a closely related reference genome have so far prevented assembly of the urodelian genome., We describe the de novo assembly of the transcriptome of the newt Notophthalmus viridescens and its experimental validation. RNA pools covering embryonic and larval development, different stages of heart, appendage and lens regeneration, as well as a collection of different undamaged tissues were used to generate sequencing datasets on Sanger, Illumina and 454 platforms. Through a sequential de novo assembly strategy, hybrid datasets were converged into one comprehensive transcriptome comprising 120,922 non-redundant transcripts with a N50 of 975. From this, 38,384 putative transcripts were annotated and around 15,000 transcripts were experimentally validated as protein coding by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Bioinformatical analysis of coding transcripts identified 826 proteins specific for urodeles. Several newly identified proteins establish novel protein families based on the presence of new sequence motifs without counterparts in public databases, while others containing known protein domains extend already existing families and also constitute new ones., We demonstrate that our multistep assembly approach allows de novo assembly of the newt transcriptome with an annotation grade comparable to well characterized organisms. Our data provide the groundwork for mechanistic experiments to answer the question whether urodeles utilize proprietary sets of genes for tissue regeneration.","","The regenerative potential of urodele amphibians and especially newts as adult individuals has been known for more than 200 years. The complete regeneration of entire appendages [1] is one of the landmark abilities of newts accompanied by their ability to regenerate parts of the central nervous system [2, 3], the lens [4] and the heart (reviewed in [5, 6]). Compared to other animal models [7, 8] the potential of the adult red spotted newt for regeneration is remarkable. Newts do not lose the capacity to regenerate the lens even after repetitive tissue damage that continues over several years. Lenses remain indistinguishable in their molecular signature and morphology even after repetitive rounds of regeneration [9]. In sharp contrast, the ability of mammalian species to regenerate declines rapidly during postnatal life, suggesting that the regenerative capacity in mammalians is inversely proportional to the age of an individual. At present, it is still unclear whether regeneration in mammals is a mere extension of embryonic development or represents an independent process. It seems likely that a thorough analysis of the molecular mechanisms of newt tissue regeneration will aid our understanding of regenerative processes and help to develop new therapeutic strategies., Although the regenerative capability of the newt is extraordinary, it has attracted less attention than other model organisms in recent decades. This is partly due to the comparatively long reproductive cycle of newts and their enormous genome size, estimated to reach c × 1010 bases, which is about 10-times the size of the human genome. Therefore, no genome sequencing approach has so far been initiated and only about 140 annotated transcript and protein sequences are available in public databases (NCBI, as of September 2011). To overcome these obstacles, several initiatives were launched to obtain more detailed 'omics' data. A set of 11,000 EST sequences [10] was uploaded to public databases and a mass spectrometry-driven proteomics approach was able to identify peptides for more than 1,000 newt proteins [11]. Furthermore, we devised a comprehensive newt data depository providing the ability to store, retrieve, link and visualize sequences, proteins and expression data [12]. This repository allows implementation of comprehensive datasets derived from next generation sequencing experiments and high-throughput proteomics., Sequencing technologies have seen rapid progress in recent years with respect to the amount of base calls and price. Despite these advancements and dramatic price cuts, the large size of the newt genome still plagues de novo genome projects and makes them hardly affordable. An obvious solution to this problem is the analysis of transcriptomics data, but a detailed analysis of such data is difficult in the absence of a comprehensive reference dataset. The availability of a detailed reference transcriptome of the newt Notophthalmus viridescens would also yield functional insights and allow identification of new and known proteins that might be instrumental in tissue regeneration of urodelian amphibians., Here, we present the de novo assembly of the newt transcriptome, based on hybrid sequencing datasets derived from Sanger, 454 Roche and Illumina platforms. Our approach, which generated over 38,000 unique transcripts with high quality annotations, covers embryonic and larval development, different stages of heart, appendage and lens regeneration and a comprehensive collection of tissue-specific transcripts. To exclude sequencing artifacts and verify coding sequences, transcriptome data were matched to a large mass spectrometry-derived proteomics dataset, resulting in the identification of 14,471 newt transcripts with approved protein-coding capacity. Further bioinformatical analysis disclosed several new protein families exclusive to urodelian amphibians, of which some contain known domains from public databases, but also entirely new clusters of proteins sharing sequence motifs not known in other species. We reason that some of the proprietary newt proteins might play important roles in regeneration processes unique to urodeles., High-throughput sequencing has become an indispensable tool for whole-genome analysis of complex organisms, a trend that has also been fuelled by decreasing sequencing costs. Nevertheless, de novo whole-genome analysis is still costly and needs specific bioinformatical expertise and dedicated computational equipment, especially for organisms with very large genomes. Alternatively, de novo whole-transcription analysis represents an attractive option to gain detailed insights into the genetic constitution of an organism at a fraction of the costs and efforts needed for whole-genome analysis. In fact, this approach has made several organisms amenable for molecular analysis that have not been the subject of genome projects despite the valuable information that might be gained by comprehensive genetic analysis. Examples include exotic insects [26], crustaceans [27], planarians [28] and several more. Transcriptomes of such organisms were decoded by mapping transcripts to a reference genome of phylogenetic close relatives or by de novo assembly of transcripts. Assembled transcriptomes are used as reference sets for RNA expression analysis, as matrices for mass spectrometric-driven peptide/protein identifications or for phylogenetic analyses. The availability of annotated transcriptomes also enables RNAseq analyses of niche organisms, which bypasses previous limitations due to the lack of high-density microarrays., The red spotted newt, N. viridescens, is an organism with remarkable tissue regeneration abilities. Although the regenerative potential of this animal has been known since 1712 [29–31] and was intensively investigated from the 1950s to the 1980s [32–39], no genome or larger sequencing project on it has been initiated so far, which is mainly due to the very large genome size (approximately c × 1010 bp) of newts. Here we describe the first comprehensive de novo assembled transcriptome together with a large-scale experimental validation of coding sequences., Since the content and quality of a de novo assembled transcriptome strongly depends on the input material, choice of sequencing platforms and bioinformatical processing, we devised an integrated strategy to achieve the best possible outcome. First, we used complex RNA pools covering embryonic and larval development, the entire process of heart, appendage and lens regeneration and a comprehensive collection of tissue-specific transcripts to limit the problem of incomplete representation of mRNAs. Furthermore, cDNA libraries were normalized to increase the probability to detect mRNAs expressed at low levels or in a small number of cells. Second, we combined the output from different sequencing platforms, which each have specific advantages: long reads with high accuracy were obtained by Sanger sequencing; medium read lengths from normalized cDNA libraries at medium depth were generated by the 454 platform; and short paired end reads with high sequencing depth were generated from the Illumina platform. Third, we tested five different assembly strategies in combination with several assembler software packages since most de novo assembly tools are not suited to process data from different platforms and the choice of adjustable parameters of the bioinformatics tool has a significant impact on the success of a de novo assembly. Our assembly strategy, which is based on preassembly of single sequencing sets using custom-configured assemblers followed by subsequent hybrid assembly into one transcriptome, outperformed a 'reference mapping' like approach based on sequences available for a close relative of the newt (C. pyrrhogaster). We obtained larger N50 values than in reference mapping approaches without a significant reduction in the overall number of unique transcripts., The length, distribution and number of de novo generated transcripts give only a rough estimate about the quality of a de novo transcriptome assembly. It is crucial to accomplish a comprehensive annotation of all transcripts and validate putative coding RNAs. To achieve this goal we used multiple BLAST algorithms and fine-tuned e-value thresholds, allowing detection of protein coding transcripts with different degrees of evolutionary conservation. The annotation rate of 56% that we achieved is similar to other published transcriptome assemblies (Schmidtea mediterranea, 6,729 annotated from 18,619 transcripts [28]), although we could not rely on comprehensive annotation of closely related organisms. Furthermore, the good coverage (around 80%) of components of known signal transduction pathways indicates that we identified the majority of protein coding transcripts that exist in N. viridescens. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that we might have missed transcripts or proteins that are only lowly expressed in the tissues studied, which might compromise our goal of achieving a comprehensive list of newt protein coding genes to a certain extent. In this context it is interesting to note that even well annotated model organisms such as zebrafish and mouse still carry a large number of non-annotated transcripts. For example, 40% of all transcripts present on the Affymetrix Mouse 430-2 array have either no gene symbol (5,553 probe sets), or only automatically assigned symbols such Riken (3,494 probe sets), predicted (506 probe sets), hypothetical (322 probe sets), expressed (505 probe sets), cDNA (175 probe sets) and families with similarity (230 probe sets). The Affymetrix Zebrafish Genome Array shows an even higher rate of almost 45% weakly annotated transcripts. From 15,122 entries, 2,773 lacked any gene symbol and 3,972 had only automatically assigned symbols (wu:fa, si:zfos, sb:cb and others). Expression analysis of a selected subset of newly identified genes by RT-PCR and microarray analysis revealed tissue-specific expression patterns as a pronounced response to heart and lens regeneration. A more thorough analysis of newly annotated transcripts during tissue renewal will help to define the regulatory network of genes controlling regeneration., Taken together, our assembly and annotation strategy yielded annotated transcripts that are close to organisms with complete genome information, although the focus of our approach was to obtain transcripts with high quality annotation rather than a maximum number of transcripts. We do not claim that we have assembled and annotated the complete transcriptome since no sufficient sequence similarity fulfilling our significance criteria (e-15) was found for 44% of all assembled sequences (>400 bp) but our dataset is sufficient to serve as a matrix for high-resolution expression analyses., It seems reasonable to assume that a significant part of the non-annotated transcripts represent artifacts generated by misassemblies. Alternatively, such sequences might also represent non-coding RNAs or mRNAs coding for newt- or urodele-specific proteins. However, we did only find a limited number of non-coding RNAs. Screening for non-coding RNAs using the noncode database [40] yielded 17 and 24 hits with high sequence similarity when transcripts <400 bp and >400 bp were used, respectively. This lead us to the conclusion that many of our non-annotated sequences represent weakly conserved 5'/3' UTRs or that the newt has a large number of RNAs with yet unknown function and similarity to other organisms. Since the lack of information about newt proteins makes it difficult to distinguish between these possibilities, we took advantage of a large set of proteomics data from newts obtained by mass spectrometry. This approach not only enabled us to validate almost 15,000 transcripts as protein coding but also enabled the identification of 826 urodelian-specific proteins, which showed either no sequence similarity at all (583 transcripts) or similarities to urodele EST sequences only (243 transcripts). We would like to emphasize that these numbers most likely represent only the tip of the iceberg since the current sensitivity and dynamic range of mass spectrometry only allows measurement of high abundance proteins. Some of the validated new proteins belong in new protein families, while others contain defined protein motifs (15%) or no discernable primary sequence feature. The detection of new protein families was particularly intriguing and might indicate that founding members of the newly discovered families evolved further during urodele evolution to cope with species-specific requirements. In fact, it has been postulated that urodeles acquired regenerative capacity at the time when ancestral salamanders separated from the vertebrate tree [41], although more authors prefer the hypothesis that regeneration is a primordial property of metazoa [42], which was lost in most tetrapod vertebrates during evolution but selectively maintained in salamanders. Interestingly, previous studies identified newt-specific genes such as Prod1, a critical determinant of proximodistal identity in the limb bud, that mediates nerve-dependent signals to the regenerating blastema by utilizing a conserved signaling machinery [43]. Another example is nsCCN, a newt specific member of the CCN protein family that is exclusively expressed in regenerating but not in uninjured hearts [44]. Further functional studies will reveal whether the newly discovered families are drivers of regenerative processes or serve another, yet unknown cause. Of course, our conclusions are based on currently available sequence data, leaving the possibility that the newly discovered urodelian-specific proteins exist also in other species that have not been analyzed so far. The newly established de novo transcriptome of N. viridescens will be an indispensable resource for better understanding regenerative events in newts and facilitate the identification of molecules, conserved or urodele-specific, that control this fascinating process. We would also like to suggest that the combined use of transcriptomics and proteomics approaches provides a powerful means to address new model organisms and detect new protein coding genes., Despite several obstacles to manipulate and analyze the red spotted newt, N. viridescens, at the molecular level, its remarkable tissue regeneration abilities define this organism as an excellent model to study regeneration. The rapidly evolving techniques for genome/proteome analysis and genetic manipulation will help to understand regenerative processes at a functional level. Here, we describe the first comprehensive de novo assembled transcriptome of N. viridescens combined with large-scale experimental validation of coding sequences. The use of complex RNA pools and normalized cDNA libraries allowed us to cover different biological processes, including embryonic development, as well as heart, appendage and lens regeneration. De novo assembly of the newt transcriptome using different computational strategies was facilitated by combination of the output from different sequencing platforms, which each have specific advantages. The resulting 56% annotation rate of the transcriptome is similar to other transcriptome assemblies (S. mediterranea, 6,729 annotated from 18,619 transcripts [28]), which are less challenging compared to the newt. Finally, integration of transcriptomics and proteomics data allowed us to confirm the protein coding potential of almost 15,000 transcripts, resulting in the identification of 826 urodelian-specific proteins. Several of these newly identified proteins represent new members of defined protein families or completely new protein families and show distinct expression profiles during regeneration. The newly established transcriptome of N. viridescens provides a matrix for high-resolution expression analyses and will be an indispensable resource for a better understanding of regenerative processes in newts at the molecular level."

To reconstruct the genome composition of metazoan ancestors, we sequenced the genome and transcriptome of the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, a close relative of metazoans that forms rosette-shaped colonies of cells., A comparison of the 55 Mb S. rosetta genome with genomes from diverse opisthokonts suggests that the origin of metazoans was preceded by a period of dynamic gene gain and loss. The S. rosetta genome encodes homologs of cell adhesion, neuropeptide, and glycosphingolipid metabolism genes previously found only in metazoans and expands the repertoire of genes inferred to have been present in the progenitors of metazoans and choanoflagellates. Transcriptome analysis revealed that all four S. rosetta septins are upregulated in colonies relative to single cells, suggesting that these conserved cytokinesis proteins may regulate incomplete cytokinesis during colony development. Furthermore, genes shared exclusively by metazoans and choanoflagellates were disproportionately upregulated in colonies and the single cells from which they develop., The S. rosetta genome sequence refines the catalog of metazoan-specific genes while also extending the evolutionary history of certain gene families that are central to metazoan biology. Transcriptome data suggest that conserved cytokinesis genes, including septins, may contribute to S. rosetta colony formation and indicate that the initiation of colony development may preferentially draw upon genes shared with metazoans, while later stages of colony maturation are likely regulated by genes unique to S. rosetta.","","Metazoan multicellularity and development are rooted in basic mechanisms of cell adhesion, signaling, and differentiation that were present in the unicellular and colonial progenitors of metazoans. Reconstructing the evolution of metazoans from their single celled ancestors promises to illuminate one of the major transitions in evolutionary history, while also revealing fundamental mechanisms underlying metazoan cell biology and multicellularity. Although the first metazoans evolved over 600 million years ago, insights into their biology and origin may be gained through the comparison of metazoan genomes with those of their closest living relatives, the choanoflagellates [1–3]. Indeed, the genome of the first sequenced choanoflagellate, the single-celled species Monosiga brevicollis, provided evidence that diverse protein domains characteristic of metazoan signaling and adhesion proteins (for example, tyrosine kinase (TK), cadherin, and Hedgehog (Hh) domains) evolved before the divergence of choanoflagellates and metazoans [2]., The evolution of metazoans from their single-celled ancestors is hypothesized to have involved a transition through a colonial intermediate [4, 5], the Urblastea, which may have been composed of choanoflagellate-like cells [5] (Figure 1). The rosette-shaped colonies formed by the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta evoke the hypothesized Urblastea (Figure 1a, b). In addition to rosette colonies, the life history of S. rosetta includes diverse cell types and morphologies, including linear chains of cells ('chain colonies'), slow and fast swimmer cells, and thecate cells that attach to substrates through a secreted structure called a theca (Figure 1c) [6]. The diversity of these forms is comparable to the number of cell types observed in sponges and placozoans [7]. Therefore, sequencing the S. rosetta genome would provide an opportunity to investigate how genome evolution and cell differentiation in the ancestors of metazoans and multicellular choanoflagellates laid the foundations for metazoan cell biology and development. Furthermore, comparisons between the genomes of M. brevicollis and S. rosetta offer the opportunity to investigate the genetic bases of multicellularity in choanoflagellates. To these ends, we have sequenced and analyzed the S. rosetta genome and transcriptome during multiple key phases in the S. rosetta life history.

Taxonomic groupings are indicated above the phylogeny and the last common ancestors of each group are indicated as colored circles at nodes. The topology of the reference phylogeny was based on a consensus of results from [68–70]. Branches were collapsed at the base of Metazoa to reflect current uncertainty about the identity and branch order of the most basal metazoan phyla [69, 71–73]. The black, yellow, and green colored nodes are used in both Figures 1 and 2 to represent the Urmetazoan, Urchoanimal, and Uropisthokont, respectively. (b) The evolution of metazoans from their single-celled ancestors is hypothesized to have involved a transition through a simple colonial form, such as Haeckel's Blastea (left, from Figure 117 of [4]) or Nielsen's Choanoblastea (center, from [5]), that resembles the rosette colonies formed by S. rosetta (right). (c)
                        S. rosetta can transition through at least five morphologically and behaviorally differentiated cell types [6]. Solitary 'thecate' cells attached to a substrate (Th) can produce solitary swimming (Sw) cells or solitary fast swimming (FS) cells, either through cell division or theca abandonment. Solitary swimming cells can divide completely to produce solitary daughter cells or remain attached after undergoing incomplete cytokinesis to produce either chain colonies (CC), or rosette colonies (RC) in the presence of the bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis (asterisk) [6, 18, 64].

                    , The approximately 55 Mb S. rosetta genome was sequenced to 33× average coverage with a combination of Sanger and 454 technology and assembled into 154 scaffolds with an N50 average length of 1.52 Mb (Table S1 in Additional file 1). The genome assembly is largely complete, capturing approximately 96% of transcripts assembled de novo from RNA-seq data (Table S2 in Additional file 1). Predicted telomeres were found at both ends of 21 scaffolds and 24 additional scaffolds contain a single telomeric end, suggesting that S. rosetta has a minimum of 33 chromosomes (Table S3 in Additional file 1). A starting set of ab initio gene predictions generated by the Broad Institute annotation pipeline trained with ESTs (generated by Sanger chemistry) was refined using 21 Gb of transcriptome sequence (generated by Illumina chemistry) collected from diverse life history stages (Additional file 1, Figure S1). This gene catalog contains 11,629 genes, of which 98% are supported by transcriptome sequence data (Table S1 in Additional file 1). Aligning the protein sequences from this gene set to the M. brevicollis protein set revealed 4,994 orthologous pairs, yet the two species display relatively little gene synteny (Figure S14 in Additional file 1)., To reconstruct the gene contents of the progenitors of metazoans and choanoflagellates, we compared the genomes of S. rosetta and M. brevicollis [2] with the sequenced genomes of 32 representative metazoans and metazoan outgroups (Table S4 in Additional file 1). Evolutionary relationships among genes from different genomes were predicted using OrthoMCL2 [8] to identify 'ortholog clusters' (Additional files 2 and 4). The 11,629 genes of S. rosetta fall into 9,411 ortholog clusters (that is, some ortholog clusters contain multiple S. rosetta genes). The evolutionary history of each ortholog cluster was inferred by mapping its distribution onto a reference phylogeny (Figure 1a), allowing us to gain insight into the composition of ancestral genomes and patterns of gene gain and loss in the lineages leading to metazoans, choanoflagellates, and fungi (Figure 2; Additional file 5). Gene families and protein domains of particular interest were also curated manually (see, for example, Figures S7 to S9, S13 and Tables S6 and S8 in Additional file 1).

                        Gene gains and losses preceding the origin of metazoans. Reconstruction of ancestral gene content (predicted number of ortholog clusters indicated at each node) reveals that metazoans evolved as many as 1,235 ortholog clusters since their divergence from choanoflagellates and as many as 1,995 following their divergence with fungi, off-setting the loss of 20% of the Uropisthokont gene content. In contrast, current genome data suggest that the choanoflagellate and fungal lineages were dominated by gene loss. Choanoflagellates lost 47% of the Uropisthokont gene content and 37% of the gene content present in the Urchoanimal. Similarly, the fungal linage has lost 33% of the Uropisthokont gene content. Predicted ortholog cluster gain (+) and loss (-) is indicated, respectively, above and below each branch. Colored ovals represent predicted ancestral ortholog cluster content: red, S. rosetta; purple, M. brevicollis; black, Urmetazoan; white, Urfungus; blue, Urchoanoflagellate; yellow, Urchoanimal; green, Uropisthokont (Additional files 4 and 5).
                    , The genomes of the ancestors ('Ur-'; Figure 1a) of metazoans and opisthokonts (metazoans + choanoflagellates + fungi) were each predicted to have contained members of about 10,000 ortholog clusters. While nearly 20% (1,843) of the ortholog clusters from the Uropisthokont were lost along the lineage leading to the Urmetazoan, this lineage also experienced an equivalent amount of gene gain (Figure 2). In contrast, fungi and choanoflagellates apparently lost representation from 33% (3,372) and 47% (4,747) of the ancestral Uropisthokont ortholog clusters, respectively, but experienced only half as much gene gain. The S. rosetta genome also reveals that M. brevicollis has lost an additional 1,343 genes. Therefore, the S. rosetta genome sequence substantially clarifies the gene content of the Urchoanimal. Future sequencing of additional choanoflagellate genomes will further refine inferences about the gene content of the Urchoanimal, presumably by reducing the number of genes thought to be metazoan. Nonetheless, patterns of gene gain and loss based on currently sequenced genomes speak to the richness of the gene complement in the Uropisthokont [3] and emphasize the role that gene birth may have played in the evolution of biological novelties such as metazoan multicellularity., Therefore, we next characterized the 5,706 ortholog clusters that appear to have evolved along the stem lineage leading to metazoans (Additional file 3). These metazoan-specific ortholog clusters include homologs of genes that regulate cell adhesion, including δ-catenin and β-laminin, as well as genes involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and Wnt developmental signaling pathways. Many of the core components of the TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways (for example, TGF-β, TGF-β receptor, Smad, Wnt, Wntless, β-catenin, and TCF) were identified in every metazoan genome included in our analysis, underscoring their early evolution and fundamental importance to metazoan biology., Genes shared between choanoflagellates and metazoans were present in the progenitors of metazoans and may have contributed to the genomic foundations of the origin of metazoans. We find that the evolution of the monophyletic 'Choanimal' clade (which contains choanoflagellates and metazoans, and is not to be confused with the paraphyletic 'Choanozoa' (see Endnote a)), was marked by a disproportionate gain of genes with Gene Ontology terms [9] for metazoan cell adhesion and cell-junction organization (Table S5 in Additional file 1), including cadherins, PATJ (a component of adherens junctions) and KANK/vab-19 (an ankyrin repeat protein required for proper embryonic epidermal elongation and muscle attachment to the epidermis in Caenorhabditis elegans [10]). Ortholog clusters involved in metazoan neuropeptide signaling and glycosphingolipid metabolism also increased in abundance (Table S5 in Additional file 1). In addition, the S. rosetta genome, like that of M. brevicollis, contains a diverse and abundant repertoire of TKs (see Endnote b) [2, 11, 12] (Additional file 6). Ninety percent of the S. rosetta cytoplasmic TKs are conserved in the M. brevicollis genome, and S. rosetta has homologs of two adhesion-associated cytoplasmic TKs, FAK and Fer, that were apparently lost in M. brevicollis (Table S6 in Additional file 1). In contrast, only 21% of receptor TKs (RTKs) from S. rosetta and M. brevicollis form orthologous pairs. The added sequence diversity provided by the S. rosetta genome also revealed that choanoflagellates may have divergent homologs of metazoan Eph RTKs that were not originally detected in the M. brevicollis genome. Eph RTKs are key regulators of cell migration during development, regulating cellular organization through differential cell repulsion and adhesion [13]. Their discovery in S. rosetta lays the foundation for investigating core and ancestral functions of these important receptors., The S. rosetta genome now provides a platform for investigating the regulation of cell differentiation in choanoflagellates and the potential evolutionary connections between the cell biology of choanoflagellates and metazoans. Therefore, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of samples enriched in each of four different S. rosetta cell types: thecate cells, swimming cells (a mix of slow and fast swimmers), chain colonies, and rosette colonies (Figure 1c; Figure S1 in Additional file 1; Additional file 7). Using three independent analytical approaches we identified 480 S. rosetta genes that were consistently upregulated in colonies (chains and rosettes) compared to solitary cells (swimming and thecate) and 1,410 genes that were consistently upregulated in thecate cells relative to swimming solitary cells and colonies (Figures S2, S3 and S4 in Additional file 1; Additional files 8 to 13). For example, in colonies and thecate cells distinct subsets of TKs, cadherins (notable for their roles in metazoan cell signaling and adhesion) and Hh-domain containing proteins (see Endnote c) were significantly upregulated (Figures S5, S6, and S12 in Additional file 1), although their functions in these contexts are unknown., Perhaps most illuminating was the observation that all four members of the S. rosetta septin gene family were significantly upregulated in colonies (Figure 3a). Septins, conserved GTPases that regulate cytokinesis in fungi and metazoans, were first identified in yeast through a screen for cytokinesis defects; septin mutants frequently failed to undergo proper cytokinesis and therefore exhibited multicellular phenotypes [14]. Metazoan septins also stabilize intercellular bridges such as midbodies and ring canals [15, 16]. During metazoan cytokinesis and in intercellular bridges, a set of specific septin monomers polymerize to form cytoskeletal filaments [17]. The four S. rosetta septins have conserved amino acid residues on predicted interacting surfaces, suggesting they may also form filaments (Figure 3b; Figures S7 and S8 in Additional file 1). Interestingly, S. rosetta homologs of other midbody-associated proteins and septin regulators, including Aurora kinase, the scaffolding protein Anillin, and Polo kinase, are also significantly upregulated in colonies (Figure 3a). The coordinated upregulation of septins and septin regulators is notable because colony development in S. rosetta occurs by incomplete cytokinesis, such that neighboring cells remain physically linked by intercellular bridges (Figure 3c) [6, 18].

                        Septins are upregulated in colonial cells.

                    , The genes that regulated cell differentiation in the progenitors of metazoans may have provided the foundations for the spatiotemporal regulation of cell differentiation that underpins metazoan development. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary history of genes differentially expressed in different S. rosetta cell types may suggest which cell types are most conducive to the study of metazoan origins. Of the 11,628 genes in the S. rosetta genome, at least 57% were present in the Uropisthokont, 5% arose on the Urchoanimal stem, 6% are choanoflagellate-specific, and 31% are apparently unique to S. rosetta (Figure 4a; Table S7 in Additional file 1). The evolutionary histories of genes upregulated in specific cell types deviated significantly from this distribution. For example, thecate cells disproportionately upregulated genes that evolved within choanoflagellates, after their divergence from the metazoan stem lineage (Figure 4b; Table S7 in Additional file 1). Therefore, the unusual morphology and transcriptional profile of thecate cells suggest that important aspects of their biology may be unique to choanoflagellates. Colony development, in contrast, has potential relevance for understanding the regulation of early metazoan multicellularity. Colonies develop from a subset of solitary swimming cells [6], so the most likely regulators of colony development are the 352 genes that are specifically upregulated in both solitary swimming cells and in colonies (Figure 4c; Table S7 in Additional file 1). Interestingly, this set is highly enriched in genes that are exclusively shared with metazoans and that presumably evolved along the Urchoanimal stem lineage. Genes involved in the maintenance of mature colonies, as opposed to those involved in regulating early colony development, would be expected to be specifically upregulated in colonies (Figure 4d; Table S7 in Additional file 1), but not in the single cells from which they develop (Figure 4e; Table S7 in Additional file 1). This set was enriched in genes unique to S. rosetta. Taken together, these data led us to hypothesize that the initiation of S. rosetta colony development draws upon genes shared with metazoans, while later stages of colony maturation are regulated by genes that are unique to S. rosetta.

(a) The majority (57%) of S. rosetta genes are ancient and evolved prior to the divergence of choanoflagellates, metazoans and fungi. An additional 5% of S. rosetta genes emerged along the stem lineage leading to S. rosetta and metazoans and 6% evolved along the choanoflagellate stem lineage.

                    , Although the progenitors of metazoans expired over 600 million years ago [19, 20], genome comparisons between metazoans and their closest relatives, the choanoflagellates, can offer detailed insights into the evolutionary foundations of metazoan genomes and gene families [20]. The S. rosetta genome refines the catalog of metazoan-specific genes and highlights the potential relevance of key gene families to the evolution of defining features of metazoan biology. Genes with a variety of evolutionary histories - including highly conserved genes with functions that are integral to eukaryotic cell biology, genes that evolved before the choanimals and that were subsequently co-opted to new metazoan-specific functions, and new genes whose evolution may have served as key innovations - shaped the evolution of metazoans from their protistan ancestors [21, 22]. With this more complete gene catalog, it is now possible to reconstruct the ancestry of metazoan gene families in unprecedented detail (for example, Figures S6 and S9 in Additional file 1, and [23, 24]). The M. brevicollis genome sequence previously revealed that diverse protein domains in metazoan signaling and adhesion genes, including cadherin, Hh, and TK, evolved before the origin of metazoan multicellularity [2]. The S. rosetta genome now reveals that the Urchoanimal genome contained representatives of at least eight metazoan TK gene families (Table S6 in Additional file 1), including the developmentally important Eph RTKs, and raises questions about their ancestral functions in the Urchoanimal [25, 26]., In addition to expanding gene family representation, the S. rosetta genome also sheds light on the pathways in which these genes are traditionally thought to operate. For example, while some components of the TK and Hh developmental signaling pathways are conserved in choanoflagellates (for example, Src, Eph RTK, and Patched), others are not. Therefore, the evolution of these pathways along the metazoan stem lineage likely involved an as-yet undefined combination of protein domain shuffling, gene cooption, and evolution of new protein-protein interactions [2, 27] that promises to be further elucidated by the continued study of diverse early-branching metazoans, choanoflagellates and other metazoan outgroups [24, 28]. In contrast, components of the Wnt pathway have not been identified in any sequenced non-metazoan genome, including those of S. rosetta and M. brevicollis, suggesting that the pathway did not evolve until after the divergence of metazoans and choanoflagellates [29–31]. A sponge classical cadherin has proven capable of binding in vitro [23] to its cognate β-catenin, a Wnt pathway effector, suggesting that at least a portion of the critical interactions in the Wnt pathway evolved before the Cambrian radiation. Given the ubiquity of Wnt pathway components in metazoans and their essential roles in regulating embryonic patterning in diverse animals, it is therefore possible that the evolution of the Wnt pathway was critical to the early evolution of metazoans., Finally, the S. rosetta genome offers the opportunity to investigate whether choanoflagellate colony formation and metazoan development are regulated by conserved mechanisms. The upregulation of conserved genes and gene families in colonies, such as septins, cadherins, and Hh-related proteins, is intriguing and warrants further investigation to fully understand their current and ancestral functions. Taken together, the S. rosetta genome and transcriptome suggest that the genome of the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans contained genes and domains that orchestrate development in modern animals but underwent important changes in gene content and regulation en route to the evolution of the first metazoan. Further refinement of ancestral genomes through comparative genomics with additional choanoflagellate genomes and functional efforts in choanoflagellates and sponges promises to reveal the minimal set of genes required for metazoan development and multicellularity."

Although ectopic affinity-tethering of specific loci can be used to relocate chromosomes to the nuclear periphery, endogenous nuclear envelope proteins that control such a mechanism in mammalian cells have yet to be widely identified., To search for such proteins, 23 nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins were screened for their ability to promote peripheral localization of human chromosomes in HT1080 fibroblasts. Five of these proteins had strong effects on chromosome 5, but individual proteins affected different subsets of chromosomes. The repositioning effects were reversible and the proteins with effects all exhibited highly tissue-restricted patterns of expression. Depletion of two nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins that were preferentially expressed in liver each reduced the normal peripheral positioning of chromosome 5 in liver cells., The discovery of nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins that can modulate chromosome position and have restricted patterns of expression may enable dissection of the functional relevance of tissue-specific patterns of radial chromosome positioning.","","It is well established that specific chromosomes, chromosome regions, and/or chromatin domains have preferred positions in the nucleus. For example, gene-poor chromosomes/regions tend to be at the nuclear periphery while gene-rich regions locate to the interior [1–5]. This radial organization can be modulated by the physiological and pathological state of the cell [6–8]. Genome organization can also be tissue specific [9–11]. For example, mouse chromosome 5 tends to be in the nuclear interior in liver but at the periphery in lung [12]. More dramatically, the radial organization of chromatin completely inverts in the nuclei of rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals [13]. In addition to visual methods, molecular approaches also reveal changes in associations of the mammalian genome with the nuclear lamins upon differentiation [14]., One might easily postulate that peripheral localization would depend on connections to the nuclear envelope (NE). Indeed, many NE proteins have chromatin binding activities important for reforming the NE at the end of mitosis [15, 16] and a high-affinity interaction established at this time can direct interphase chromosome positioning [17–19]. However, most NE-chromatin interactions described involve widely expressed proteins (reviewed in [20]) mediating interactions with heterochromatin [21–25]. Such interactions provide a mechanism to maintain inactive chromatin at the periphery that could explain the partial relationship between chromosome positioning and gene density. However, they do not explain how in some tissues particular chromosomes reposition to the nuclear periphery. Some work has been done indicating components that may be involved from the chromatin side, but the only proteins implicated from the NE thus far are lamins. However, though lamin B1 contributes to retention of specific chromosomes at the nuclear periphery, its ubiquitous presence is inconsistent with it directing tissue-specific chromosome positioning without additional factors [26, 27]. That lamins support this process is further indicated by mutant forms of lamin A resulting in altered chromosome positioning in human nuclei [8, 28]., To identify other NE factors, 22 novel NE transmembrane proteins (NETs) [29] and emerin were screened for their ability to contribute to chromosome positioning patterns in human cells. Five NETs (NET5, NET29, NET39, NET45 and NET47) promoted repositioning of chromosome 5 to the periphery, but only two of these (NET29 and NET39) did so for chromosome 13. These NETs exhibited restricted tissue expression and several were preferentially expressed in liver with, for example, NET45 and NET47 expressed roughly 20-fold higher in liver than in kidney. Correspondingly, chromosome 5 was more peripheral in the nuclei of human liver than in kidney. Chromosome repositioning effects of NETs were reversible; most notably, depletion of the two most liver-specific NETs in liver cells reduced the normal peripheral positioning of chromosome 5. Thus, we postulate that these NETs may play a role in generating the more particular patterns of chromosome organization observed in certain tissues., We have identified nuclear membrane proteins that have extremely restricted patterns of expression in tissues and can promote particular patterns of spatial genome organization. Most NE-chromatin interactions described previously involved widely expressed proteins [20] mediating interactions with general heterochromatin [21–25, 43]. Such interactions provide a mechanism for maintaining silent chromatin at the periphery that could help explain the partial relationship between chromosome positioning and gene density and indeed manipulating histone methylation can also affect heterochromatin positioning at the NE [44]. The release of chromosome 18 from the periphery due to lamin B1 defects [26] likely reflects such a mechanism because both lamin B1 and the core histones it binds [45–47] are ubiquitously expressed. The same should apply for the lamin A effects on chromosome position; however, lamin A mutations associated with disease affected gene and chromosome positioning in a more tissue-specific manner [28, 48, 49]. For example, lamin A mutations blocked release of a tissue-specific promoter from the periphery in the tissue matched to the promoter, but did not affect the peripheral localization in other tissues [48]. This suggests that lamin A is not the only protein involved in the initial tethering. Instead, we propose that lamins might reinforce a chromosome arrangement initially established by a tissue-restricted NET or be required for NE targeting of the NET, consistent with recent studies on lamin-associated domain organization by lamin B1 in conjunction with LAP2ß and HDAC3 [27] and generalized heterochromatin association with the periphery mediated by lamins in conjunction with the lamin B receptor (LBR) [43]., We postulate that the tissue-restricted NETs we have found function in similar complexes with lamins and chromatin proteins. There has been far more research to identify proteins on chromatin involved in tissue-specific patterns of genome organization compared to what has been done to identify the NE component. For example, in Caenorhabditis. elegans, release from the periphery of a muscle-specific promoter could be effected by the muscle-specific transcriptional regulator HLH-1 [10]. This argues that tissue-specific genes on chromosomes and transcriptional complexes sitting on them may be the mechanism by which specificity of chromosome positioning is conferred on the chromosome side because these tissue-specific genes would be unevenly distributed on the chromosomes. Different gene regulatory complexes that interact with different NETs could in theory work together to achieve a threshold affinity for chromosome tethering. That both NET29 and NET39 knockdown reduced the peripheral incidence of chromosome 13 in HT1080 cells and both liver-preferential NET47 and NET45 knockdown in the liver HepG2 cells reduced the peripheral incidence of chromosome 5 is consistent with this idea. However, much work still needs to be done to identify the specific binding partners on chromatin, to investigate the functions of these NETs in both matched and unmatched tissues, and test them in different combinations. Further, although the loss of chromosome repositioning function with the soluble fragments is consistent with the NETs being the physical tether at the NE, we cannot exclude the possibility that the NETs have a less direct function in modifying a different tether protein or chromatin component. Furthermore, although NET5, NET29, NET39 and NET47 were all resistant to a pre-fixation detergent extraction characteristic of lamina-associated NETs and characterized at the inner nuclear membrane by super resolution microscopy and in some cases immuno-electron microscopy [29–31], the fact that with overexpression much accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum raises the possibility that some effects could be mediated indirectly from the cytoplasm., The partial reduction in peripheral positioning observed for chromosome 13 in cells expressing NET47 could imply an indirect effect for these NETs in modifying a signaling pathway that can go in either direction, that is, movement towards the periphery or movement away from the periphery. However, it is also perfectly consistent with a model where different NETs recruiting partially overlapping and partially distinct sets of chromosomes to the periphery could indirectly cause the release of a particular chromosome from the periphery by increasing the peripheral tethering of a different chromosome., Of the NETs that had effects in this screen, NET29, NET39, NET45 and NET47 are uncharacterized for any chromatin-related functions and there are no shared sequence characteristics among them. Only NET5 (also known as Tmem201 and Samp1) has been experimentally indicated to be able to bind to DNA or chromatin [50, 51]. NET47 (also known as TM7SF2 and delta(14)-sterol reductase), which has a separate enzymatic function [52–54], may also be able to bind chromatin because it shares considerable sequence similarity with LBR [52, 55] that binds heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) [56]. Part of this HP1 binding site has been mapped close to the first transmembrane domain of LBR [57], a region that has high homology with NET47. Additionally, LBR has also been shown to be involved in spatial olfactory receptor gene organization [58]. Interestingly, both NET39 and NET47 have been implicated in tissue-specific processes, with NET39 playing a role in myogenesis [59, 60] and NET47 knockout mice exhibiting a reduction in gene expression from a number of liver-specific genes [61]., Although there is still much work to do in testing whether these tissue-restricted NETs are tissue-specific in their functions and identifying the interaction partners/sites on chromosomes, the effects of NET47 on liver-specific gene expression [61] suggests that future work with these NETs will also answer questions on the functional consequences of particular patterns of spatial genome organization. Many aspects of the effects of spatial genome organization on gene expression remain contentious. For example, three studies tethering a lacO array to the NE yielded three different effects on gene expression [17–19]. Future studies manipulating tissue-restricted NETs in matched tissue systems may be the key to clearly answering many questions about the functional consequences of spatial genome organization., Certain chromosomes exhibit tissue-specific patterns of radial positioning in nuclei and several studies have demonstrated that chromosome tethering to the nuclear envelope can be achieved through an affinity mechanism. However, the endogenous proteins responsible for establishing a particular pattern of radial chromosome positioning have remained elusive. Here we identify several tissue-restricted nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins that can alter the radial position of chromosomes in the nucleus. Exogenous expression of each of these proteins in a general fibroblast cell line can recruit particular sets of chromosomes to the nuclear periphery and the peripheral distribution of certain chromosomes in differentiated cells can be reduced by depletion of these proteins. We predict that these newly discovered tissue-restricted NETs will likely play a pivotal role in dissecting the functional relevance of tissue-specific patterns of radial chromosome positioning in development."

However, studies in the past few decades have only uncovered a small fraction of the vast landscape of the protein-RNA interactome in any organism, and even less is known about the dynamics of protein-RNA interactions under changing developmental and environmental conditions., Here, we describe the gPAR-CLIP (global photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunopurification) approach for capturing regions of the untranslated, polyadenylated transcriptome bound by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in budding yeast. We report over 13,000 RBP crosslinking sites in untranslated regions (UTRs) covering 72% of protein-coding transcripts encoded in the genome, confirming 3' UTRs as major sites for RBP interaction. Comparative genomic analyses reveal that RBP crosslinking sites are highly conserved, and RNA folding predictions indicate that secondary structural elements are constrained by protein binding and may serve as generalizable modes of RNA recognition. Finally, 38% of 3' UTR crosslinking sites show changes in RBP occupancy upon glucose or nitrogen deprivation, with major impacts on metabolic pathways as well as mitochondrial and ribosomal gene expression., Our study offers an unprecedented view of the pervasiveness and dynamics of protein-RNA interactions in vivo.","","A diverse and expanding repertoire of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) ensures faithful expression and function of substrate mRNAs [1–3]. Many RNAs are organized by RBPs and other protein co-factors into higher-order ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assemblies that fulfill critical functions in storage, transport, inheritance, and degradation of RNA [4, 5]. For example, over 70% of mRNAs in Drosophila embryos are localized to distinct organelles, compartments, and membrane interfaces, providing a means for directing local translation and regulating cellular architectures and functions [6]. RNA and RBPs can also reversibly aggregate into granules to allow RNA storage and decay in response to stimuli [7, 8]. These and many other processes are driven by large, complex networks of protein-RNA interactions that provide specificity in gene regulation and fidelity in RNP assembly. Despite important insights regarding the necessity of RNA regulation for cellular functions, the RBP-RNA interactome and its response to changing cellular conditions have yet to be fully elucidated., Studies of RBP-RNA interactions have historically relied on the identification of target transcripts bound by individual RBPs. In vitro selection of RNA sequences that bind RBPs with high affinity (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment, SELEX) can identify primary sequence recognition elements. For example, Nova proteins, which regulate mRNA splicing in neurons, recognize the RNA consensus sequence YCAY [9], and Y box-binding protein-1, a member of the cold shock/Y box domain protein family, recognizes a CAYC RNA motif [10]. Yet these and other primary sequence elements identified in vitro are generally short and degenerate and appear too frequently in the transcriptome to be useful for in silico target identification. Microarray profiling of transcripts that co-purify with interacting proteins (RIP-Chip) has been widely used to detect transcripts stably associated with RBPs, such as mRNAs bound by translational components HuB, eIF-4E, and PABP in P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells [11]. Similarly, RIP-Chip experiments have identified mRNAs associated with 40 yeast RBPs and uncovered a set of potential RBP recognition motifs [12, 13], some of which were validated in vitro using SELEX [14]. Although capable of identifying mRNA targets for select RBPs, RIP-Chip is prone to artifacts, including RBP-RNA dissociation and re-association after cell lysis [15], isolation of non-specific RNAs, and indirect binding through other co-purified RBPs [16]. In addition, RIP-Chip cannot detect transient interactions or resolve the exact RBP binding sites on identified transcripts., To identify transcriptome-wide footprints of RBPs in vivo, UV crosslinking has been coupled with immunopurification of RBPs (CLIP) [17, 18]. CLIP takes advantage of the photoreactivity of RNA bases, most often pyrimidines, with interacting amino acid side chains upon 254 nm UV irradiation [19]. The formation of covalent linkages allows stringent purification of RBP-RNA complexes and subsequent identification of crosslinked RNA fragments via cDNA sequencing. Recently, a modified CLIP technique, PAR-CLIP (photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP), has been introduced in which photoactivatable-ribonucleoside analogs are incorporated into the transcriptome in live cells to enable efficient crosslinking using 365 nm UV irradiation [20]. Recent studies employing CLIP in mouse brain [21] and Caenorhabditis elegans [22] and PAR-CLIP in human embryonic kidney cells [20] have successfully decoded in vivo microRNA-mRNA interactions by identifying RNAs bound to Argonaute, a main component of the microRNA-induced silencing complex. PAR-CLIP has also been implemented to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of human antigen R (HuR) protein, which stabilizes gene expression by binding to AU-rich elements [23, 24], and to identify the transcriptome-wide distribution of non-poly(A) termination factors in yeast [25]. In addition to enabling efficient crosslinking, PAR-CLIP generates frequent and non-random nucleotide substitutions at crosslinking sites to reveal specific RBP-RNA contact sites with nucleotide resolution., Until recently, CLIP and PAR-CLIP have been limited to investigation of individual RBPs. Two recent studies introduced the use of photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced UV crosslinking with oligo(dT) pull-down of mRNAs followed by tandem mass spectrometry to globally identify mRNA-binding proteins in human cell lines [26, 27]. In addition to identifying known RBPs, these studies identified 315 [26] and 245 [27] novel RBPs that lack canonical RNA-binding domains and functional annotation as RNA-binding proteins. Castello et al. [26] found that RBP amino acid sequences are more disordered than those of non-RBPs and identified potential new classes of RNA-binding domains. Baltz et al. [27] additionally captured and sequenced protein-bound mRNAs, providing a transcriptome-wide map of potential cis-regulatory elements., Despite recent advances towards understanding global RBP-RNA interactions, the dynamic nature of these associations in vivo and the general principles driving these associations remain unexplored. Here, we adapt the PAR-CLIP technique to map all RBP binding sites across the yeast non-translating mRNAs in different environmental conditions, a method we call global PAR-CLIP (gPAR-CLIP). The comprehensive identification of RBP-RNA crosslinked sites visualized by gPAR-CLIP allows us to derive general properties of RBP-RNA interactions in vivo. Additionally, we compared RBP-RNA crosslinked sites in rapidly proliferating versus stress-treated cells and observed large-scale changes in RBP-RNA interactions, providing a starting point for dissecting the network of post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms underlying stress response., RNP complexes exhibit dynamic properties that are sensitive to environmental conditions. For example, granules containing stalled translation pre-initiation complexes are formed under stress but rapidly dissociate when the cell returns to favorable conditions [51]. Despite insight into how particular RNP complexes are affected by stress, global effects of stress on all RBP-RNA interactions have until now remained unexplored. We detect reproducible changes in occupancy for 38% of 3' UTR crosslinking sites on non-translating mRNAs under glucose or nitrogen starvation conditions: loss of RBP occupancy at RBP crosslinking sites was a phenomenon common to both glucose and nitrogen stress conditions, while more distinct sets of crosslinking sites increased RBP occupancy (Figure 5c)., In our current work, we limited our gPAR-CLIP analyses to protein-RNA interactions residing in non-translated RNPs (Figure 1a; Materials and methods), which mediate important functions for mRNA translation, localization, and degradation [52]. Because we have no information on the identities of the RBPs or their distribution in the sucrose gradient, we cannot distinguish whether the changes in RBP coverage represent changes in RBP binding and/or distribution. This is particularly relevant in glucose or nitrogen starvation, as many RBPs redistribute under these conditions [53]. Future comparative gPAR-CLIP analyses on both non-translating RNP and translating RNPs in stress conditions will distinguish changes in RBP binding versus changes in RBP localization., RNAs are capable of forming complex two- and three-dimensional structures, and some RBPs are known to recognize such structural motifs. For example, She2p mediates the localization of several bud-localized transcripts during cell division by recognizing and binding to specific stem-loop structures in mRNAs [40, 41]. Examination of the structural properties of our global RBP crosslinking sites revealed a preference for single-stranded regions, which agrees with previous reports of crosslinking sites of the RNA-binding protein FUS occurring at single-stranded regions directly adjacent to the FUS RNA recognition motif [54]. Unpaired loop and bulge regions can be unstructured or form tertiary structural modules, both of which can be readily recognized by RBPs. In contrast, double-stranded RNAs, in general, do not provide good platforms for RBP binding: structured RNA regions captured by gPAR-CLIP generally had low CLS values (Figure 4), likely resulting from crosslinking and/or RNase T1 cleavage inefficiency. In structured regions, 4-thiouridines are more likely to be locked in U:A or U:G pairing, preventing crosslinking to proteins. In addition, structured regions are less accessible to RNase attack during sequencing fragment preparation, resulting in under-representation in gPAR-CLIP libraries. Nevertheless, despite their low crosslinking efficiencies, Ts in double-stranded, paired RNA regions show extremely high conservation compared to Ts with no crosslinking evidence. These data indicate that RNAs with high secondary structure are evolutionarily conserved and can serve as functional, secondary structure motifs recognized by select RBPs., RBP binding sites functioning as cis-regulatory elements are expected to be under purifying selection. We identified a substantial fraction (35%) of conserved elements in UTRs overlapping RBP crosslinking sites. This represents an underestimation because RBPs and RNAs that are not expressed under our experimental conditions or that fail to crosslink will not be captured. Although crosslinking sites in general are more highly conserved than non-crosslinking sites in UTRs, many sites are not well conserved and might represent species-specific cis-regulatory elements that allow adaptation to different environments and stressors., A preference of RBP binding to 3' UTRs observed in this study and others [13, 14] is consistent with the function and evolution of 3' UTRs as major sites for post-transcriptional regulation. Unlike protein-coding regions, 3' UTRs do not directly engage ribosomes during translation and therefore provide accessible platforms for RBP binding and RNP assembly. One important aspect of gene regulation is combinatorial control, which allows a single gene to be controlled by more than one regulator. In our study, 23% of all nucleotides in annotated 3' UTRs were located within RPB crosslinking sites, corresponding to an average of 1 crosslinking site, on average 23 nucleotides long, in every 100 nucleotides. For a median-sized yeast 3' UTR that is 166 nucleotides long [38], there are, on average, 2 RBP crosslinking sites, suggesting that most yeast genes are subject to combinatorial post-transcriptional regulation. Since S. cerevisiae lacks post-transcriptional regulation by the highly conserved and pervasive microRNA regulatory pathway, combinatorial regulation by RBPs may play a more prominent role than in organisms with small RNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation., Unlike focused interrogation of individual RBPs, gPAR-CLIP does not directly identify the RBP that recognizes each crosslinking site. To enable identification of primary sequence motifs recognized by individual RBPs, we searched gPAR-CLIP crosslinking sites located on target mRNAs identified in vitro by RIP-Chip for 29 RBPs [12, 13] and identified 39 motifs for 15 RBPs (Additional file 20; Materials and methods). Notably, 35 of the sequence motifs derived by gPAR-CLIP differed significantly from previous motif predictions, which were based on scanning whole transcript sequences for enriched k-mers. This discrepancy between primary sequence motifs identified by our gPAR-CLIP data and previous predictions illustrates the potential utility of deriving motifs based on direct in vivo evidence of RBP-RNA interactions, which narrows the search space to enhance the signal of bona fide primary sequence recognition elements., Our study provides a comprehensive map of RBP crosslinking sites across the budding yeast non-translating mRNA transcriptome and for the first time describes the dynamics of mRNA-RBP binding under normal and nutrient-limited growth conditions. Delineating in vivo sites of RBP binding will aid in directing future studies for identification of sites responsive to environmental or genetic perturbations, refinement of primary sequence and secondary structural elements recognized by specific RBPs, and elucidation of the complex network of regulatory processes that contribute to regulation of expression of each individual mRNA. gPAR-CLIP is readily applicable to other organisms for profiling global RNA-protein interactions underlying post-transcriptional regulation and the effects of environmental perturbations upon these interactions."

SOAPfuse applies an improved partial exhaustion algorithm to construct a library of fusion junction sequences, which can be used to efficiently identify fusion events, and employs a series of filters to nominate high-confidence fusion transcripts. Compared with other released tools, SOAPfuse achieves higher detection efficiency and consumed less computing resources. We applied SOAPfuse to RNA-Seq data from two bladder cancer cell lines, and confirmed 15 fusion transcripts, including several novel events common to both cell lines. SOAPfuse is available at http://​soap.​genomics.​org.​cn/​soapfuse.​html., Gene fusions, arising from the juxtaposition of two distinct regions in chromosomes, play important roles in carcinogenesis and can serve as valuable diagnostic and therapeutic targets in cancer. Aberrant gene fusions have been widely described in malignant hematological disorders and sarcomas [1–3], with the recurrent BCR-ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia as the classic example [4]. In contrast, the biological and clinical impact of gene fusions in more common solid tumor types has been less appreciated [2]. However, recent discoveries of recurrent gene fusions, such as TMPRSS2-ERG in a majority of prostate cancers [5, 6], EML4-ALK in non-small-cell lung cancer [7] and VTI1A-TCF7L2 in colorectal cancer [8], point to their functionally important role in solid tumors. These fusion events were not detected until recently due to technical and analytic problems encountered in the identification of balanced chromosomal aberrations in complex karyotypic profiles of solid tumors., Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform provides a revolutionary, new tool for precise measurement of levels of transcript abundance and structure in a large variety of species [9–16]. In addition, RNA-Seq has been proven to be a sensitive and efficient approach to gene fusion discovery in many types of cancers [17–20]. Compared with whole genome sequencing, which is also able to detect gene-fusion-creating rearrangements, RNA-Seq identifies fusion events that generate aberrant transcripts that are more likely to be functional or causal in biological or disease settings., Recently, several computational methods, including FusionSeq [21], deFuse [22], TopHat-Fusion [23], FusionHunter [24], SnowShoes-FTD [25], chimerascan [26] and FusionMap [27], have been developed to identify fusion transcript candidates by analyzing RNA-Seq data. Although these methods were capable of detecting genuine fusion transcripts, many challenges and limitations remain. For example, to determine the junction sites in a given fusion transcript, FusionSeq selected all exons that were potentially involved in the junction from both of the gene pairs, and then covered the exons with a set of 'tiles' that were spaced one nucleotide apart [21]. A fusion junction library was constructed by creating all pairwise junctions between these tiles, and the junctions were identified by mapping the RNA-Seq reads to the junction library. This module makes FusionSeq time consuming, especially for genes with more and larger exons. In addition, FusionHunter identified only fusion transcripts with junction sites at the exon edge (splicing junction), but could not detect a fusion transcript with junction sites in the middle of an exon [24]. Many homologous genes and repetitive sequences often masquerade as fusion events due to ambiguous alignments of short NGS sequencing reads. The lack of effective filtering mechanisms promoted frequent detection of spurious fusion transcripts. Furthermore, several software consumed large amounts of computational resources (CPU time and memory usage), which was a serious problem when analyzing hundreds of samples in parallel., To address the limitations above, we present a new algorithm, SOAPfuse, which detects fusion transcripts in cancer from paired-end RNA-Seq data. SOAPfuse combines alignment of RNA-Seq paired-end reads against the human genome reference sequence and annotated genes, with detection of candidate fusion events. It seeks two types of reads supporting a fusion event (Figure 1a): discordant mapping paired-end reads (span-read) that connect the candidate fusion gene pairs; and junction reads (junc-read) that confirm the exact junction sites. SOAPfuse applies an improved partial exhaustion algorithm to efficiently construct a putative junction library and also adopts a series of filters and quality control measures to discriminate likely genuine fusions from sequencing and alignment artifacts (Figure 1b; see Materials and methods). The program reports a high-confidence list of fusion transcripts with the precise locations of junction sites at single nucleotide resolution. Furthermore, SOAPfuse supplies the predicted junction sequences of fusion transcripts, which are helpful for the design of bilateral primers in preparation for RT-PCR validation. Moreover, SOAPfuse creates schematic diagrams that can display the alignment of supporting reads (span-reads and junc-reads) on junction sequences and expression levels of exons from each gene pair. Figures are created in lossless image format (SVG, scalable vector graphics) and, with detailed information on fusion events, will facilitate comprehensive characterization of fusion transcripts at single base resolution and will greatly aid manual selection of the fusion events of interest for further research. SOAPfuse can distinguish specific features of RNA-Seq data, such as insert size and read length, so it still works well even when a single sample includes different types of paired-end RNA-Seq data.

                    , We have developed a new method called SOAPfuse to aid in fusion transcript discovery from paired-end RNA-Seq data. Comparing SOAPfuse with other tools on two previously published datasets, one simulated dataset and two bladder cancer cell line datasets, we authenticated superior performance and high sensitivity of SOAPfuse. By evaluating the program on a simulated dataset, SOAPfuse showed a low FP rate (5%) at different expression levels of fusion transcripts and it also achieved a low FN rate of 5% when the expression levels of fusion transcripts were greater than 30-fold. Using the bladder cancer cell line datasets, we demonstrated with RT-PCR-validated fusions that SOAPfuse has substantially high accuracy (15 of 16, 94%) and we also identified several novel fusion transcripts that may be derived from chromosomal rearrangements., In the simulated dataset, SOAPfuse missed three fusion transcripts. The program had some difficulties detecting fusion transcripts from gene pairs having highly similar sequences, and fusion transcripts involving short transcripts of long genes. However, preliminary solutions have been applied to remedy these shortcomings successfully (Additional file 3), and will be included in future versions of SOAPfuse. After analyzing the characteristics of the fusion events, we found that several novel fusion transcripts detected in the bladder cancer cell lines were more likely to be derived from chromosomal rearrangements of the DNA. Whole genome sequencing will be helpful for determining whether the fusion transcripts are from genomic DNA variations and if the breakpoints can be detected. We have started to develop a new algorithm to detect chromosomal rearrangements that can generate predicted fusion transcripts from whole genome sequencing data based on the results from SOAPfuse. It will be complementary to SOAPfuse for performing genome analysis of fusions with tools like CREST [34]. We will continuously refine SOAPfuse and update it on our official website., Here we present an optimized publicly available methodology for identifying novel fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. Our results suggest that SOAPfuse achieves better performance than other published tools and it produces a highly accurate list of fusion events in a time-efficient manner. Furthermore, it provides predicted junction sequences and schematic diagrams of fusion events, which are helpful to analyze detected fusions. Overall, SOAPfuse is a useful method that will enable other research groups to make discoveries from their own RNA-Seq data collections."

Here we present an analysis of a whole genome assembly of Acanthamoeba castellanii (Ac) the first representative from a solitary free-living amoebozoan., 
                  Ac encodes 15,455 compact intron-rich genes, a significant number of which are predicted to have arisen through inter-kingdom lateral gene transfer (LGT). A majority of the LGT candidates have undergone a substantial degree of intronization and Ac appears to have incorporated them into established transcriptional programs. Ac manifests a complex signaling and cell communication repertoire, including a complete tyrosine kinase signaling toolkit and a comparable diversity of predicted extracellular receptors to that found in the facultatively multicellular dictyostelids. An important environmental host of a diverse range of bacteria and viruses, Ac utilizes a diverse repertoire of predicted pattern recognition receptors, many with predicted orthologous functions in the innate immune systems of higher organisms., Our analysis highlights the important role of LGT in the biology of Ac and in the diversification of microbial eukaryotes. The early evolution of a key signaling facility implicated in the evolution of metazoan multicellularity strongly argues for its emergence early in the Unikont lineage. Overall, the availability of an Ac genome should aid in deciphering the biology of the Amoebozoa and facilitate functional genomic studies in this important model organism and environmental host.","","
                Acanthamoeba castellanii (Ac) is one of the predominant soil organisms in terms of population size and distribution, where it acts both as a predator and an environmental reservoir for a number of bacterial, fungal and viral species [1]. Selective grazing by Ac in the rhizosphere alters microbial community structure and is an important contributor to the development of root architecture and nutrient uptake by plants [2]. Ac can also be isolated from almost any body of water and manifests in a wide variety of man-made water systems, including potable water sources, swimming pools, hot tubs, showers and hospital air conditioning units [3, 4]. Acanthamoebae are frequently associated with a diverse range of bacterial symbionts [5, 6]. A subset of the microbes that serve as prey for Ac have evolved virulence stratagems to use Ac as both a replicative niche and as a vector for dispersal and are important human intracellular pathogens [7, 8]. These pathogens utilize analogous strategies to infect and persist within mammalian macrophages, illustrating the role of environmental hosts such as Ac in the evolution and maintenance of virulence [9, 10]. Commonalities at the level of host response between amoebae and macrophages to such pathogens have led to the use of both Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd) and Ac as model systems to study pathogenesis [11, 12]., Published Amoebozoa genomes from both the obligate parasite Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) and the facultatively multicellular Dd have both highlighted unexpected complexities at the level of cell motility and signaling [13, 14]. As the only solitary free-living representative, the genome of Ac establishes a unique reference point for comparisons for the interpretation of other amoebozoan genomes. Experimentally, Ac has been a more thoroughly studied organism than most other free living amoebae, acting as a model organism for studies on the cytoskeleton, cell movement, and aspects of gene regulation, with a large body of literature supporting its molecular interactions [15–18]., Comparative genomics of the Amoebozoa has until now been restricted to comparisons between the multicellular dictyostelids and the obligate parasite Eh [80, 81]. Ac, while sharing many of their features, enriches the repertoire of amoebozoan genomes in a number of important areas, including signaling and pattern recognition. LGT has significantly contributed to both the genome and transcriptome of Ac whose accessory genome shares unexpected similarities with a phylogenetically distant amoeba. The presence of prokaryotic TEs in Ac illustrates its role in the evolution of some of the earth's most unusual organisms [82] as well a number of important human pathogens [7, 8][83]., 
                Ac has adopted bacterial-like adhesion proteins to facilitate adherence to biofilms and H-NOX based nitric oxide signaling which likely aids in their dispersal [84]. Overall the adaptive value conferred by LGT is highlighted by the expression of the large majority in Ac across multiple conditions, which points to their adoption into novel transcriptional networks. Given the feeding behavior of Ac, it seems plausible that eukaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfers may also have provided adaptive benefits [23]. Increased sampling will be necessary to establish the extent to which such gene transfers made their way into the Ac genome and whether 'you are what you eat' equally applies to a diet of eukaryotes [23]., 
                Ac participates in a myriad of as yet unexplored interactions, as reflected in the diversity of genes devoted to sensory perception and signal transduction of extracellular stimuli. Ac's survival in the rhizosphere is likely contingent on interactions not only with other microbes but also on a cross-talk with plant roots through manipulation of the levels of the plant hormone auxin. LGT may also have provided Ac with some of its recognition and environmental sensing components. An interesting parallel is the planktonic protozoan Oxyrrhis marina, which utilizes both MBP and LGT-derived sensory rhodopsins, to enable selective feeding behavior through prey detection and biorecognition [85]. We predict that host response of Ac to pathogens and symbionts is likely modulated via a diversity of predicted PRRs that act in an analogous manner to effectors of innate immunity in higher organisms. Given the close association of Ac with a number of important intracellular pathogens, it will be interesting to determine which host-pathogen interactions can trace their origins to encounters with primitive cells such as Ac., 
                Ac shares protein family expansions in signal transduction with other Amoebozoa while introducing new components based on novel domain architectures (nucleotidyl cyclases) [86]. The presence of the complete pTyr signaling toolkit especially when contrasted with its absence in the multicellular dictyostelids is a remarkable finding of the Ac genome analysis. However the role of tyrosine kinase signaling in both amoebozoan and mammalian phagocytosis [87–89] indicates that it likely represents an ancestral function. The most parsimonious interpretation predicts the supplanting of functions originally carried out by tyrosine kinases by other kinases in the Amoebozoa. This emphasizes the importance of representative sampling and in its absence the inherent difficulties in re-constructing ancestral signaling capacities., Transcriptional response networks can be re-programmed either through expansion of transcription factors or their target genes [90]. Ac and Dd share a conserved core of transcription factors with any differences between them largely accounted for by lineage-specific amplifications. These may result in sub- or neo-functionalization contributing to the adaptive radiation of Acanthamoebae into new ecological niches., Comparison of Ac with Dd highlights a broadly similar apparatus for environmental sensing and cell-cell communication and implies that the molecular elements underpinning the transition to a multicellular lifestyle may be widespread. Such transitions would likely have involved co-option of ancestral functions into multicellular programs and have occurred multiple times. Our analysis suggests that many signal processing and regulatory modules of higher animals and plants likely have deep origins and are balanced with subsequent losses in certain lineages including tyrosine kinases in fungi, plants and many protists., The availability of an Ac genome offers the first opportunity to initiate functional genomics in this important constituent of a variety of ecosystems and should foster a better understanding of the amoebic lifestyle. Utilizing the genome as a basis for unraveling the molecular interactions between Ac and a variety of human pathogens will provide a platform for understanding the contributions of environmental hosts to the evolution of virulence."

The status of this project and our planned analyses are described., Sesame (Sesamum indicum L., 2n = 26), which belongs to the Sesamum genus of the Pedaliaceae family, is one of the oldest oilseed crops and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa and South America [1, 2]. Its cultivation history can be traced back to between 5,000 and 5,500 years ago in the Harappa Valley of the Indian subcontinent [3]. The total area of sesame harvested in the world is currently 7.8 million hectares, and annual production is 3.84 million tons (2010, UN Food and Agriculture Organization data). Being one of the four main sesame-producing countries, China has contributed 15.2 to 32.5% of the total world sesame production over the past 10 years (2001 to 2010, UN Food and Agriculture Organization data). Sesame has one of the highest oil contents: decorticated seeds contain 45 to 63% oil [2]. The seed is also rich in protein, vitamins, including niacin, minerals and lignans, such as sesamolin and sesamin [4–7], and it is a popular food and medicine [8–13]. Sequencing and analysis of the sesame genome is essential if we are to elucidate the evolutionary origins and characteristics of the sesame species., 
                Sesamum is the main genus in the family Pedaliaceae, which contains 17 genera and 80 species of annual and perennial herbs that are distributed in the Old World tropics and subtropics [14]. The taxonomy and cytogenetics of the Sesamum genus has been reviewed and debated for a long time [1, 14–17], and many heterogeneous landraces present in various growing areas still need to be distinguished [1, 18]. S. indicum is the sole cultivar in the Sesamum genus and evolved from wild populations [14, 19]. However, the origin and evolution of cultivated sesame is still unclear and requires more detailed investigation [1, 15]. Evidence suggests that sesame may have originated in either India or Africa [3, 20–26]. Bedigian reported that sesame was derived from the Indian subcontinent (the western Indian peninsula and parts of Pakistan) thousands of years ago, and believed that the progenitor of sesame is a taxon named S. orientale var. malabaricum Nar. [22, 23], although most species of Sesamum and genera of the Pedaliaceae are native to Africa [27–29]. We hope to clarify the origin and phylogeny of S. indicum by applying comparative genomics and morphological and cytological analyses., Sesame seed is commonly known as the 'Queen of the oil seeds', perhaps for its resistance to oxidation and rancidity [3]. As it contains lignans, sesame oil also exerts anti-cancer properties both in vitro and in animal bioassays [30–34]. Compared with peanut (Arachis hypogaea), soybean (Glycine max), oilseed rape (Brassica napus), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and other oilseed crops, sesame seed oil has an ideal nearly equal content of oleic acid (18:1) (39.6%) and linoleic acid (18:2) (46.0%), and has desirable physiological effects, including antioxidant activity, and blood pressure- and serum lipid-lowering potential [2, 35, 36]. Studies of the genome and functional genome of sesame are essential for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying fatty acid and storage protein composition and content, and the secondary metabolism of antioxidant lignans [37–40]., Sesame grows well and gives good yields in both tropical and temperate climates. Its tolerance of drought and high temperatures make sesame well suited to land where few other crops can survive. However, compared with other oilseed crops, sesame seed production is not consistent, as it is susceptible to pathogens, waterlogging and low temperature conditions [41]. Sesame breeding objectives, like those for other seed-producing crops, especially oil crops, are to create new varieties with high quality and yield potential, and resistance to pathogens (including Fusarium wilt and Charcoal rot diseases), insect pests, waterlogging, drought and low temperature stress [37, 42–45]. However, identification of genes or gene families and marker loci associated with yield, quality, and resistance to disease and abiotic stresses has been hampered due to a lack of information on the sesame genome. Only a few functional genes, mainly involved in the formation and regulation of fatty acids, seed storage proteins and secondary metabolites, and salt stress response, have been investigated [46–54]. With the exception of a sole amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker associated with the indehiscent-capsule trait reported in 2003 [55], no quantitative trait loci have been found in the linkage map of sesame, let alone used for molecular-assisted selection (MAS) in sesame breeding programs. Integrating desirable qualities from the few available excellent germplasm resources, including wild species, will not be achievable rapidly unless considerably more genomic and functional genomic information is available. In addition, sequencing of the sesame genome will facilitate studies of other genera of the Pedaliaceae family by providing a closely related reference genome., We therefore plan to implement a Sesame Genome Project and sequence the S. indicum genome using the Chinese domestic cultivar, Yuzhi 11, which represents S. indicum cultivars with a simple stem, three flowers per axilla, oblong-quadrangular capsules, and white flower and seed-coat color. Yuzhi 11 is one of the most important Chinese cultivars due to its high oil content (56.66%), resistance to fungal pathogens such as Fusarium wilt, charcoal rot and Alternaria leaf spot, and waterlogging stress. It is cultivated in the main production regions of China [56, 57]., 
                S. indicum is located in the asterids clade of the core eudicotyledons of Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2 (APG 2) [58]. Its phylogenetic position determined using sesame chloroplast genomic data indicates that Sesamum (Pedaliaceae family) is a sister genus to the Olea and Jasminum (Oleaceae family) clade and represents the core lineage of the Lamiales families [59]. Compared with the 19 families shown in Figure 1 (adapted from the NCBI taxonomy database [60]), Sesamum, which has 36 available genomes, is closely related to the Solanaceae and Phrymaceae families, but distantly related to other oil crops such as soybean (Glycine max), castor (Ricinus communis) and rape (Brassica rapa). At present, genomic information on the Pedaliaceae family is quite limited, as genomes from this family have not previously been sequenced.

                    , The Sesame Genome Working Group (SGWG) comprises six major sesame research teams in China involved in investigating genetic diversity of germplasm resources, functional genomics, and biotic and abiotic resistance, in addition to sesame genome sequencing. All members of the SGWG work under the Toronto Statement for prepublication data release [61]. The main goal of the Sesame Genome Project is to provide a fine map of S. indicum and facilitate global genomic and functional genomic studies. We have already released a preliminary draft assembly [62] of the sesame genome that can be used according to the conditions outlined in this letter. A detailed plan for the Sesame Genome Project has been made available on our website [62]., Natural sesame species can be divided into three types based on chromosome numbers, that is, 2n = 26 (for example, S. indicum, S. alatum), 2n = 32 (for example, S. protratum, S. angolense) and 2n = 64 (for example, S. radiatum, S. schinzianum) [14, 37]. The basic chromosome number in the Sesamum genus is X = 8 and 13, with X = 13 probably resulting from ancient polyploidy [37]. The size of a haploid genome of S. indicum (2n = 26) was reported to be about 0.95 Gb, with a mass of 0.97 pg [63], which is out of proportion with the 0.51 Gb and 0.97 Gb of Cerathoteca sesamoides (2n = 32) and S. radiatum (2n = 64), respectively [64]. Before beginning this genome project, we examined the characteristics of sesame chromosomes using cv. Yuzhi 11. Results showed that its karyotype formula is 2n = 2x = 26 = 6m + 16sm + 4st, and chromosome length ranges from 1.21 to 2.48 μm (H Zhang, unpublished data). We distinguished and numbered the chromosomes with 45S rRNA, simple sequence repeats (SSR) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequence probes using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and BAC-FISH techniques to facilitate super-scaffold assembly in the sesame genome (H Zhang, unpublished data). Comparing genome size with that of Arabidopsis thaliana [65], soybean (cv. William 82) [66] and rice (cv. Nipponbare) [67], the genome size of S. indicum cv. Yuzhi 11 is estimated by flow cytometry to be about 369 Mb (H Zhang, unpublished data). From our preliminary sequencing data, we estimate the genome size to be approximately 354 Mb, close to this result (see below)., The sesame chloroplast genome was published recently [59]. Sequencing of the chloroplast genome of S. indicum cv. Yuzhi 11 has also been performed (H Zhang, unpublished data), and will be used for raw read filtering and genome assembly in our Sesame Genome Project. A total of 86,222 unigenes with an average length of 629 bp are available and 46,584 (54.03%) unigenes have a significant similarity with proteins in the NCBI nonredundant protein database and Swiss-Prot database (E-value <10-5) [39]. Before the beginning of this project, we sequenced sesame transcriptomes from 24 groups of S. indicum materials and treatments using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology to greatly enrich available information on the functional genome [40, 68], obtaining a 40G dataset containing 42,566 unitranscript sequences. We also constructed a BIBAC (pCLD 04541) library of 80,000 clones with an insert size of 120 kb and a BAC (CopyControl™ pCC1BAC™) library of 57,600 clones with an insert size of 85 kb. The genome coverage of both BAC libraries was 27- and 13-fold, respectively (H Zhang, unpublished data). There are 45,093 S. indicum expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in the NCBI EST database. Prior to our work, only two other S. indicum seed-specific cDNA libraries, including one full-length cDNA library, had been constructed, some clones of which were chosen at random and sequenced [38, 69]. In order to explore more genes involved in sesame growth and development, we constructed a full-length cDNA library of S. indicum cv. Yuzhi 11 containing 300,000 clones, 1,200 clones of which were selected randomly and sequenced (H Zhang, unpublished data). The genomic and transcriptomic data from these studies should facilitate genome assembly and analysis. The first sesame linkage map, which contains 284 microsatellite polymorphic loci, was set up in 2009 and has been used as a landmark frame for assembly of the whole genome [70]. We recently updated this high-density linkage map with 653 SSR, SNP, AFLP and random selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci (RSAMPL) markers falling into 14 linkage groups to facilitate sesame genome assembly and anchoring of trait loci (H Zhang, unpublished data)., The Sesame Genome Project is divided into three phases. The first phase, which has already been completed, involves high coverage Illumina sequencing and draft genome assembly. We constructed five types of Illumina libraries, including two paired-end libraries with insert sizes of 300 and 500 bp, and three mate-pair libraries with insert sizes of 2, 3 and 5 kb. In order to avoid bias in library construction, at least two libraries for each insert length were constructed. Illumina technology was used to generate 98 Gb of reads, giving a 276× coverage of the estimated genome (Table 1). Subsequently, the draft genome was assembled using ABySS (v 1.3.3) [71]. Paired-end Illumina reads were first assembled into contigs. Mate-pair reads with insert sizes of 2, 3 and 5 kb were then aligned into the contigs, and the relationship between mate-pair reads was used to join contigs and construct scaffolds. As a result, a preliminary assembly of 293.7 Mb was generated (Table 2).Table 1

                  , The second phase will involve Roche 454 pyrosequencing and BAC sequencing and fine map construction. We have constructed Roche 454 paired-end libraries with an insert size of 20 kb and will generate 3.5 Gb of data giving a 250× coverage of the estimated genome. We also plan to end-sequence 40,000 sesame BAC clones using conventional Sanger sequencing, giving a 12× coverage of the estimated genome. To ensure hybrid de novo assembly of the best possible quality, we will use a modified Celera Assembler pipeline [72]. Roche 454 paired-end reads and BAC-end reads are better for spanning longer repetitive elements and joining scaffolds into superscaffolds. We will use BAC-end information to retrieve and select 1,000 specific BAC clones, one end of which aligns well to the scaffold while the other end is located in a gap region, for full-length sequencing using the Illumina BAC polling method. The full-length BAC sequences will fill in the gaps within superscaffolds and greatly improve genome integrity. At this stage, we expect to obtain a fine map of Yuzhi 11 with 800 to 1,000 superscaffolds of a putative N50 length of 1 Mb and N90 length of 250 kb., In the final phase, the superscaffolds will be anchored to chromosomes. We will first anchor the BACs containing mapped SSR markers on the updated linkage map [70] (H Zhang, unpublished data). Physical distances between landmarks will then be determined. Furthermore, we will construct a physical chromosome map based on at least 1,000 BAC clones using information obtained from BAC-FISH and BAC-end. At least one BAC will be anchored on the chromosomes per superscaffold to ensure all superscaffolds are anchored onto the 13 chromosomes. In order to validate the accuracy and integrity of the sesame genome assembly, several quality control parameters, such as read depth of coverage, average quality values per contig, discordant read pairs and gene footprint coverage, will be examined. To check the accuracy of the assembly of scaffolds, we will also complete full-length sequencing of 15 BAC clones using conventional Sanger sequencing and align them to the scaffolds., The blueprint for the Sesame Genome Project was conceived and designed by the SGWG in 2009. We completed the goals of the first phase in March 2012. In the second phase, Roche 454 paired-ends reads will be sequenced by December 2012, and the double-ended sequencing of the 40,000 BAC clones and full-length sequencing of 1,000 BAC clones will be completed by June 2013. The final phase of scaffold anchoring will proceed in parallel with bioinformatics analysis. We expect to complete all the goals of Sesame Genome Project and submit a paper by December 2013. To make our data broadly available prior to publication, the completion of each goal of these phases will be publicly communicated via our website [62]. Updated versions of assembly data will be made available to any independent research groups performing non-genome-scale analyses. Sequence data and the preliminary assembly produced in the first phase are already available on the website., The current draft assembly of Yuzhi 11 is 293.7 Mb in length, with a GC content of 34.65%. The N50 and N90 sizes of the scaffolds are 22.6 kb and 4.3 kb, respectively (Table 2). Genome size was estimated to be 354 Mb using the well-established 17-mer method [73], in line with flow cytometry data that suggest it is 369 Mb (H Zhang, unpublished data). The 17-mer distribution frequency in 16.77 Gb of trimmed Illumina PE reads was calculated using Jellyfish (v1.1.4) [74]. We identified a total of 13,931,658,332 unique k-mers, and 87,207,553 k-mers that had a frequency <10. The frequency of peak k-mers was 39 (Figure 2).

                        genomic sequence. Data produced from 500 bp insert libraries. The peak k-mer frequency is 39 and its minimum point is 10. Genome size was estimated with the formula: Estimated genome size (bp) = total number of k-mers with a frequency >10/peak k-mer frequency.
                    , In order to determine the frequency and complexity of repetitive elements in the draft assembly, we compared the assembly information with the Arabidopsis repetitive elements database from the RepeatMasker library (version 20120418) and the sesame de novo database constructed for the Yuzhi 11 draft assembly (RepeatModeler, version 1.0.5) using RepeatMasker (version open-3.2.9) [75, 76]. Thirty-eight percent of the draft assembly was identified as repetitive elements (Table 3), only approximately 5.7% of which shared homology with the Arabidopsis database.Table 3

                  , In order to control the quality of raw data, the SolexaQA package was used to verify the sequence data generated from each of the 17 Illumina-Solexa libraries [77]. The raw reads were trimmed by DynamicTrim (quality threshold Q ≈ 20) and then filtered by LengthSort (the length cutoff set as 25). Unpaired reads would be screened and discarded in this system. Meanwhile, Roche 454 reads data, which are kept in Standard Flowgram Format (SFF), were converted into FastQ format and evaluated using the traditional quality metrics. As Sanger reads may contain vector sequences, the Lucy package was used to search and trim for cutting off the vector sequence contamination [78]. Low-quality bases and chimeric reads would be tracked with trim modules of the Celera Assembler., We validated the coding region coverage of the draft assembly using two different gene footprint coverage methods. Using the Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) [79], 444 (96.9%) of the 458 core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) mapped against the draft assembly were identified. An RNA sequence based method employing Velvet [80] and OASES [81] allowed us to assemble 3.5 Gb of RNA-Seq reads (NCBI accession SRX061117) [39] into 99,589 putative transcripts. Putative transcripts were then translated into 82,549 peptides using ESTScan (version 2.1) [82]. These peptides were aligned against the SWISS-PROT [83] database using BLAST (E-value 10-5) to obtain high-confidence peptides. Redundant peptides (such as alternative-splicing transcripts) were filtered according to BLAST scores and the names of the hits. More than 99.5% of the 3,584 peptides obtained could be aligned to the draft assembly using GMAP [84]. The above results indicate that the draft assembly has a high coverage of the coding region., Gene prediction for the draft assembly was performed using InchWorm [85]: 3.5 Gb of RNA-Seq reads [GenBank: SRX061117] were assembled into 472,257 contigs and mapped to the draft genome using GMAP. The GMAP mapping results were used as a training set for ab initio prediction using AUGUSTUS [86]. As a result, 23,713 gene models were obtained with a total length of 28 Mb (Table 4). Average coding sequence length was 1.2 kb and average GC content was 45%. We obtained functional annotations of all genes using InterProScan [87], which also determines motifs and domains. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were given to 10,656 genes using corresponding InterPro entries and the Pfam database [88]. Visualization of the functional categories of these 10,656 genes was performed using WEGO [89] (Figure 3).Table 4

                    , We plan to address several key biological questions specific to sesame using this new genome and transcriptome data. We will compare the sesame genome with the genomes of monocotyledonous and other dicotyledonous plants to elucidate the phylogeny of the Sesamum genus and the origin of S. indicum. We will also perform more detailed investigations on the formation and regulation of fatty acids, storage proteins and secondary metabolites (including sesamin) in sesame. We will apply the bio-information obtained in this genome project in sesame breeding programs, paying particular attention to the induction and regulation of resistance to the main sesame diseases, including Fusarium wilt and charcoal rot diseases, and the environmental stress of waterlogging. Other possible uses of the genomics dataset, such as determining the regulatory mechanisms of biological characteristics in Sesamum, including simple stem or branch, leaf shape, indeterminate growth habit, flower number per axilla, capsule carpel number, flower color and other species-specific traits, will not form part of our analysis. We believe that the main achievement of this project will be to markedly accelerate sesame genetic research and breeding. Members of the SGWG also hope to address additional questions about the relationship between sesame growth and environmental conditions, such as identifying which genes regulate low temperature responses and drought sensitivity., This project is being conducted by the SGWG. We invite other research groups to access and use the draft assembly and raw read data, which have already been released. Any group performing non-genome-scale analyses, or investigating the above biological questions, is welcome to use our data without restriction. As a matter of courtesy and to avoid duplication of effort, we request that competing genome-scale projects or studies that overlap with the above stated research areas disclose their status to the SGWG consortium. Formal inquiries and requests to join the working group should be made to HZ. Updated versions of the genome assembly, further project descriptions and a complete list of current SGWG members dedicated to this project can be accessed on our website [62]."

We discuss how genomics may inform HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and eradication., Thirty-one years have passed since reports of severely immune-compromised gay men in San Francisco and New York first drew attention to the AIDS epidemic [1, 2]. It took 3 years to identify the cause as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, a lentivirus that subverts the lymphoid system to become viral factories producing 1-2 billion virions per day. HIV-1 infects and destroys CD4-bearing lymphocytes, decreasing the victim's ability to overcome normally innocuous agents such as Pneumocystis, Candida, cytomegalovirus and a score of other opportunistic infections (Box 1). Left untreated, these infections and certain rare cancers contribute further to the immune system collapse and to the demise of the patients. An effective vaccine is yet to be developed, and anti-retroviral drugs are not ideal since they do not work well for all patients, can generate adverse side effects and do not eliminate the virus from an infected patient. Since the first reports of AIDS in 1981, the world has seen more than 60 million cases of HIV infections, and 30 million victims have died as a consequence, 90% of them in the developing world [3]., The genomic era began eleven years ago with the release of the draft sequence of the human genome. A complete human gene set and DNA sequence was available to help combat the more inscrutable deadly chronic and infectious diseases [4], and this has enabled the investigation of HIV/AIDS using the new tools of genomics. AIDS exhibits abundant epidemiological heterogeneity, much of which could be attributed to host genetic factors. Beginning in the early 1980s, epidemiologists began collecting longitudinal cohorts of at-risk AIDS populations to describe that heterogeneity. Many collaborated with geneticists, who used population genetics-based association analyses to uncover genes with natural variants that exerted an effect on HIV infection, on the dynamics of AIDS progression, and on the results of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). This review will attempt to update the status of discovered host genetic influences on stages of AIDS beyond the informative reviews that have appeared to date [5–10]. We will highlight those host gene influences that are credible, replicated and implicated in AIDS disease, and we will discuss their clinical relevance in stemming the spread of HIV., Before the first of ten HIV-AIDS genome-wide association studies (GWAS) appeared [11], single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants in numerous candidate genes were suggested as being associated with HIV or AIDS in patients. Several hundred candidate gene SNPs were tested for association with AIDS progression and for HIV transmission. Over 35 plausible AIDS restriction genes (ARGs) have been identified (Table 1). Their discovery, replication and functional interpretation have been reviewed in depth, and these reviews should be consulted to appreciate the details uncovered around each ARG discovery [5–10].Table 1

                    All these genes were discovered or validated using the NCI-Laboratory of Genomic Diversity. Eight AIDS cohorts comprising more than 10,000 study participants were used in these studies from 1985 to 2011 [5, 10, 79, 101].
                  , The first and perhaps most provocative ARG involved the description of CCR5-Δ32, a 32 base pair deletion frameshift mutation that truncates C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the HIV entry receptor on lymphoid cells [12–14] (see Box 2 for a discussion of the origin of this mutation). Epidemiological studies showed that individuals homozygous for CCR5-Δ32 had a 100-fold reduction in HIV infection incidence: the genotype seems to confer near complete protection from HIV infection (Figure 1). Individuals in large cohort studies that are heterozygous for CCR5-Δ32, although susceptible to infection, consistently have a delayed onset of AIDS by two to four years, likely due to the diminishing onset of B-cell lymphoma [12, 15]. Further, AIDS patients on HAART live longer when they are heterozygous for the CCR5-Δ32 mutation, due to faster HIV viral load suppression, and progress to AIDS more slowly than CCR5

                 patients on HAART (Figure 1c) [16]. It is clear that latent HIV continues its pathogenesis in these patients, even in the presence of effective anti-retroviral treatment. We therefore need to develop better AIDS therapies.

                    , Individuals homozygous for CCR5-Δ32 seem to be relatively healthy into advanced age, suggesting that CCR5 function is dispensable in the human genome, a notion supported by the redundancy of other human chemokine receptors that also interact with specific chemokine ligands of CCR5 [17]. The knowledge that CCR5 is required for HIV-1 infection of lymphoid cells in exposed people, plus the suspicion that CCR5 function is dispensable for good health [18] (see Box 3), stimulated pharmaceutical development of a dozen new anti-AIDS treatments termed HIV entry inhibitors. Entry inhibitors were designed to interfere with HIV-CCR5 cell receptor binding as a block to HIV pathogenesis [19–21]. Two powerful HIV entry inhibitors, enfuviritude (T20) and maraviroc, were approved for AIDS patient treatment by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003 and 2007, respectively. The rapid development of this new avenue for AIDS therapy was clearly encouraged by the characterization of HIV resistance in CCR5-Δ32 homozygotes (the 30-plus other HAART drugs all target HIV-encoded enzymes: reverse transcriptase - targeted by both nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors - and the HIV-encoded protease)., A remarkable example of CCR5-Δ32 clinical translation to the bedside involves the treatment of Timothy Leigh Brown, dubbed the 'Berlin patient' [22]. Brown was a 25-year-old American living in Berlin in 1995 when he was diagnosed with HIV infection. Despite receiving sporadic anti-HIV medication, his condition deteriorated and he was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia in 2006. His AIDS clinician, Gero Hutter, prescribed a stem cell transplant of healthy HIV-negative donor lymphocytes following x-irradiation of his lymphoid system [23]. Hutter searched the European bone marrow databases to find an HLA-matched donor who was homozygous for CCR5-Δ32, so as to block HIV transmission to the donor graft cells. After the stem cell transplant in February 2007, Brown's anti-retroviral treatment was suspended to allow the graft to grow, though monthly blood tests were initiated to detect the inevitable latent HIV rebound. But rebound never occurred. Three years later, Hutter and his team reported that Brown had consistently tested negative for circulating plasma HIV since the transplant [23]. Subsequent rather invasive biopsies of multiple tissues (plasma, gut, brain, testis, liver) using hyper-sensitive virus assays were also negative, indicating that his body had been cleared of replicating HIV, the first such event recorded in history [22–24]. Though no one is certain that each and every one of the scores of human tissues that can become infected with HIV are clear in Mr Brown's body, as of now - five years later - his case is being heralded as the single documented clearance or apparent cure of HIV infection., Bone marrow and stem cell transplants are of limited promise as a universal therapy. They are expensive (circa US$250,000) and not very safe, primarily because even HLA-matched donors are immunologically allogeneic (that is, non-self). The immune system of the recipient must be destroyed, deadly graft versus host reaction against the host is common, and a dangerous transplantation therapy must be followed by a lifelong regimen of anti-rejection therapies. A promising alternative to this may be immunologically syngeneic (self) grafts with CCR5 knockout strategies. Carl June and Bruce Levine at University of Pennsylvania have developed such a protocol using zinc finger targeted knockout of normal CCR5 genes in HIV-infected patients [25]. Twelve such patients have been infused with their own-engineered CCR5
                -/-
                 lymphocytes. The results are promising to date, with donor cell reconstitution observed and few safety issues encountered, and several patients remained plasma HIV-negative several months post transplant infusion., News of the Berlin patient's amazing recovery travelled quickly in the AIDS research community and beyond. Attention was also paid to the fascinating secondary observation that the Berlin patient has never developed graft versus host disease (GVHD), a deadly reaction that afflicts 30-50% of bone marrow and stem transplant recipients. Transplant researchers at University of Pennsylvania reasoned that perhaps the CCR5-Δ32 genotype of the Berlin patient's transplant donor might have prevented his GVHD; this would affirm a role for intact CCR5 in GVHD. The availability of safe and FDA approved CCR5 antagonist drugs for AIDS, such as maraviroc, prompted a Phase I and II clinical trial to see if maraviroc-treated transplant patients might avoid GVHD, as with the Berlin patient [26]. A group of 38 cancer patients treated with maraviroc post-transplant demonstrated a dramatic reduction in GVHD without any major adverse side effects. If confirmed by a larger Phase III trial, CCR5 may therefore be implicated as a key player in cancer treatments as well as AIDS therapies. It should be noted that maraviroc is considered to be a safe drug and that CCR5-Δ32/32 homozygotes are generally healthy. If such bold new therapies do prove efficacious, they will stand upon the findings of the CCR5-Δ32/Δ32 homozygotes' genetic resistance to HIV acquisition and the apparent success with the Berlin patient., Each of the genes listed in Table 1 has the potential to have a detailed narrative such as that described for CCR5-Δ32. For example, HLA allelic resistance and susceptibility to AIDS progression is well accepted, and at least one HLA genotype, HLAB*5701, seems to predispose carriers to a severe immunological disorder (fever, gastrointestinal and respiratory distress) when they are treated with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase HIV inhibitor abacavir [27]. HLA genotyping is now a prerequisite to abacavir prescription. Epistatic interactions of HLA class I protein products and the killer immunoglobulin cluster KIR ligands (chr19] are powerful, but have not yet informed clinical practice [28, 29]., SNP variants within loci that exert powerful anti-HIV restrictions in vitro and against other viruses (TRIM5, APOBEC, TSG101, CUL5) have shown modest effects on AIDS progression in association studies (Table 1). Unlike CCR5-Δ32, which confers a complete loss of function mutation, the consequence of most other ARG SNP variants are limited by quantitative influences on gene action. An important predictive influence on HIV-associated nephropathy, particularly among African Americans, appears to be associated with multi-SNP haplotypes within the MYH9 (non-muscle myosin IIA) gene [30, 31]. The risk alleles are quite common in African Americans but rare in European Caucasians, which explains a 20-fold higher risk for HIV-associated nephropathy in African Americans. Taken together, combining functional data that connects ARG variants directly to HIV pathology, robust statistical gene SNP associations and clinical translation has improved our understanding of diagnosis, pathogenesis, treatment and ablation of AIDS., Unlike association studies of candidate genes, GWAS scan the entire genome with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of common human SNPs to discover genome regions that statistically associate with explicit AIDS endpoints in large cohort studies (Box 1). Fellay et al. [11] reported the first AIDS GWAS in 2007. Their study tracked the HIV set point (mean plasma viral RNA level over several months once the immune system has settled to a steady state level after initial spikes in virus upon HIV infection; see Box 1) in 486 European AIDS patients from the Euro-Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI) cohort that were genotyped with an Illumina 550,000 SNP array. Fellay et al. discovered three genome-wide significant (after Bonferroni correction for multiple SNP tests; <9.3 × 10-8) SNPs nested within the HLA complex, including a proxy-SNP in linkage disequilibrium (LD) HLA-B*5701, a known protective influence on AIDS progression. Since then ten additional GWAS using different cohorts, and different AIDS stages (phenotypes), arrays and numbers of SNPs, have appeared [32–41]. The combined GWAS have consistently fingered HLA SNPs, but agreed on little else., Additional GWAS-based gene discoveries outside HLA appear robust, but they have seldom included the candidate genes listed in Table 1, nor have the implicated gene associations been replicated by independent studies. Further, the fraction of the epidemiological variance of AIDS progression that individual or combined GWAS discovered genes can explain falls between 10% and 20% for AIDS progression and far less for other stages of AIDS (for example, HIV acquisition, HAART outcomes, and so on) [10, 11, 40]. Rediscovering HLA and the low level of explanative variance were disappointing to the AIDS community given the promise of GWAS for resolving gene determinants in other complex diseases. The advantages of GWAS over candidate gene studies are well known: (1) they can reveal genes we may not have considered since they survey the entire genome; (2) the patterns of LD allow for haplotype-based closing in on the causal or operative SNP variant; (3) copy number variants can be resolved by SNP genotyping arrays; and (4) subsets of gene families can be explored using SNP array data (see below). The disadvantages of GWAS are that there are no a priori assumptions about a possible connection to AIDS as there are for candidate genes; therefore, SNP association discovery must be complemented with additional function-based implication., The large number of SNPs interrogated requires statistical correction for multiple testing, and to avoid false positives the significance threshold must be stringent. Yet mixed among the below-threshold SNPs are a few gems, such as those in CCR5 and KIR, whose presence in pathways associated with AIDS pathogenesis make them too good to miss (for instance, many ARGs in Table 1 are not revealed by GWAS). Finally, GWAS cannot resolve rare causal variants (f <5%)., Goldstein has suggested that rare variants may account for undiscovered genetic influences on AIDS and other complex diseases [42, 43], but these genetic variants would not be uncovered by GWAS. Although it is impossible to predict future discoveries with confidence, the frequent occurrence of deadly infectious disease episodes in human history has clearly provided abundant selective pressures (possibly raising allele frequencies for CCR5-Δ32, HB-S, DUFFY, HLA and others) elevating many disease immune defense alleles above the 'rare allele' frequency. We also suggest that the study design of some of the previous AIDS GWAS might be improved by assessing clinical endpoint/phenotypes less variable than viral load, set point and CD4 cell trajectory. Although viral load/set point are valid predictors of AIDS progression on a course scale, in our cohorts the signal suffers somewhat from noise, and is also less continuous than survival analyses (using Cox proportional hazards analyses for detecting ARGs that influence AIDS progression). Better approaches for resolving the true association signals that fall below genome-wide significance threshold are needed if we are to maximize the potential of AIDS GWAS, and will likely require the evaluation of gene associations from a variety of perspectives., One recent example of a potentially 'better approach' is the recent GWAS that associated several SNPs within the large 1.1 Mbp PARD3B gene (chr2), a locus that regulates cell polarity in epithelial cells [40, 44]. Nine of the 15 lowest P-values in the GWAS fell in a short 5 kb LD block across a single PARD3B exon. One of the nine SNPs reached genome-wide significance (P = 3.4 × 10-9), while the others fell just below that threshold. The basis for the association (Figure 2) demonstrates that the rare genotype (GG) for the SNP almost never progress to AIDS, while people that are heterozygous for this SNP progress markedly slower than those homozygous for the common allele (CC). Support for the gene association came from six angles: (1) a nearly identical effect was observed among two distinct risk groups (hemophiliacs and gay men; Figure 2b,c); (2) the SNP association result was replicated, albeit with a weaker statistical strength (P = 0.03), in independent European cohorts; (3) one of the associated SNPs is a predicted exon splicing enhancer; (4) a quantitative measure of PARD3B splice products in lymphoblastoid B-cell lines with alternative PARD3B genotypes revealed a dominant 30 to 40% reduction in PARD3B isoform transcripts; (5) in the GWAS, PARD3B alleles explained 4.3% of the epidemiological variance of AIDS progression, higher than any of the other candidate genes in Table 1 similarly assessed in the same cohorts; (6) PARD3B gene products are known to interact with SMAD proteins, signal transduction modulators that mediate gene signaling, including through a direct interaction with HIV regulatory proteins [45]. Taken together, the cumulative replication, HIV1 regulatory connection, transcription influence and association data on PARD3B offers a plausible new genetic influence of AIDS progression.

(b) and (c) show the same association analyses separated by risk group (HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) and HIV-infected hemophiliacs, respectively) indicating a similar association pattern in independent risk group populations.
                    , The PARD3B study was intentionally limited to a single endpoint or phenotype (time of progression as defined by the AIDS 1987 Centers for Disease Control) to avoid statistical penalties for multiple tests. Yet many different gene association tests are possible with the rich clinical and genetic data we have collected across the years on these retrospective AIDS cohorts; indeed, many of these tests were performed and considered supportive in the previous candidate gene studies [7, 10] (Table 1). In spite of the aversion to multiple test statistical correction penalties, there is information than can be gleaned from detailed clinical data that should be explored. Hutcheson et al. [7] described useful heat plots that allow one to inspect the pattern of genetic association across many tests, as well as across small regions of the genome in strong LD. The combination of multiple non-independent statistical signals is a challenge to interpret, but in cases of known genes, such as CCR5-Δ32, HLA and IL10, the patterns are illuminating. The heat plots also provide a derivative approach to public data sharing of GWAS results without the problem of violating the informed consent and privacy constraints set out by Institutional Review Boards, which often restrict open access to human cohort data [46]. For example, posting an unabridged table of GWAS results online (odds ratios, P-values and confidence intervals), together with two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization heat plots, would allow researchers to freely inspect the results of a published GWAS [40], in any genomic region they may discover in a different cohort, for independent replication purposes - without viewing patients' confidential clinical or genotypic information., Now that ten AIDS GWAS have been completed [11, 30–41], it is important to share and compare these data to maximize the discoveries and minimize Type 1 (false positive) errors. Meta-analyses such as the International HIV Acquisition Consortium and the HIV Controllers Consortium are important advances that should be encouraged [35, 47]. Further, most of the published studies with any statistical power involve European Caucasian patients. Newer cohorts in Africa and Asia would increase the chance of discovering adaptive variants that may have arisen in those ethnicities in recent centuries. Such cohort developments are ongoing with the CHAVI consortium [48], the Botswana Harvard Partnership [49] and the Chinese AIDS collaboration [50]. It is also important to expand interrogation of critical stages of HIV/AIDS by exome and whole genome sequence analyses to capture SNP variants that are not well represented in available genotyping arrays [51]. Whole genome sequencing will offer an unabridged assessment of gene variants in these cohorts and will likely reveal additional host factors that regulate AIDS pathogenesis., A compromise approach between the specificity of candidate gene screens and the stringency of GWAS statistical thresholds is to explore certain candidate gene subsets represented within GWAS. This strategy limits the considered SNPs to specific subsets of candidate genes and lowers the multiple SNP test threshold for genome-wide significance. Hendrickson et al. [52] used this approach to explore the association of a group of human genes that are involved in mitochondrial metabolism, named nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins (NEMPs) [53]. Mitochondrial metabolism is relevant because AIDS pathogenesis clearly involves mitochondrial deterioration and cell death, because mitochondrial toxicity has been linked to several adverse events of HAART, and because mitochondrial haplotypes appear to be associated with differential survival to AIDS in longitudinal cohorts [54–56]., Two tested NEMP-encoding genes displayed significant (corrected for all SNPs considered) genotypic influences on AIDS progression: peroxisomal D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (PECI) on chromosome 6 and acyl-CoA synthetase medium-chain family member 4 (ACSM4) on chromosome 12 (Table 1). The gene subset approach allowed the detection of gene associations that would have been discounted in an agnostic full GWAS since their P-values of association significance (P = 6.5 × 10-6 and 3.6 × 10-6 for PECI and ACSM4, respectively) fall below a full GWAS P-value threshold., Another GWAS subset explored was that of genes required for HIV infection of cultured human cells, termed HIV dependency factors (HDFs) [57]. In 2008, four siRNA-based in vitro studies were published that collectively identified several hundred HDF genes [58–61]. Chinn et al. [57] identified 6,380 SNPs that occurred within 278 HDF genes and used a subset of the PARD3B GWAS study data [40] to test them for gene associations with HIV infection, AIDS progression and AIDS-defining sequelae. SNP variants in two genes, NCOR2 (also known as SMRT) and IDH1, showed significant associations with HIV infection, consistent with their selection from HDF genes. IDH1 was particularly notable, first since its HDF status was one of a few replicated in independent HDF studies [58, 59], and second because IDH1 can function as both a tumor suppressor (loss of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1] function) and an oncogene in human glioblastomas and other neoplasms [62–64]., The zinc finger ribbon domain 1 (ZNRD1) gene (located within the HLA locus) was one of the most strongly associated variants with HIV set point and disease progression in several GWAS [11, 33]. ZNRD1 also appeared as a candidate gene in one HDF screen [58], while Chinn et al. [57] implicated this gene as being associated with both HIV acquisition and HIV progression. These multiple indications of AIDS influence using different approaches (GWAS, set point and survival analyses) together make a strong case for the influence of the ZNRD1 genotype on HIV/AIDS., Thirty years of genomics investigation of AIDS has produced some important findings that have improved understanding of the disease and informed attempts to stem its deadly pace. Many host genes that affect AIDS have been postulated through candidate gene associations, GWAS, HDF analyses, molecular virology and other approaches. Many, but not all, of the implicated genes have been independently replicated by various approaches designed to overcome the statistical challenge posed by multiple tests (for example, CCR5-Δ32, HLA, KIR, IDH1, ZFNR1 and others). Most important, at least five discoveries have led to bedside translation: (1) development of CCR5-Δ32-based HIV entry inhibitor therapy [20, 21]; (2) HLA-based pharmacogenomics screening for B*5701-mediated abacavir adverse events [27]; (3) clearing of HIV from the Berlin patient by a stem cell transplant from a CCR5-Δ32/Δ32 homozygous donor led to gene therapy trials of autologous CCR5-Δ32 knockout in AIDS patients [22–24]; (4) use of the CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, as GVHD prophylaxis in cancer patients receiving marrow and stem cell transplants [26]; and (5) IDH1 discoveries have stimulated the search for drugs that block the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate for cancer [62–64]. These cancer-targeted pharmaceuticals may well equally inform HIV/AIDS therapies in the future., The disappointments of the ARG searches are several. The total number of ARGs described account for less than 10 to 15% of the variance in AIDS progression and far less for other AIDS-associated measures: namely HIV acquisition, HAART outcomes or specific AIDS-defining conditions. This means that most of the determinants (whether genetic or non-genetic) are yet to be determined. The stringent statistical threshold for GWAS may force us to discount real variants that do not pass the genome-wide significance level; we need to develop a solution to this conundrum. In addition, genotyping arrays used to date, which contain between 500,000 and 1,000,000 SNPs, cover at best 10 to 15% of the variants in genes and gene regions that we want to interrogate, so we depend upon LD to detect the causal variants through inference. We are missing much of the common variation, especially that found outside of genes (such as in the recently described 4 million regulatory regions [65]), and nearly 100% of the rare variants. Finally, because present GWAS largely target European Caucasian ethnic groups, variants accumulated in other ethnicities have not been thoroughly screened., The next generation of ARG GWAS will address and remedy these shortcomings as follows. Combined meta-analyses, such as the International HIV Acquisition Consortium [35, 47], will help affirm the statistically uncertain discoveries that are robust. Subset analyses such as the HDF and NEMP groups described in this review will help here. In addition, better strategies for data sharing of large GWAS and association studies will go a long way to encourage independent inspection, replication and composite interpretations. Bigger genotyping arrays (for example, Illumina 2.5M Infinium arrays) will increase coverage greatly. By far the most comprehensive approach, whole genome sequencing, will accomplish this ever better, but cost is still the limiting factor for this strategy. Further, the development of large HIV/AIDS cohorts in Africa and Asia suitable for GWAS and genome sequence analyses will be welcome additions to the screening of variants for important clinically relevant ARGs [48–50]., Finally, genomics is but one of several players in AIDS research and there are some extremely promising developments outside our field that must be mentioned. First, it is now well demonstrated that circumcision is a powerful protective aspect of HIV acquisition that is being implemented widely in the developing world to decrease the spread of HIV [66, 67]. Second, three recent clinical trials have demonstrated a powerful near absolute protection against HIV infection among high-risk gay men and heterosexuals who took a single daily combination anti-retroviral pill (such pre-emptive treatment strategies are termed pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)) [68, 69]. In a large global cohort of 2,499 men who have sex with men, those treated with Truvada (a combination of two anti-retroviral agents, tenofovir and emtricitabine) showed a 48% reduction in HIV acquisition; this jumped to 95% protection when only those whose drug-taking compliance was 100% were considered [68]. Similar results were observed in an African trial where PrEP-treated heterosexual at-risk women were studied [69]. Anti-retroviral microbicides are also making progress: two recent trials demonstrated 80% reduction in transmission among compliant study participants [70]. Last, in what may be his greatest legacy, former US President George W. Bush established the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2002, offering US$15 billion in federal aid for treatment of HIV-infected people across the developing world. He added US$48 billion to the program in 2008. In 2002 there were less than 300,000 people on HAART in the developing world but today, thanks to PEPFAR, there are 6.6 million people on HAART. President Obama has continued PEPFAR funding and there is now tangible hope for slowing the spread of this contagion through education, treatment and research. By interdisciplinary application of important advances, the real dream is to one day see a generation of people that are free from AIDS., AIDS is one of the most intensively studied diseases in history, providing not only a rich description of the steps in steady progression to immune collapse and death, but also discrete stages that can be investigated for host genetic influence. The process begins when a person becomes exposed to HIV-1, which can occur through sexual contact with an infected partner, intravenous injection with contaminated needles used to deliver addictive drugs, or receipt of contaminated blood or blood products (for example, clotting Factor VIII and IX in the case of hemophiliacs). Once an individual becomes infected, HIV-1 seeks out and overtakes CD4-bearing T-lymphocytes to produce a struggle between viral production (tracked as the viral load - the virus titer in circulating blood) and immune defenses that struggle to control viral proliferation in the beginning weeks. With more than 1 billion new HIV copies produced each day by an acutely infected person, and with new mutational variants arising at a rate of one every second virus copy, immune control is no mean feat. Nonetheless. in most infected people the viral load settles to a chronic plateau level, which varies among individuals from 1 × 103 to 1 × 105 virions/ml (known as the viral set point). Over time the virus gradually destroys the CD4 lymphocytes and the blood count drops to below 200 CD4+ cells/mm3. The time in which CD4 cell depletion occurs can vary from within a year of infection to more than 20 years later, with the mean time at approximately 10 years post infection. Once the CD4 cell counts drop, the patients succumb to a variety of normally innocuous infections (Candida, Pneumocystis carinii, cytomegalovirus, herpes, tuberculosis and others) and to rare cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma and B cell lymphomas. If left untreated, these infections and cancers almost invariably lead to death. In 1996, a powerful triple drug anti-retroviral therapy was initiated and offered a milestone in AIDS treatment and prognosis. In most patients receiving this treatment, known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), the viral load drops to below detectable levels. As promising as these treatments became, there were caveats. Many people (20 to 40%) do not tolerate the drugs and develop adverse reactions. The treatment does not clear HIV from many tissues, and suspension of treatment therefore invariably results in viral load rebound in the blood. Last, in spite of viral replication repression, there is still slow viral-induced pathology and so many patients continue, albeit more slowly, to progress to AIDS and death. Genetic researchers noted epidemiological differences in four principal stages: (1) HIV acquisition of infection; (2) the rate of progression to AIDS among HIV-infected individuals; (3) the nature of the AIDS-defining condition displayed; and (4) the outcome of HAART, viral load suppression, adverse events and AIDS progression post-treatment [5–10] (Table 1). Case-control and survivor analyses (in the form of Cox proportional hazards models) parsed into alternative SNP alleles or genotypes allow for statistical comparison for differences in patient populations that exhibit better or worse outcome for each stage, leading to gene/SNP association. Source: An and Winkler [5], reproduced with permission., The CCR5-Δ32 allele occurs at a relatively high frequency in Europe (about 10%), but is completely absent in native African and Asian people. This distribution, plus the high incidence of amino acid-altering mutations (about 80%) among all SNP variants in the CCR5 locus, lent support to the idea that CCR5-Δ32 was likely the object of strong selective pressures favoring CCR5-Δ32 frequency elevation in European ancestors [18, 71, 72]. The extended haplotype of SNPs around CCR5-Δ32 is about 1,000 kb, 100 times longer than the average haplotype size in Europeans, suggesting a recent mutational origin of CCR5-Δ32 and possibly a selective advantage of CCR5-Δ32 carriers [72–74]., But what was the selective pressure? It was likely a global deadly epidemic that CCR5-Δ32 carriers were resistant to, but it could not have been HIV/AIDS since this epidemic emerged in the early 20th century, too recent to account for the high frequency of CCR5-Δ32 in European populations. An evolutionary computation based upon the length of the extended CCR5 haplotype was used to estimate that the date of the latest selective elevation of CCR5-Δ32 was about 700 years ago [72]. This calculation raised the prospect that survivors of the Black Death (in which bubonic plague killed some 25,000,000 Europeans in 1348-1353 CE) had a role in favoring the elevation of CCR5-Δ32. A functional demonstration that cultured cells from Ccr5

                +/+
                 normal mice [75] lends credence to this provocative explanation. A more detailed narrative of the still unproven plague hypothesis is presented in [76]., There are alternative interpretations as to the cause of CCR5-Δ32-selective elevation (some have proposed that anthrax, small pox, Ebola and other contagions played a selective role in the rise of CCR5-Δ32 in medieval Europe) and even for Black Death etiology. Whether the direction of the allele frequency cline (gradient) across Europe tracks the plague progression or whether plague mortality was large enough to elevate CCR5-Δ32 sufficiently have been raised in critiques of the plague/CCR5-Δ32 hypothesis. Nonetheless, the functional connection of a CCR5 receptor requirement for Yersinia infection, the coalescent date of 700 years for CCR5-Δ32 haplotype origins, the enormous toll of the Black Death (an estimated 25 million Europeans - one-third of the population - perished by the Black Death) and the multiple plague episodes across Europe tracing from the Justinian plague (541 to 542 CE) to the 17th-century Great Plague of London (1664 to 1666 CE) all lend support to plague being a principal selective pressure on CCR5-Δ32 [18, 72, 76]., The evidence that CCR5-Δ32 was protective against AIDS, and also the object of historic selective events likely from infectious agents other than HIV in the distant past, has stimulated a search for other viruses that may co-opt CCR5 molecules as entry portals to human cells. One fascinating study using West Nile Virus (WNV) raises some troubling issues [77, 78]. WNV, a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first introduced into New York City in 1999, induces a fatal encephalitis in 20% of human infections. The agent has caused 17,000 infections and 700 encephalitis cases to date, and so far there is no effective vaccine or treatment. Philip Murphy's group at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were searching for other CCR5-virus interactions when they examined the WNV infection response of Ccr5
                -/-
                 knockout mice compared with Ccr5
                +/+
                 mice [77]. WNV upregulated the expression of CCR5 in the central nervous system of infected mice and this was associated with a massive infusion of CD4+, CD8+, NK1.1 lymphocytes and macrophages, all expressing CCR5, into the central nervous system (CNS). Survival and recovery in normal mice was about 60%. However, when Ccr5
                -/-
                 knockout mice (equivalent to CCR5-Δ32 homozygotes) were infected there was little immune reaction and the infection was uniformly (100%) fatal, implicating CCR5 as a critical innate host defense against WNV in mice. Murphy's group mounted a large genetic epidemiological association study of WNV-infected people and discovered that CCR5-Δ32/Δ32 homozygotes were elevated 4- to 13-fold among the fatal encephalitis cases relative to the survivors [78]. Clearly the intact CCR5 gene function exerts a critical defense in the face of WNV. The alternative AIDS resistance and WNV hypersensitivity poses a mixed blessing for homozygous carriers of CCR5-Δ32 and a stark reminder that genetic adaptation can come with a cost in a changing microbial environment."

In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share common properties between different species across different phyla. We used bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data., Our methods are compatible with all current sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to find tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. We assumed that the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA, which was true for most species whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a general property of genomes. High-copy centromere tandem repeats were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were highly variable in sequence composition and length. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence conservation beyond approximately 50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an overall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse species showed similar modes of evolution., While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically determined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromeres of both animal and plant genomes. This suggests a functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes.","","Faithful chromosomal segregation in mitosis and meiosis requires that chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules in a regulated manner via the kinetochore protein complex. As the site of kinetochore assembly, the centromere is the genetic locus that facilitates accurate inheritance. Deletion of the centromere or mutation of critical kinetochore proteins results in chromosome loss [1, 2]. Proteins and DNA sequences involved in most essential cellular functions are characterized by their high degree of conservation. Given their conserved function, the observed rapid evolution of kinetochore proteins [3] and lack of homology of centromere repeats thus poses somewhat of a paradox [4]., Centromeres differ greatly in their sequence organization among species. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a 125-bp sequence is sufficient to confer centromere function, and essential kinetochore proteins bind to this 'point centromere' in a sequence-dependent manner [5]. Point centromeres are a derived evolutionary characteristic, as ascomycete fungi more distantly related to S. cerevisiae have much longer centromere DNAs and do not rely on specific sequences to recruit kinetochore proteins [5, 6]. In the limited set of plant and animal species that have been previously analyzed, centromere DNAs consist of megabase-sized arrays of simple tandem repeats (or satellite DNA), sometimes interspersed with long terminal repeat transposons [7–9]. Some taxa exhibit higher order repeat (HOR) structures, in which multiple polymorphic monomers make up a larger repeating unit [10, 11]. When centromeric tandem repeat sequences of different species are compared, sequence similarity appears limited to short evolutionary distances [4, 5]. In fact, specific DNA sequences are probably dispensable for centromere function in most eukaryotes, as kinetochore proteins in diverse organisms can assemble on non-centromeric sequences [2, 12–16]. In humans, these 'neocentromeres' have been found through karyotype analysis and can arise at many different loci [17]. In some animals and plants, individual chromosomes - or even the entire chromosome complement - may lack high-copy tandem repeat arrays [2, 13, 15, 16] and in rare cases centromere repeat sequences differ between chromosomes [18, 19] The epigenetic nature of centromere location may be explained by the fact that kinetochores assemble on nucleosomes containing a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENH3 (CENP-A in human). Extreme cases of kinetochore protein assembly on diverse sequences are seen in polycentric [18] and holocentric chromosomes [20]. The former has a single very large primary constriction that contains three-to-five CENH3 foci [18], whereas the latter has CENH3-bound sequences and microtubule attachment sites along the entire length of mitotic chromosomes [21]. Despite their dispensable nature, the presence of tandem repeats at the centromere locus of most animals and plants suggests that they serve a function., Many questions about centromere repeat evolution remain unanswered. How prevalent are high-copy tandem repeat arrays at the centromeres of different animal and plant species? Studies of centromere DNA in animals and plants have so far focused on single organisms or on small clades [5, 22] and few review articles have been dedicated to a broad survey of tandem repeats [23]. No conserved motif has been found for centromere DNA except in small clades (for example, the CENP-B box found in mammalian centromeres [24]). Are there shared properties among centromeric tandem repeats from diverse animals and plants? In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and closely related yeast species, short centromere DNA sequences evolve three times faster than other intergenic regions of its genome [25, 26]. How rapidly do centromere tandem repeats evolve and which molecular processes govern their evolution? We performed a survey of tandem repeats in a large and phylogenetically diverse set of animal and plant species in order to address these questions., Conventional methods used to identify centromeric tandem repeats, particularly CENH3 chromatin immunoprecipitation, are labor intensive and thus difficult to do on a large scale. In this paper, we identified and quantified the most abundant tandem repeats from 282 animal and plant species using a newly developed bioinformatic pipeline. Our method can utilize shotgun whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequence data from various sequencing platforms with varying read lengths, including Sanger, Illumina, 454, and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio). Candidate centromere repeat sequences were characterized by a seemingly unbiased nature. Repeat monomers varied widely in length, GC composition and genomic abundance. Despite great differences in sequence composition, centromere DNAs appeared to evolve by expansion and shrinkage of arrays of related repeat variants (the 'library' hypothesis [27]). Using PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing to span many contiguous monomers, we characterized the mixing of repeat variants within a single array and the presence of higher-order repeating units. Our data greatly broaden the phylogenetic sampling of centromere DNA, putting evolutionary conclusions about this fast evolving chromosome region on a firmer footing., The ready availability of WGS sequence from a wide variety of eukaryote genomes makes comparative genomics an appealing way to study rapidly evolving tandem repeat sequences, such as those commonly associated with centromeres. Animals and plants are evolutionarily distant, so previous studies showing the presence of high-copy centromere tandem repeats in these organisms raised the question of whether this was indeed a general property. Recently, bioinformatic methods for identifying centromere tandem repeats have been described, and applied to several previously uncharacterized mammals [33, 58, 59] and plants [60]. We have performed the largest survey of animal and plant tandem repeats to date, encompassing every species with sufficient WGS sequence in the NCBI trace archive and DDBJ sequence read archive. The bioinformatic methods we used are amenable to every available DNA sequencing technology, making our study expandable as future DNA sequences are generated. In species with previously reported centromere repeats, the most abundant tandem repeat identified in our analysis matched the published sequence in almost every case. The presence of highly abundant tandem repeats in the large majority of species that we analyzed suggests that tandem repeats likely underlie the functional centromere in most animals and plants. Candidate centromere tandem repeats did not share conserved properties such as monomer length, GC content, or common sequence motifs. We found that higher-order tandem repeat structures were prevalent across a broad phylogenetic distribution, as was the evolution of repeats by mutation and indel acquisition. This confirms theoretical predictions that the tandem repeat nature of centromere DNA in animals and in plants can facilitate the rapid evolution of these sequences [52]., As centromeres can form on non-centromeric DNA sequences in both animals and plants, the function of tandem repeats at centromeres is enigmatic [12, 13, 17, 61]. Our finding that centromere tandem repeats are common reinforces the argument that they have a functional, albeit subtle, role, although careful experiments may be required to detect this in vivo. Further evidence for this comes from both evolutionary and functional experiments. Neocentromeres formed during evolution eventually acquire tandem repeats [62], and neocentromeres lacking tandem repeats are subtly defective in one human cell culture assay [63]. It is possible that centromere specification will be a balance between epigenetic and genetic factors in most plants and animals, although it is clear that epigenetic memory provided by the centromere-specific histone CENH3 is the most important factor., High-copy tandem repeats have a propensity to form heterochromatin [64], but it is unlikely that this property alone explains their presence at centromeres. Transposons in pericentromeric regions are also highly heterochromatic, and there is little in the chromatin landscape of large repeat-rich genomes such as maize that distinguishes centromeres from similarly gene-poor regions. Transposons inserted into the tandem repeat arrays of cereals and other plant genomes have not been shown to have a function in centromere biology, although they are bound by CENH3 [46, 65, 66] and centromere-specific transposons localize exclusively to the centromeres of close relatives [67]. Most interestingly, the tandem repeats within the CENH3-binding domain of the centromere have significantly different chromatin modifications from typical heterochromatin [68]. In A. thaliana and maize, tandem repeats at the functional centromere have been observed to have lower DNA methylation than those at the edge of the repeat array [69]. Extended chromatin fiber microscopy has shown that centromeres in Drosophila melanogaster and humans contain some modifications typical of euchromatin (for example, lack of H3K9 di- or trimethylation), in addition to those associated with gene silencing (hypoacetylation of H3 and H4) [68]. Tethering a transcriptional silencer to a human artificial chromosome or altering its acetylation/methylation balance can lead to centromere inactivation [70, 71]. Lastly, it is possible that non-coding RNAs may have a role in centromere function, and transcription of such molecules may not be compatible with heterochromatic marks [39, 72–74]., If specific DNA sequences play a role at centromeres, and heterochromatin is not needed for kinetochore function, why do so many animal and plant centromeres contain high-copy tandem repeats? The lack of conserved properties among these sequences suggests that it is the tandem nature of the repeats that in itself is useful. Nucleosome phasing may be beneficial for centromeres, and the sequence preferences of histones should lead to phasing on any tandem repeat even if this is a subtle property. Although one study failed to detect nucleosome phasing (translational positioning) at the maize centromere tandem repeats, periodicity based on AA/TT dimers (rotational positioning) within CentC repeats, which suggests that CentC repeats could contribute to a highly stable nucleosome arrangement in centromeres [75]. Nucleosome phasing over the entire centromere should be dominated by nucleosomes containing conventional histone H3, as CENH3 nucleosomes bind to only a small fraction of the tandem repeat array. In a phasing model, the acquisition and accumulation of tandem repeat arrays would be fostered by the chromatin arrangement of centromeres. The phenomenon of centromere reactivation, in which a centromere first loses kinetochore-nucleating activity and then regains it, could suggest that tandem repeats encourage centromeric chromatin states. Notably, centromere reactivation has been observed in both maize [76, 77] and possibly in humans [78]., Rapid evolution itself may explain the fact that centromere DNA in so many animals and plants is composed of tandem repeats. A prevailing model to explain fast evolution of centromere DNA sequences and CENH3 is that asymmetric meiosis during oogenesis encourages centromeric drive [4, 79]. In this model, competition of centromeres for preferential segregation into the single meiotic cell that survives to become the egg can drive rapid sequence evolution. Eventually, centromere DNA and CENH3 differences could introduce reproductive barriers, causing speciation. CENH3 binding domains in animal and plant chromosomes cover many kilobase pairs of DNA. How is it possible that these large stretches of DNA could co-evolve with a histone H3 variant? Similarly, how do centromere DNA sequences on different chromosomes co-evolve? In a tandem repeat array, CENH3 is necessarily binding to the same sequences throughout the centromere, and all chromosomes in the cell typically share versions of the same repeat monomer [80]. In addition, tandem repeats foster rapid evolution, and this property may be favored by meiotic drive [4, 52]. A mutation that arises in any copy of a tandem repeat can be amplified and spread throughout the array by unequal crossing over [52] or by replication fork collapse [81]. Repeat variants can move between different chromosomes in the cell via gene conversion, or possibly through the mobilization of retrotransposons inserted into tandem repeat arrays [82, 83]. As we have shown, the centromere tandem repeat array can be a 'library' of sequence variants that show expansion and shrinkage [53, 54], creating opportunities for new variants to colonize a chromosome, likely via concerted evolution or molecular drive [84]. Centromeres with sequence differences would be immediately exposed to selection in organisms with asymmetric female meiosis. Thus, the ability of tandem repeats to facilitate concerted evolution may explain their prevalence at animal and plant centromeres. Yeast species with symmetrical meiosis lack high copy tandem repeats at centromeres [5]. Similarly, the centromere-specific histone does not show positive selection in Tetrahymena species with symmetrical meiosis [85]. In the future, it will be interesting to test whether tandem repeats are found at centromeres of diverse eukaryotes that lack asymmetric meiosis., Our study is the largest survey of tandem repeats in eukaryotes. We identified tandem repeats from reads of widely varying lengths. It has to be noted that the most definitive verification of centromeric localization of tandem repeats (ChIP with an antibody against the fast evolving CENH3 protein) was not realistically feasible at the scale of this study. Therefore, we validated our results to published work (Table S2 in Additional file 3). Overall, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at centromers of animal and plant genomes, yet we found no sequence similarity between repeats from species that diverged more than 50 MYA. This suggests a substable yet functional role for such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across chromosomes."

Genes within segmental duplications are overlooked in most studies of selection due to the limitations of draft nonhuman genome assemblies and to the methodological reliance on accurate gene trees, which are difficult to obtain for duplicated genes., In this work, we detected exons with an accumulation of high-quality nucleotide differences between the human assembly and shotgun sequencing reads from single human and macaque individuals. Comparing the observed rates of nucleotide differences between coding exons and their flanking intronic sequences with a likelihood-ratio test, we identified 74 exons with evidence for rapid coding sequence evolution during the evolution of humans and Old World monkeys. Fifty-five percent of rapidly evolving exons were either partially or totally duplicated, which is a significant enrichment of the 6% rate observed across all human coding exons., Our results provide a more comprehensive view of the action of selection upon segmental duplications, which are the most complex regions of our genomes. In light of these findings, we suggest that segmental duplications could be subjected to rapid evolution more frequently than previously thought.","","Segmental duplications (SDs) are highly identical low copy number repeated genomic fragments ranging in size from one to hundreds of kilobases. They are important genomic features in the evolution of primates and humans for several reasons. First, the human genome harbors an excess of large, complex interspersed SDs relative to other mammalian genomes, with substantial mutational consequences relevant to both evolution and disease [1–3]. Second, the study of great ape SDs shows that, in contrast to a slowdown in the rates of other types of genomic changes [4, 5], there was a surge of duplication at the time of the African great ape ancestor [6, 7]. Third, a mutational active set of duplicated sequences, termed 'core duplicons', are enriched for gene sequences and associated with many genomic disorders characterized by recurrent, highly deleterious mutations [8, 9]. Overall, chimpanzee and human SDs also show an enrichment for exons and expressed genes [6, 10] relative to the much lower genic density within the SDs of other species, such as mouse [11]. Moreover, some of these gene families have undergone a rapid expansion, both in gene copy number and sequence content, with isolated but striking examples of strong positive selection in segmentally duplicated genes [8, 12]., It is well established that gene duplication is a major source of evolutionary novelty [13, 14], leading to the hypothesis that some of the fixation and subsequent molecular evolution of various SDs in the human lineage have been driven by positive selection on genes within them [15]. Positive selection may outweigh the deleterious effects of duplication events in gene dosage or in creating disease labile genomic regions [16–19]. However, the extent of positive selection within duplicated regions remains an open question., In humans, ascertainment of the targets of selection can shed light on our evolutionary past and may help explain key human traits such as our cognitive abilities [20]. Despite the intense work carried out in this direction, most genome-wide scans for the action of selection focus on single-copy genes [21]. Two major limitations to the identification of signatures of selection in duplicated regions reside in the methods available to researchers and the draft nature of nonhuman primate genome assemblies. So far, almost every method used to detect selection is based on the alignment of well-defined orthologous or paralogous sequences, followed by the study of their variability at the intraspecific and/or the interspecific level [22, 23]. To apply these methods to a complete catalog of genes and gene families requires high-quality sequences from several species of each individual copy of the gene family under study. However, whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing, which has been used exclusively to assemble nonhuman primate genomes, results in assemblies with a large proportion of duplicated sequences either missing or collapsed [24, 25]. Thus, it is challenging to create appropriate alignments for genes within SDs, from which reliable phylogenetic trees could be inferred allowing for trustworthy comparisons of rates of evolution., In spite of all these difficulties, some authors have attempted to characterize natural selection on SDs. For instance, Han et al. [26] presented the first attempt to determine the action of natural selection on all young duplicated genes in mammals, reporting that 10% of lineage-specific young duplicates show faster coding evolution than expected under neutrality. However, their analysis still depended on the accuracy of assembly-based SD annotation., In this work, we used a novel approach to identify genes and gene families that may have undergone episodes of rapid evolution. Our method is designed to detect regions with an overall excess of accumulated variation distributed amongst all paralogous and orthologous copies of a gene or gene family, instead of focusing on the variation found in each distinct orthologous and/or paralogous sequence. The measurement of global amounts of variation of a particular gene is achieved through the alignment of all WGS reads from all copies of the gene to the human assembly. Subsequent comparison of variation between exons and their adjacent introns allows the detection of exons with an excess of variants overcoming the problems of previous methods. Looking for fine scale events of accelerated evolution at the exon level instead of the whole gene level approaches can be useful if natural selection has been acting on a particular exon rather than in all of them, since in that case the signal might be diluted when averaging across the whole gene. This strategy does not require detailed phylogenetic information or high-quality nonhuman genome assemblies and can be used for the analysis of both duplicated sequences and single-copy genes., We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by testing its ability to distinguish between distinct evolutionary signatures (neutral evolution, positive selection, and negative selection) in a set of genes whose selective histories have been determined using other methods. We then identify 74 human exons genome-wide showing accelerated evolution of their coding regions since the divergence of Old World monkeys and hominid lineages, with a subsequent experimental validation of a subset of five human genes., Existing methods for identifying signatures of selection in duplicated sequences have certain limitations. We have used here a novel strategy that ignores orthology and paralogy relationships and focuses on the study of aggregate variants across raw WGS data. We used this approach to study accelerated rates of exonic change comparing human and macaque lineages, aiming to detect exon candidates after accounting for different potential sources of false positives. For example, we removed from the analysis tandem domains, regions with low coverage, and exons that presented a different coverage than their corresponding intron. Duplicated exons with evidence of coming from processed pseudogenes were also removed (Figure S4 in Additional file 1). After all these conservative exclusions, we obtained a final list of 74 significantly accelerated exons, out of which 5 were experimentally validated., We found an excess of accelerated substitution rates in exons totally or partially included in SDs. Only approximately 6% (10,634 out of 178,295) of exons in our analysis were included in duplications, while 55% (41 out of 74) of the exons in our final list are within SDs. This can still be an underestimation because we have found that within the set of significant single-copy exons the coverage was higher than the average shown for single copy genes in the whole set (Table 3). The variability found in the aligned reads suggested that some (at least 11 out of the 33) of the single-copy exons might belong to duplicated genes that escape standard SD definition (>1 kbp, >90% ID, or >10 kbp, >94% ID) [17, 18]. We have validated the potential duplicated status of eight of these exons by two different procedures (quantitative PCR or sequencing clones). All of them were validated by at least one of the two methods (Additional file 5).Table 3

                  , The enrichment in duplicated exons in our list of candidate accelerated exons could be due to our method having increased power for duplicated genes. However, since higher rates of adaptation in duplicated genes have been predicted [13, 14], albeit not proven, in humans, it is tempting to state that accelerated exon evolution has occurred at a higher rate in duplicated sequences. This would imply an important role of SDs in adaptive primate evolution while the rates of substitution in single-copy genes were slowing down [4, 5]. Neo- or subfunctionalization of different copies may have allowed the fixation of the substitutions that we have detected. Moreover, the fact that an exon is duplicated implies more opportunity for natural selection to act upon them., Our results cannot be taken as support for higher rates of accelerated evolution per unit time in duplicated genes, but only for a larger proportion of accelerated genic evolution in duplicated genes. This question will not be settled until individual sequencing and assembly of each copy allows the estimation of phylogenetic trees in all species and of rates of adaptation in their branches., A limitation of our approach is that we cannot ascertain in which branch or branches selection took place in the usually complex phylogeny of duplicated genes. For instance, in the application presented here, the method is based on counting changes found in reads from either the macaque or human genome, and thus we cannot clearly distinguish in which lineage changes took place. Most of the time the effect is driven by divergence between humans and macaques, but previous papers have suggested a burst of duplications in the African great ape ancestor, indicating that a fraction of the human SDs will be specific to the hominin lineage. In such cases, like NPIP, ANKRD36B or GYPA, which are highly duplicated in humans and not in macaques, it is reasonable to infer that accelerated evolution would have taken place in the branch leading to humans since their separation from Old World monkeys. Some of these genes have already been described in the literature to be under positive selection (NPIP [12] or GYPA [27]). Here, we present some novel cases such as PSG2, whose last exon has an almost twofold acceleration in the rate of change compared to the flanking introns (0.77 versus 0.48)., Within the initial list of gene families used in this study, we included the ten highly variable copy number core duplicons [8, 9]. Core duplicons are central elements of most humans SDs, are enriched by gene content and assumed to be involved in the evolution of SDs. Both NPIP and GOLGA, two of the most well-known core duplicons, harbor significant exons. LRRC37A3, another core duplicon, was rejected from our analyses in a previous step because it was suspected of harboring multiple pseudogenes., With the decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing, the field is now transitioning from single-genome comparisons to population genomics, where a high number of genomes will be available for analysis. The main issue for a successful adaptation of our method to the second generation of sequencing technologies is essentially derived from the shorter read length of the most standard next-generation sequencing platforms (at the moment, less than 200 bp). In the current version of our method, the longer reads obtained by Sanger sequencing have two advantages deriving, first, from better mapping precision and, second, from the ability to span intron/exon boundaries with a single read. Next-generation sequencing reads would indeed increase the number of false positives, since reads from processed pseudogenes, for instance, would be much more difficult to remove. However, third generation sequencing technologies (for example, Pacbio and Oxford Nanopore) that will produce long reads from single molecule sequencing should be perfect to reevaluate this method by providing extra power to span several exons at the same time and to study the haplotype structure and paralogous content of each individual copy., In this work we have detected some new candidate instances of accelerated exonic changes in recent primate evolution. Previously, only a partial catalogue of coding sequences, devoid of segmental duplications, had been interrogated for patterns of selection due to technical reasons. We show here that a substantial fraction of the genes that had been ignored harbors accelerated coding sequences. Overcoming current limitations of existing data and assemblies is crucial to provide a more comprehensive understanding of recent human evolution."

However, in de novo assembly, only crude metrics such as contig number and size are typically used to evaluate assembly quality. We present CGAL, a novel likelihood-based approach to assembly assessment in the absence of a ground truth. We show that likelihood is more accurate than other metrics currently used for evaluating assemblies, and describe its application to the optimization and comparison of assembly algorithms. Our methods are implemented in software that is freely available at http://​bio.​math.​berkeley.​edu/​cgal/​., Genome assembly is the process of merging fragments of a DNA sequence produced by shotgun sequencing in order to reconstruct the original genome. The assembly problem is known to be NP hard for a number of formulations [1–3] and is also complicated by the many types of sequencing errors, experimental biases and the volume of data that must be processed. For these reasons, in addition to differences in underlying theory and algorithms, popular assembly methods employ many different heuristics and assemblies produced by existing methods differ substantially from each other [4, 5]., Paradoxically, the difficulties of sequence assembly have been compounded by sequencing advances in recent years collectively termed next-generation sequencing technologies. Next-generation sequencing technologies such as 454 pyrosequencing by Applied Sciences [6], Solexa/Illumina sequencing, the SOLiD technology from Applied Biosystems and Helicos single-molecule sequencing [7] produce data of much greater volume at a much lower cost than traditional Sanger sequencing [8]. However, read lengths are considerably shorter and error rates are higher than those in Sanger sequencing. To allow de novo sequencing from short reads from next-generation sequencing machines several assemblers have been developed such as Velvet [9], Euler-sr [10], ABySS [11], Edena [12], SSAKE [13], VCAKE [14], SHARCGS [15], ALLPATHS [16], SOAPdenovo [17], Celera WGA [18], the CLC bio assembler and others [4, 5]. A key problem that has arisen is to determine which assembler is 'the best'. In the past this has been done with the help of a number of measures such as N50 scaffold or contig lengths - which is the maximum contig (scaffold) length such that at least half the total length is contained in contigs (scaffolds) of length greater than or equal to that length. Although simulation studies show that simple metrics correlate with assembly quality, the currently used metrics are crude and provide only condensed summaries of the result. They can therefore be very misleading [5, 19]. For example, the assembly consisting of simply gluing all reads end-to-end has a very large N50 length, but is obviously a poor assembly. Phillippy et al. presented software called amosvalidate [20] that identifies mis-assembly features and suspicious regions; however, it does not have high specificity and has not been widely adopted. Narzisi et al. used a feature-response curve [21] to rank assemblies based on features identified by amosvalidate. Studies such as [22–25] have discussed these issues and produce interesting insights into assembler performance but do not provide an intrinsic direct measure of assembly quality. The recent Assemblathon 1 competition used 10 different metrics [4] in an attempt to reveal more information than just N50 values, but most of the metrics can only be computed when the genome that is being assembled is known, and are therefore not useful in practice on real data., In this paper we present a computationally efficient approach for computing the likelihood of an assembly, which provides a way to assess assemblies without a ground truth. Intuitively, the likelihood assessment evaluates the uniformity of coverage of the assembly, taking into account errors in the reads, the insert size distribution and the extent of unassembled data. Genome assembly by maximizing likelihood has been proposed previously by Myers [26] and Medvedev and Brudno [1] but their formulations are based on simplified models that do not use important parameters, especially the sequencing error. To demonstrate the power of our approach for assembly quality evaluation, we have implemented our methods in a program called CGAL. We have evaluated assemblies by testing several of them from different programs with varying input parameters in a setting where the desired target genome is known. For each assembly, we compute the likelihood using our tool and then compare our likelihood computation to standard measures such as N50 contig values, sequence similarity with the reference genome as well as values reported by amosvalidate. Although it is beyond the scope of this paper to compare all assemblers and explore all parameters, our results indicate that likelihood is meaningful and useful for evaluating assemblies., Our overall approach is simple: we describe a probabilistic generative model for sequencing that captures many aspects of sequencing experiments, and from which we can compute the likelihood of an assembly. This intuitive framework is, however, complicated by one major difficulty, which is the problem we address in this paper: to compute the likelihood of an assembly it is necessary, in principle, to consider the possibility that a read was produced from every single location in the assembly. This results in an intractable computation, which we circumvent by approximating the likelihood via a reduction to a small set of 'likely' sites from which each read originated (using a mapping of the reads to the assembly). This requires an examination of the quality of the approximation, and leads to yet another difficulty, which is how to compute the likelihood for reads that do not map to the assembly at all. These issues are addressed in this paper and their solution is what enables our program for likelihood computation to be efficient and practical., We begin by describing the statistical model that forms the basis for our likelihood computation. We believe that our model incorporates many aspects of typical sequencing experiments, but it can be easily generalized to accommodate additional parameters if desired., In this paper we presented a tool for computing the likelihood of an assembly. The result can be used as a metric for evaluating and comparing assemblies. In the past this has been done using many different criteria including N50 lengths, total sequence length and number of contigs. The likelihood model incorporates these directly or indirectly in addition to other important factors such as genome coverage and assembly accuracy and combines them into a single metric for evaluation., We have also used our tool to assess the performance of assemblers using different datasets. Our results indicate that likelihood reflects sequence similarity, which is missed by other metrics commonly used and will be a valuable tool for evaluating assemblies generated by different assemblers and for different values of the input parameters."

 2012., In the opening plenary talk, Michael Arnold (University of Georgia, Athens, USA)
 recounted how his long-term population genetic research on hybrids of the Louisiana Iris
 has unfolded. An apparently disastrous flood changed the direction of one of Arnold's
 large-scale field experiments, providing evidence that the proportion of introgressed
 genes from one parental species dictated how well individuals survived flooding. A
 recurring theme of the conference, particularly in the study of genetic introgression,
 was that dissection of such effects in non-model organisms in their natural environment
 was most effective through the combination of new sequencing technologies with field
 surveys, experimentation and hard-won biological insights., This combination was exemplified by the work on hybridization between two subspecies of
 the grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus presented by James Hutchison (University
 of Sheffield, UK). Whereas laboratory crosses between the two taxa produce sterile
 males, the offspring produced in a narrow hybrid zone in the Pyrenees mountain range
 seem to be fully fertile. This result could be explained by thousands of years of
 selection, which might, for example, drive key sterility alleles out of the zone. But
 how could the key loci be identified from the many differences between the taxa across
 the whole genome? Hutchison evaluated candidate loci from expression data by analyzing
 allele frequency differences across the zone. This strategy exploits the long history of
 crossing, backcrossing, gene flow and selection producing the frequency differences., In the case of trees, a long temporal perspective is provided by the living individuals
 themselves. Kirsten Wolff (Newcastle University, UK) presented preliminary results on
 hybridization in lime trees. Ancestors, perhaps thousands of years old, live alongside
 their descendants, making them living fossil records and facilitating direct genetic
 comparisons over these extraordinary timescales. On the other hand, the existence of
 overlapping generations with their genetic contribution to new offspring presents an
 analytical challenge in the form of incomplete lineage sorting., The wealth of data provided by next-generation sequencing methods brings with it the
 statistical power to detect evolutionary change at a high resolution. Theoretical models
 play an important role here, separating evolutionary signal from noise and providing
 tentative explanations for differences throughout the genome. This year's theoretical
 talks put forward some novel and unexpected predictions that in some cases went so far
 as to defy the conventional wisdom. Daniel Weissman (Institute of Science and
 Technology, Klosterneuberg, Austria) gave a prize-winning talk about the
 counterintuitive effects of selective sweeps. Using both analytical theory and
 simulation, Weissman demonstrated that the random origin of advantageous mutations in a
 two-dimensional bounded population systematically distorts the pattern of ancestry.
 These mutations seed selective sweeps spreading out to the species' margins, such that
 the ancestry of the adjacent part of the genome will trace back toward the center of the
 species' range, resulting in a pattern of neutral variation that could be easily
 mistaken for a range expansion., In the case of genuine range expansions, Jens Nullmeier (Max Planck Institute for
 Dynamics and Self-Organization, Göttingen, Germany) argued for a clear distinction
 between phenotype-limited range expansions and those in which the population is limited
 by a slowly moving boundary. Nullmeier developed a coalescent model, and concluded that
 the different types of range expansions leave different genetic footprints, which can
 potentially be used to infer past population histories., Another prize-winning talk exploited genome-wide data to explore some challenges
 inherent in estimating species divergence times from very large numbers of genes.
 Richard Nichols (Queen Mary University of London, UK) analyzed a dataset of thousands of
 genes across vertebrate genomes, and discovered that estimates of the time to the last
 common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees vary greatly between human chromosomes. Yet
 most discrepancies could be resolved when certain multi-gene families were removed from
 the analysis, suggesting that gene conversion might be at play in driving this
 phenomenon. Following up with a theoretical model, Nichols demonstrated that gene
 conversion accelerates the rate at which species differentiate, particularly in the
 period immediately after speciation. If ignored, this effect could grossly distort
 estimates of divergence time or effective population size for surrounding parts of the
 genome., Genome-wide data can also be used to characterize allele frequencies at a large number
 of loci within the same species, as demonstrated by Brian Charlesworth (University of
 Edinburgh, UK), who presented work exploring the effects of mutational bias on
 stabilizing selection. Most standard evolutionary models predict that selection is more
 effective in large populations than in small populations as a result of weaker genetic
 drift. However, by introducing mutational bias into a model of stabilizing selection,
 the scaled intensity of selection is nearly independent of effective population size
 over a wide range of parameter space; if this model holds true, then it may be
 impossible to distinguish between stabilizing and directional selection from allele
 frequency data alone., Another challenge of moving from the laboratory into the natural world is that
 present-day biology will differ from that which shaped the evolution of the genome. Even
 attributes as fundamental as breeding systems are labile: Deborah Charlesworth
 (University of Edinburgh, UK) presented work on the breakdown of dioecy (separate sexes)
 to gynodioecy (females and hermaphrodites) in angiosperms. A dioecious population
 evolves to the gynodioecious form of sexuality when males become hermaphrodites by
 acquiring some female attributes. The study modeled the common gynodioecious situation
 and found that the frequency of females can be higher than hermaphrodites if the females
 outnumber the males in the ancestral dioecious population., Sonia Consuegra (Aberystwyth University, UK) explored the reasons why the fish
 Kryptolebias marmoratus might maintain some sexuality in an androdioecious
 population with many selfing hermaphrodite lineages. Consuegra's group found that, given
 a choice, males exhibited a mating preference for the more genetically different mate,
 although, intriguingly, the hermaphrodites did not. The observation of higher parasite
 levels in individuals derived from self-fertilization may explain the continued
 existence of males in this system., Heidi Aisala (University of Oulu, Finland) examined the balance of cloning and sexual
 reproduction in fish parasites. Parasites from the genus Gyrodactylus are
 predominantly host-specific, but with occasional sexual reproduction they can gain the
 capacity to switch host species. Thereafter they can continue their clonal reproduction,
 needing only one individual to start the new population. This strategy has proved highly
 successful, to the extent that Gyrodactylus host-switching is becoming a major
 economic and ecological problem. The movement of infected individuals by fish farmers
 has allowed the parasite to invade local waterways and jump to new fish species., Probably one of the most controversial talks at the conference was the final plenary
 talk, entitled 'Why I blog instead of writing papers', by Roderic Page (University of
 Glasgow, UK). A few years ago, Page shifted the balance of his publication toward
 blogging and away from writing academic papers. In a spirited debate, the audience
 raised concerns that this method of communication is more self-centered than
 conventional publishing. However, Page insisted that the use of blogging encourages
 feedback and ensures that science is a two-way discussion, as it should be. Page looked
 forward to a time when DOIs (digital object identifiers, such as those used for online
 articles in academic journals) are made available for blog posts, thereby making them
 more readily citable. He argued that these hoped for citable blog posts will be the
 future mode of communicating science. There are clearly still open questions as to how
 this scenario would work with regard to peer review and ownership of results, but Page
 nevertheless predicts that the worlds of blogging and academic publishing will begin to
 merge., The technological advances of the last few years are changing the way we do and
 communicate science. Next-generation sequencing technologies allow for large scale and
 high-resolution analyses of individuals and populations, revealing surprising patterns
 that feed directly back into the theoretical models. The way in which we communicate
 results is also being altered by blogging and other social media, and is forcing us to
 rethink the way we interact with the scientific community, as well as with the
 population at large. All in all, this is an exciting time in population genetics."

Although single-cell RNA-seq provides an opportunity to explore this phenomenon, statistical methods need to be developed to interpret the variability of gene expression counts., We develop a statistical framework for studying the kinetics of stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq data. By applying our model to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset generated by profiling mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that the inferred kinetic parameters are consistent with RNA polymerase II binding and chromatin modifications. Our results suggest that histone modifications affect transcriptional bursting by modulating both burst size and frequency. Furthermore, we show that our model can be used to identify genes with slow promoter kinetics, which are important for probabilistic differentiation of embryonic stem cells., We conclude that the proposed statistical model provides a flexible and efficient way to investigate the kinetics of transcription.","gene regulation, RNA-seq, single-cell, statistics, transcriptional burst","RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a recently developed approach that allows an unbiased examination of the transcriptome to be performed using high-throughput DNA sequencing [1–3]. Compared to gene expression microarrays, the previous gold standard for genome-wide quantification of gene expression levels, RNA-seq has some specific advantages: it allows splicing to be assayed in an unbiased manner [4], it better enables the measurement of expression levels over a wide dynamic range [1], and it allows allele-specific expression to be interrogated [5, 6]., Until recently, most RNA-sequencing experiments began with a large population of cells (> 105), and, as a result, the gene expression counts obtained can be viewed as an average across that population. However, recent developments in sequencing technology have enabled the use of much smaller volumes of starting material, and several groups have described protocols for assaying the transcriptome of single cells [7–11]. This is vital in many biological contexts, such as early embryonic development and tumor etiology, where it is expected that different cells will have distinctive expression profiles. Furthermore, even in tissues that are typically considered to consist of homogeneous populations of cells, inter-cellular variability in gene expression levels can be considerable. For example, the cells of a genetically identical population grown in the same environment have been shown to display substantial variability in the total number of mRNA molecules that they contain [12–14]. This variability can be partially explained by noting that gene expression levels are regulated by combinatorial interactions between numerous cellular components, where these interactions involve random biochemical reactions [12, 13, 15]., More generally, single-cell imaging methods (e.g., RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization or FISH) have been widely applied to elucidate the principles of gene expression regulation in vivo [16]. These studies have observed that: i) gene expression is heterogeneous [12–14]; ii) genes fluctuate between an 'on' and 'off' promoter state and transcripts are produced in bursts [17–19]; and iii) the transition to the 'on' state requires multiple rate-limiting steps that are determined by many sequential interactions between regulators and chromatin, but the transition to the 'off' state can be determined by a single rate-limiting step [16]. Some examples of the stochastic processes that play a role in the transition to the 'on' state are the recruitment of nucleosome remodelers and histone-modifying enzymes by activators, the rate at which RNA polymerase II (PolII) escapes from the core promoter to produce short RNA molecules prior to pausing, and the rate at which PolII leaves pausing and enters productive elongation [15]., One situation where stochastic fluctuation in gene expression levels plays an important role is in the regulation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells [14]. Mouse ES cells are derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) or the epiblast of the pre-implantation blastocyst [20], and they can proliferate in the same undifferentiated state indefinitely whilst retaining the ability to differentiate into all adult cell lineages. These two hallmarks of ES cells are conferred by tightly controlled gene regulatory networks [21]. However, growing evidence suggests that the ability of an individual ES cell to differentiate into an adult cell type at a specific time is determined stochastically [14, 22]. In particular, the expression levels of key regulatory genes, such as Nanog, Stella, and Rex1, which are markers of pluripotency, are heterogeneous in ES cells even though the cells are cultured in the same condition [23]. This implies that ES cells exist in a dynamic equilibrium between states that show different propensities for differentiation [22–24]., Here, we develop a statistical framework motivated by a kinetic model for transcriptional bursting to model the biological variability present in single-cell RNA-seq data. The framework derived makes it easy to perform parameter fitting and allows the kinetics of transcription to be investigated. We apply our model to single-cell RNA-sequencing data generated from mouse ES cells and demonstrate that the estimated parameters are consistent with promoter kinetics inferred from RNA polymerase II binding and chromatin state profiles., The Poisson-beta model provides a convenient statistical framework for modeling single-cell RNA-seq data and for studying the kinetics of stochastic gene expression. Since the kinetic parameters of individual genes inferred from the small number of cells are likely to be noisy and may be influenced by technical variability, we focused on the summary properties of genes. Importantly, we confirmed that the kinetic parameters derived from the Poisson-beta model are consistent with PolII binding and chromatin modifications using single-cell RNA-seq data generated from mouse ES cells. Our results suggest that the chromatin state of genes, defined by H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 modifications, affects transcriptional bursting by modulating both burst size and frequency, consistent with a recent study that suggested chromosomal location affected these kinetic characteristics [40]., However, while our model has clear advantages, it also has a number of limitations. First, in this manuscript, we do not address the modeling of the technical variability directly, primarily because our understanding of how different experimental characteristics (RT efficiency, PCR amplification, etc.) might contribute to the noise is very limited. Instead, we focus only on genes that are moderately to highly expressed, since previous single-cell RNA-seq studies have shown that such genes display less technical variability. However, as our understanding of the technical variability inherent to single-cell RNA-seq increases, it will be important to adapt the model presented herein., Second, in common with most other biochemical models of gene expression, we assume that the rate of transitions to the 'on' state is governed by a single rate-limiting step. While this assumption facilitates the derivation of a closed-form solution for the master equations, and thus the implementation of the Poisson-beta model described in this paper, in higher eukaryotes activation requires many sequential steps [15]. However, the limited experimental data about the relative contribution of the different steps justifies the simplified model presented herein., Third, the three kinetic parameters are currently measured in units of 'per mRNA average lifetime' since they are normalized by the decay rate. To estimate them in units of 'per second', we should directly measure the decay rates of all genes. This can be done by metabolic labeling of RNA with 4-thiouridine coupled with massively parallel sequencing [41]. Another improvement would be to measure the number of mRNA molecules directly rather than using the number of reads as a surrogate, which can be done by accurate digital quantification of transcriptome via digital RNA-seq [42]., Finally, our model assumes that the transition times and kinetic parameters are identical for the two alleles of each gene. A recent study established that 39% to 51% of heterozygous loci show allele-specific expression when expression patterns are measured in single cells of a two-cell embryo [43]. This suggests that the kinetic parameters and transition times of the underlying Markov chain might differ significantly between the two alleles of a gene. Further, Miyanari et al. [44] showed that Nanog is largely expressed from a single allele in ES cells and can transition between alleles randomly. Such variability can be incorporated into our model by measuring the expression of each allele independently (for example by using MMSEQ [45]), and using these measures as the input to the model. However, the mouse ES cell data we analyzed were generated from an inbred population of mice (C57BL/6J) and, as a result, we could not apply this approach. Examining allele-specific variation using the Poisson-beta model provides an interesting avenue for future research., To summarize, as the single-cell field progresses towards analyzing the transcriptome of large numbers of individual cells in parallel, it will become increasingly important to develop statistical methods that accurately model stochastic gene expression. In this context, we anticipate that the Poisson-beta model presented here, and other similar approaches, will be vital in maximizing the amount of biological insight that can be obtained from these data."

The study of translocation dynamics and their effect on gene expression has many unanswered questions (Box 1) but has benefited in recent years from the development of live-cell techniques for the study of biological systems. Traditional transcriptional analyses often provide an averaged output measured from a cell population [1], which tends to mask the behavior of individual cells. Using novel approaches, however, it has become possible to focus on transcription factor dynamics in individual living cells. In a study recently published in Molecular Cell, Yissachar et al. [2] use the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling system pathway employed by the immune system to examine the dynamic properties of NFAT transcription factor translocation to the nucleus in response to extracellular cues in rat cells, and discover striking differences in comparison to the previously characterized p53 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling systems., Temporal and spatial information extracted from time-lapse movies of cells expressing fluorescently tagged transcription factors shows that nucleo-cytoplasmic oscillations are common. For example, DNA damage leads to increased levels of the tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor, and its negative regulator, transformed Mouse double minute 2 homolog (Mdm2), in the nucleus. p53 accumulation follows an oscillating mode of approximately 6 hours for each pulse, while Mdm2 makes a delayed nuclear appearance but follows a similar dynamic pattern [3]. As damage increases, more pulses are observed, yet their intensity remains unmodified (Figure 1a). The basal dynamics of p53 under non-stressed conditions show similar pulses; however, these pulses do not culminate in gene activation, due to an absence of the post-translational modifications required to activate p53 [4]. Similar pulsation phenomena are observed for the NF-κB transcription factor after tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) stimulation. Asynchronous nucleo-cytoplasmic 2-hour oscillations begin as a response to TNF-α and continue for more than 20 hours [5], with the frequency of NF-κB oscillations acting as a control switch for the expression of different gene sets. Similar experiments performed under physiological TNF-α levels show comparable 2-hour pulses, although the response is substantially delayed, less synchronized and occurs in a smaller fraction of the cell population (Figure 1b), implying a mechanism of threshold activation [6].

(a) DNA damage affects transcription factor dynamics. p53 (green) exhibits more frequent nuclear pulses as damage levels increase (disrupted black and red chromosomes). (b) Increasing doses of extracellular stimulation (plus signs) affects the synchronization of the initial cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation time. High levels of TNF-α increase the overall population response, observed as elevated nuclear NF-κB (green) and increased synchronization. Colored plots represent the initial NF-κB nuclear translocation times (minutes) for each depicted cell. (c) NFAT isoforms respond differently to stimuli. Top: calcium levels modulate the frequency of NFAT4 nuclear localization. A rise in calcium levels increases the frequency of NFAT4 nuclear localization (green) bursts, which last for up to 12 hours, while NFAT1 remains cytoplasmic (red). Bottom: immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediates activation of NFAT1 and NFAT4. In response to low antigen levels, NFAT4 exhibits nuclear bursts that become sustained nuclear localization at high antigen levels. NFAT1 shows a gradual response to both low and high antigen levels, but with higher amplitude at high levels. (d) Unique transcription factor dynamics control gene expression patterns. Pulsed or sustained p53 nuclear accumulation (green) under DNA damage conditions determines cell fate by driving expression of distinct sets of genes. Pulsed p53 leads to cell recovery and proliferation, whereas sustained p53 ends in activation of senescence or apoptosis pathways.
                    , Yissachar et al. [2] have now used NFAT transcription factors as a basis for investigating how activation dynamics can vary between isoforms within a transcription factor family. The NFAT family consists of five protein members (NFAT1 to NFAT5), four of which are regulated by calcium signaling. All contain a DNA-binding domain, and have an NFAT homology region, which harbors a transactivation domain. NFAT1, 2 and 4 are transcription factors that function in T cells, and have been considered redundant owing to their high sequence and structural similarity. Indeed, knockout mice lacking a single NFAT gene exhibit only minor alterations in immune response, and it is only when additional NFAT genes are knocked out simultaneously that an acute immune response emerges. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that the transcriptional response can be differentially mediated by each isoform, either by way of varying expression levels in different tissues or by interactions with different co-activators. Since 'isoform redundancy' is nowadays a term less frequently used to excuse our limited understanding of protein diversity, we should assume that the distinctness of each isoform lies at intricate functional levels yet to be unraveled., Consistent with this view, the study by Yissachar et al. [2] demonstrates that NFAT isoforms harbor functional uniqueness. Using an elegant set-up for monitoring transcription factors in living cells, the authors examined the dynamics of the transcriptional response produced by two NFAT isoforms, NFAT1 and NFAT4, in mast cells. The authors dissected the temporal and spatial elements of NFAT transcriptional dynamics in response to various cues, such as an increase in extracellular calcium or an immune response. Their results reveal the true colors of NFAT1 and NFAT4 signaling traits and, importantly, the subtle yet biologically significant differences in transcriptional dynamics., Immunofluorescent staining of endogenous NFAT1 and NFAT4 reveals a cytoplasmic localization in mast cells under unperturbed conditions. Upon calcium stimulation, NFAT4 translocates to the nucleus in a subpopulation of cells, while NFAT1 remains uniformly cytoplasmatic across the cell population. Using two-color live-cell time-lapse imaging, performed on mast cells stably co-expressing GFP-NFAT1 or GFP-NFAT4, together with a marker of the cell nucleus, NFAT4 is observed shuttling in and out of the nucleus, while GFP-NFAT1 does not translocate (Figure 1c). The oscillating behavior of NFAT4 persists for more than 12 hours and consists of irregularly dispersed 10-minute periods of nuclear localization. Halving the calcium concentration did not reduce the duration of NFAT4 nuclear localization or its nuclear intensity levels. Nevertheless, low calcium levels did reduce the frequency of the bursts, as well as the percentage of cells that actually responded to the signal (Figure 1c). Altogether, these findings demonstrate that an intensification of the extracellular calcium signal strength increases both the responsiveness of the cell population and the number of translocation events within a time period. Interestingly, once the initial signal had been relayed, nuclear NFAT4 molecules shifted to a dynamic behavior free from calcium level influence. This dynamic behavior is probably governed by unidentified kinases or binding proteins., The calcium-stimulated nuclear translocation of NFAT transcription factors is mediated by their dephosphorylation at the hands of calcineurin phosphatase. Given that the same pathway is activated during an immune response, the authors tested the effect of immunoglobulin E (IgE) activation on NFAT translocation. Even though NFAT4 exhibited nuclear localization bursts in only a fraction of the cell population under these conditions, as observed with calcium treatment, its translocation behavior was notably different in that oscillations ceased after only 2 hours or so. Interestingly, an increase in antigen concentration brought about a long-lasting nuclear NFAT4 localization time (2 to 3 hours) in place of the bursting phenotype (10-minute bursts)., As with NFAT4, NFAT1 behavior also differed between calcium and IgE stimulations. Whereas calcium did not perturb NFAT1's uniform cytoplasmic distribution, a gradual nuclear accumulation occurred over the course of several hours. This redistribution was then reversed by a slow clearing out from the nucleus (Figure 1c)., Exhaustive comparative image analysis of NFAT1 and NFAT4 behavior in hundreds of cells revealed inherent differences in the dynamic performance of transcription factor isoforms, even when acting in the same cells and responding to the same extracellular signals. First, the difference in response times showed a unique behavior for each isoform. Under high antigen levels, the NFAT4 response was highly synchronized in the responding cells and reached 20% of its maximum amplitude after 1 minute or so. Decreased antigen levels led to a loss of synchronization within the population, but notably, even though some cells had a delayed response, the whole population finally responded. In contrast, the response time for NFAT1 was somewhat slower, averaging over 3 to 4 minutes, and was unaffected by antigen levels. Second, although increased antigen levels led to the doubling of nuclear duration times for both NFAT1 and NFAT4, the magnitude of NFAT4 nuclear accumulation remained constant, whereas NFAT1 exhibited a dose-dependent increase in nuclear localization., Autocorrelation analysis of the NFAT data attributed two kinetic populations to NFAT4 nuclear dynamics. A slow component (55 minutes) determines the overall response duration and is common to both NFAT4 and NFAT1, while a fast component unique to NFAT4 (1.5 minutes) is responsible for nuclear bursts. The rapidity of this response substantially differs from the prolonged p53 and NF-κB responses [3, 5], even though NF-κB can respond to the same Fc receptor signaling pathway., IgE-mediated activation triggers signaling through the constant presence of the signaling molecule in the extracellular medium. However, immune cells traveling in between cells and tissues are most likely to encounter brief and pulsatile signals, as observed during T-cell activation and calcium signaling [7]. To simulate such a situation in culture, Yissachar et al. [2] used antigen pulses of varying durations and varying signal strength. They measured a 60-second nuclear import rate for NFAT4, which was considerably faster than the 5 minutes observed for NFAT1. Correspondingly, nuclear export rates of NFAT4 were 3 minutes and 32 minutes for NFAT1. When the NFAT dephosphorylation signal was terminated with cyclosporine, a calcineurin phosphatase inhibitor, similar (fast) export times were observed for both isoforms. This observation is consistent with NFAT molecules constantly shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm during signal activation, with the net accumulation of NFAT molecules in the nucleus determining the amplitude of the response., Finally, Yissachar et al. established that NFAT1 accumulation intensifies in response to an increase in either the activating signal or the pulse duration. By contrast, the same magnitude of response was observed for NFAT4 irrespective of treatment, although each cell responded in an all-or-none fashion. For low antigen levels and short pulses, only 10% of the cell population responded, whereas long pulses increased this proportion to 65%, owing to more cells having an opportunity to respond when the signal persisted. Another recent study similarly showed a differential outcome on the activation of gene transcription between pulsed and sustained signaling of p53 [8]. In that study, short p53 pulses delayed the activation of genes regulating cell senescence and proliferation, while prolonged pulses accelerated the expression of senescence- and apoptosis-related genes (Figure 1d)., Yissachar et al. demonstrate that the mode of transcriptional activation can vary according to a transcription factor's nucleo-cytoplasmic oscillations, and to its sensitivity to the intensity and duration of an activating signal. Having established that these variations occur even between highly similar transcription factor isoforms, leading them to respond quite differently to the same signal transduction pathway disseminating through the cell, it now remains to be seen how these diverse outputs translate to changes in the dynamic make-up of the transcriptome. For instance, do transcription factor bursts in the nucleus result in stochastic gene expression events? Is the number, frequency or length of transcription factor pulses exploited by the cell to increase mRNA expression levels, or does a gene perhaps become desensitized to the signal after its initial expression takes place? By combining live-cell systems for examining transcription factor dynamics with those that are capable of tracking transcriptional output in real time [9, 10], it will be possible to comprehensively visualize and analyze the complete signaling transcription pathway., Crucial questions regarding transcription factor dynamics in the context of signaling pathways remain unanswered, even after decades of biochemical analysis. Questions to be explored include:, 
                
                    Is a single stimulation pulse sufficient for the activation of a particular signaling pathway and for the realization of the ultimate transcriptional response, or are several repeated inputs required?
                  
                    Are cells sensitive to different signal intensities, or are they instead responsive to the frequencies at which signals arrive?
                  
              , If we are to understand how cells integrate the information arriving at the cell surface into a physiologically meaningful transcriptional response, we will need to decipher the kinetics of the signaling response. A fruitful approach to addressing these questions is proving to be the visualization of transcription factors in action at the single-cell level."

The vertebrate limb has long been one of the most iconic systems in the study of development, so it is perhaps surprising that the genetic patterning processes giving rise to the digits are poorly understood. Indeed, while the digits might appear to constitute a periodic pattern, namely one where an element is repeated at regular intervals, it has been unclear whether this is truly the case. Some theories of anterioposterior patterning of the limb have been based on a positional information model in which a morphogen gradient from the posterior to anterior of the limb sets up a coordinate system that identifies the position of each digit [1]. Each digit could - theoretically - be uniquely specified by a different set of coordinates, not by periodic repetitions of the same process. However, in a recent Science article, Sheth et al. provide convincing evidence that the digits are a truly periodic pattern, generated by a so-called reaction-diffusion (RD) or Turing mechanism, and provide clues about how it works [2]., Turing proposed a simple mathematical model to show that periodic patterns could be generated by reaction between two or more morphogens (defined as diffusing chemicals that influence biological pattern) from an initially near-homogeneous state [3]. These patterns include oscillations, traveling waves and, importantly, stationary waves with uniformly spaced peaks - in other words, stripes or spots. Turing's ideas have been influential in understanding pattern formation, most notably as developed by Meinhardt and Gierer, who demonstrated that periodic patterning requires a short-range positive feedback and a long-range negative feedback [4]. An activator morphogen thus not only activates its own accumulation, but also produces an inhibitor that spreads in its vicinity. Multiple activator centers can arise spontaneously, but not adjacently, leading to a regular spacing., A model of digit patterning based on positional information was favored by the discovery some years ago of a gradient of Sonic Hedgehog protein (SHH) from the posterior limb (the zone of polarizing activity) to the anterior. Adding extra or ectopic SHH triggers polydactyly (that is, extra digits). However, 10 years ago, a major problem for a simple positional information gradient model of digit patterning arose when it was found that digit formation persists in the absence of the proposed morphogen. Specifically, Gli3 (a Shh-antagonized repressor of Shh target genes) and Shh;Gli3 null mutants , in which there is no gradient, also display polydactyly [1]. Therefore, while the SHH gradient clearly contributes to anterioposterior patterning of the limb, it is not required for the generation of the digits., Turing mechanisms had previously been proposed to explain the pattern of digits seen in the limb [5], but there was a problem with this too: Turing mechanisms have a fixed periodicity, whereas the digits spread out fan-wise by increasing their width and spacing wavelength as they extend distally (Figure 1). By using a combination of mouse genetics and a minimal RD model, Sheth et al. have overcome this problem by demonstrating the existence of a wavelength-modulating mechanism. They have thus simultaneously validated the relevance of a Turing model and revealed some of the genes that make it work in the limb.
                    Figure 1
                      
                        Modulation of periodicity along the proximodistal axis of the handplate. (a) Schematic of an embryonic Gli3 null limb showing a polydactylous array of digits fanned across the handplate. Proximal to left, distal to right. (b) Proximal (red) and distal (green) regions of the striped pattern along the anterioposterior axis of the handplate at the positions marked by boxes in (a) illustrate that to maintain the number of digits along the proximodistal axis of the handplate, periodicity must scale with proximodistal position (λ2 > λ1).
                    , The study set out to examine a set of genes known to affect the patterning of digits, the distal Hox genes. A double deletion of Gli3 and an allelic deletion series of the distal Hox gene Hoxa13 were generated, with the perhaps surprising finding that a reduced Hox contribution results in an increased number of digits. Crucially, the increase in digit number occurred by decreasing the period of the digit pattern, not by expanding the hand. Even more emphatically, they went on to generate a triple deletion series for Gli3, Hoxa13 and Hoxd11-13 showing the same trend, with the triple knockout showing a spectacular array of up to 14 narrow, tightly spaced digits., In wild-type and Gli3 nulls, digit thickness and spacing increases smoothly with proximodistal (PD) position to maintain the fanning out arrangement of the pattern. The authors showed that reducing the Hox gene dosage, by contrast, led to a leveling off of the period along the PD axis: the wavelength ceased to increase such that the digit-stripes bifurcated (that is, split in two) rather than broadened. This point was clearly illustrated by their simulations: when the period was scaled along the PD axis, digits did not bifurcate, but when periodicity was uniform throughout, bifurcations were seen., The authors argue that their findings have significance for limb evolution, pointing to the similarity between their highly polydactylous phenotypes and the many skeletal elements in the fins of sharks and basal ray-finned fish [6]. They speculate that the evolution of the pentadactyl limb of amniotes could be the result of the modulation of the Hox system., Sheth et al. tantalizingly leave the identity of the key molecular players unknown. Most importantly, they fail to identify the core activator and inhibitor of the RD system. This is in contrast to the periodic patterning of hair follicles, feather buds, feather barb ridges, the rugae (ridges) in the hard palate and zebrafish stripes, which are all examples of systems with identified key activator-inhibitor pairs [7–9]., Sheth et al. also admit that as the distal Hox genes do not show any graded PD expression, an unknown factor with a PD-graded activity must be an additional component of this patterning system. The authors suggest fibroblast growth factor (FGF) as a candidate for this role, and FGF does indeed have a suitable PD gradient [1]. Unfortunately, FGF is also necessary for limb growth, which makes it the ideal mediator of PD scaling, but also makes it harder to test as a digit spacing modulator., The paper by Sheth et al. is part of a resurgence of interest in Turing RD-type patterning mechanisms. RD models fell into some disrepute in the 1970s and 1980s, partly because there was little molecular validation of them (despite their impressive ability to produce convincing simulations of real patterns) and partly because positional information theories seemed to contradict them: whereas RD couples the morphogen distribution to the eventual pattern, positional information explicitly uncouples them, allowing smooth morphogen gradients to generate any pattern you want. But we are now beginning to reconcile these ideas: in the limb, Sheth et al. show that RD establishes stripes, while longer-range morphogen gradients modulate the wavelength proximodistally and impose digit identity differences anteroposteriorly. In fact, RD and positional information mechanisms are probably generally interdependent in another way. Setting up a reliable morphogen gradient in the first place requires some type of long-range feedback inhibition, for which an RD system is well suited, while stripes and spots merely represent peaks in morphogen gradients such that each can generate its own local positional information. For example, Müller et al. [10] demonstrated that the developmental regulators Nodal and Lefty act as a differentially diffusing activator-inhibitor pair in the patterning of left-right asymmetry. Similar activator-inhibitor dynamics have been implicated in dorsoventral patterning [4]; the period in these cases is a single wavelength corresponding to the entire axis., 2012 was the centenary year of Turing's birth, and it is fitting that it was also the year that saw real integrations of RD theory into molecular genetics. The linking of genes to how the hand is made is still highly incomplete, but it is perhaps now within reach."

Unfortunately, a multitude of genetic backgrounds and experimental setups, together with inter-individual variation, complicates cross-study comparisons and a global understanding of the mouse microbiota landscape. Here, we investigate the variability of the healthy mouse microbiota of five common lab mouse strains using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing., We find initial evidence for richness-driven, strain-independent murine enterotypes that show a striking resemblance to those in human, and which associate with calprotectin levels, a marker for intestinal inflammation. After enterotype stratification, we find that genetic, caging and inter-individual variation contribute on average 19%, 31.7% and 45.5%, respectively, to the variance in the murine gut microbiota composition. Genetic distance correlates positively to microbiota distance, so that genetically similar strains have more similar microbiota than genetically distant ones. Specific mouse strains are enriched for specific operational taxonomic units and taxonomic groups, while the 'cage effect' can occur across mouse strain boundaries and is mainly driven by Helicobacter infections., The detection of enterotypes suggests a common ecological cause, possibly low-grade inflammation that might drive differences among gut microbiota composition in mammals. Furthermore, the observed environmental and genetic effects have important consequences for experimental design in mouse microbiome research.","","An accumulating body of evidence supports the central role of the intestinal microbiota in maintaining its host's health. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is linked to many chronic disorders [1], such as inflammatory bowel disease [2–4], obesity [5–7], rheumatoid arthritis [8], autoimmune encephalomyelitis [9, 10], type 1 [11, 12] and type 2 diabetes [13], and allergic diseases [14]., The gut flora composition is known to vary among healthy individuals [15–18], along the intestinal tract [19–21], and over time [22, 23]. Although the factors influencing the species composition and functionality of the healthy gut flora are still being revealed, food [24–26], drug uptake [14, 27], inoculation at birth [28, 29], host genetics [6] and as yet unknown environmental factors all seem to play a role [30]. Concomitantly, the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in shaping the host's immune system [8, 31, 32] and physiology [5, 8, 33]., Due to limitations of human research, the details behind many of these processes are still unknown. Therefore, murine models have become crucial in gut microbiota research for gaining mechanistic insights into gut flora establishment and upkeep. Such models can be used to investigate the effects of food and drug uptake or the interplay between host and microbiota, demonstrating causality in disease and therefore the relevance of these model systems [34–37]. Knock-out and transgenic models have shown that host genes can influence the microbiota composition [38–41], have given insights into signaling cascades that mediate microbiome-host interactions [31, 32, 42, 43] and enabled the study of the interplay between host physiology and microbiota composition [44–46]., However, various confounding factors can hamper the interpretation and comparison of community shifts in rodent model research. Among these are cage effects [47, 48], inter-individual variation [22, 49], genetic background [50–52] and maternal effects [50, 52, 53]. Here, we present data regarding the relative contribution of cage effects, genetic background and inter-individual variation to the murine microbiota in laboratory mice in a mixed co-housing design. Using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing-based profiling, we determined the baseline species composition of five different strains, investigated enterotype stratification and quantified the relative contribution of genetic and environmental effects to the overall variation of the murine gut microbiota. Finally, we discuss the consequences of our findings for the experimental design of microbiota studies in murine disease models., In this study we compare the healthy mouse microbiome of different common laboratory strains. We identified two distinct enterotype-like subpopulations in our study group, separated by richness and independent of strain and cage. Stratifying for these two populations, we show the impact of genetic versus environmental factors on the murine gut microbiota., The strongest signal separating our dataset is the presence of two enterotype clusters, different in species composition and diversity, which were strongly supported using multiple metrics and evaluation criteria. The phylogenetic composition is highly similar to two of the recently described human enterotypes: the low richness cluster is dominated by Bacteroidetes, while the high richness cluster is dominated by Ruminococcaceae and several other genera, which suggests that the two clusters found here might overlap with the first and third human enterotype and may possibly be influenced by the same ecological drivers. Furthermore, these results agree with the observed difference in diversity between Firmicutes- or Bacteroides-dominated subgroups found in a human cohort [59]. All these observations suggest that enteroype-like community structures exist in laboratory mice and that their ecology might be similar to that of the human microbiota, despite the known gut microbial compositional differences between human and mouse, suggesting that enterotypes are possibly a universal feature across mammals., As low species richness was observed in obese people [6] and inflammatory bowel disease patients [65, 66], in which it was associated with inflammation signs in the host, we suspected that the low richness observed here might be linked to (low-grade) inflammation as other confounding factors, such as diet [26], were accounted for in this setup. Another indication came from a very significant increase in Enterobactericeae in the low richness cluster, a group that has been associated with induction of low grade inflammation through lipopolysaccharide [67]. Indeed, calprotectin levels were increased in the low richness enterotype samples, confirming our hypothesis. Likewise, a recent study employing a colitis susceptible model showed that inflamed mice had a lowered gut microbiota richness as well as increased Enterobacteriaceae abundance [68]. The observation that low-grade inflammation can occur in young, healthy specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice provides a first hypothesis of the occurrence of the second enterotype. Whether inflammation, low richness or the specific bacterial composition of the low richness enterotype (including inflammation-inducing genera) is causal to the other is unclear from our data - also, a combination of cause and consequence (for example, inflammation contributing to a more inflammatory microbiota) is possible. Further studies using larger quantities of mice for each strain, in conjunction with detailed immunological profiling, possibly with a time-series design, will be needed to fully disentangle the ecology behind the observed groups. Such studies will also be able to determine whether the enterotypes are discrete entities or reflect ecological gradients [69], as the enterotype concept does not exclude gradient behavior [16]. In this regard, the three intermediate samples in Figure 1a that are unstable in cluster identity upon resampling are of particular interest. They could (i) represent a stable state existing between the two main enterotypes determining a third cluster, (ii) stably lie on a less populated ecological gradient between ET1 and 2, or (iii) represent a temporarily unstable state between the two enterotypes (that is, be 'underway' from ET1 to ET2)., The second, Prevotella-associated enterotype, as described in human [16, 26], was not detected in our data. This absence might be due to the fact that the Prevotella enterotype has been the least prevalent enterotype [16] and our sample size might not be big enough to capture it. In addition, the abundance of this genus has been shown to be sensitive to food intake in both humans [26, 70, 71] as well as in mice [72] - the uniform nutrition within our experimental setup might have hampered the observation of this third type. This said, there is no a priori need to observe three enterotypes in mouse and the Prevotella type might be human-specific. Future experiments with larger sample size that include diet variation should be able to resolve this issue., We find that genetic effects influence the composition of gut microbiota in five mouse strains that are commonly used in biomedical research. Although microbiota differences between strains have been observed before [50, 51], this is the first study that takes into account the interaction between genetic background and micro-environment as well as other stochastic effects that shape gut microbiome composition. Furthermore, the depth of resolution provided by 16S rDNA pyrosequencing enabled us to quantify its contribution to the overall variation and identify multiple lineages associated with each mouse strain. We found that the genetic effect is strongest at the phylum level (26.55%) and comprises up to 15.65 to 18.62% of the explained variation in the microbiome at lower phylogenetic levels. Thus, it appears that host genetics is influencing the gut metagenome mostly at higher phylogenetic levels. From an evolutionary point of view this strategy is more plausible as broad-spectrum control based on conserved features would be more efficient. Furthermore, these observations are in line with the recent report of higher phylogenetic level control of gut microbiota composition by variable, strain-specific α-defensin expression [73, 74]. Likewise, bile acid secretion was shown to affect gut microbiota composition mostly at phylum level [75], and its secretion rate as well as pool size varies between genotypes [76, 77]. These observations provide first mechanistic hypotheses why host genetic control would mainly act at higher levels., Not only is the microbiota composition significantly different between mouse strains, but we find evidence that genetic similarity is correlated to microbiome similarity. This implies that polygenetic markers actively influence gut microbiota composition, and with higher divergence between strains, these as yet unidentified loci are subjected to divergence. However, this distinction was only possible on the phylum and genus levels, as our work was limited by the number of strains available for comparison and a greater number of strains would be required to establish the exact nature of the genetic-microbiota distance relationship., In addition, we show that the cage effect accounts for a large fraction (up to 30%) of the observed variance in microbiome studies, which has important consequences for experimental design. Our results suggest that the gut microbiota of mice within each cage synchronize to a limited degree and thus influence study outcomes. Indeed, two recent studies [48, 78] demonstrated that microbiota-related phenotypes can be transferred between co-housed mice after several weeks of sharing a cage. Here, we observed that this can even happen across different strains, showing the strength of this effect. Gastrointestinal tract synchronization is likely achieved through coprophagy [47]; however, this has not been proven so far. This means that in a typical cross-sectional experimental design, the groups of interest should be kept in a mixed microenvironment, that is, in the same cages, or be separated individually. Otherwise, seeming differences between groups could be solely due to microbiota synchronization within the to-be-compared groups within the same cage. Although a mixed set-up might cause the non-detection of weaker signals because of synchronization between the case and control groups, it does give more weight to signals that are detected against this counteracting force. As reported in this study, the cage effect has the strongest influence on lower taxonomic levels. Thus, studies focusing on microbial differences at the strain level need to take special care to account for within-cage synchronization. In our dataset we identified Helicobacter as one of the main drivers of the cage effect, a genus found in other studies to be a sensitive component of the environment [64]. Helicobacter is inherently able to overcome the acid gut barrier and thus a steady influx of Helicobacter through coprophagy might help this genus to establish in co-caged, unaffected individuals., Next to an important contribution by (stochastic) individual variation, we show that both genetic and cage (environmental) effects influence the gut microbiota, with the cage effect explaining a slightly bigger fraction of the variance. While the cage effect becomes more important at lower phylogenetic levels, the genetic effect is more important at the higher phylogenetic levels; thus, it appears that the strength of these effects varies in opposite directions along the gradient of taxonomical resolution., We show first evidence for the existence of enterotypes in mice as found in humans, suggesting that bacterial gut communities converge into a limited set of stable states, possibly driven by or even contributing to inflammation. Furthermore, our results also show the influence of genetic background and environment on laboratory mouse microbiota composition, stressing the importance of careful experimental design and population stratification before or during analysis. This work underscores the great complexity of host-environment-microbiota interactions, but also brings us one step closer to untangling this fascinating interplay."

It is frequently over-expressed in cancer and is emerging as an important therapeutic target. In breast cancer FOXM1 expression is linked with estrogen receptor (ERα) activity and resistance to endocrine therapies, with high levels correlated with poor prognosis. However, the precise role of FOXM1 in ER positive breast cancer is not yet fully understood., The study utilizes chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing to map FOXM1 binding in both ERα-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines. The comparison between binding site distributions in the two cell lines uncovered a previously undescribed relationship between binding of FOXM1 and ERα. Further molecular analyses demonstrated that these two factors can bind simultaneously at genomic sites and furthermore that FOXM1 regulates the transcriptional activity of ERα via interaction with the coactivator CARM1. Inhibition of FOXM1 activity using the natural product thiostrepton revealed down-regulation of a set of FOXM1-regulated genes that are correlated with patient outcome in clinical breast cancer samples., These findings reveal a novel role for FOXM1 in ERα transcriptional activity in breast cancer and uncover a FOXM1-regulated gene signature associated with ER-positive breast cancer patient prognosis.","","The forkhead transcription factor FOXM1 is a key regulator of the cell cycle [1, 2] critical for the G1 to S phase transition and G2 to M progression [3]. Expression of FOXM1 is essential for mitotic spindle assembly and correct chromosome segregation with depletion leading to mitotic catastrophe and cell cycle arrest [4]. FOXM1 is also known to regulate the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis [5], metastasis [6] and response to oxidative stress and DNA damage [7, 8]. Overexpression of FOXM1 has been reported in many types of cancer [9] and is correlated with poor prognosis [10, 11]. Aberrant FOXM1 expression is an early event in oncogenesis [12], possibly acting as an initiating factor [13] and has been associated with genomic instability [12]., Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women and numerous studies have shown a correlation between FOXM1 expression and breast cancer progression [4, 14, 15], suggesting that FOXM1 is a potential prognostic breast tumor marker [16]. FOXM1 expression in breast cancer was found to correlate with levels of YWHAZ, a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins [17] and also with HER2 status [15, 16]. Meta-analysis of gene expression data from breast cancer patient studies identified FOXM1 as one of 117 genes comprising a gene expression signature predictive of survival [18]. FOXM1 over-expression has also been linked with drug resistance in breast cancer chemotherapy [19, 20] and therefore poor clinical prognosis., Approximately 70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ERα)-positive and there is increasing evidence to suggest that ERα and FOXM1 act as co-regulators. FOXM1 and ERα regulate the expression of each other in a positive cross-regulatory loop [21, 22]. FOXM1 has previously been identified as an ERα-responsive gene [23] and has been suggested to act as a prognostic marker in endocrine-positive cancers [24]. Furthermore, resistance to anti-estrogen treatment has been correlated with increased FOXM1 expression [21]., We investigated the relationship between FOXM1 and ERα in breast cancer by mapping global FOXM1 binding in an ERα-positive cell line (MCF7) and an ERα-negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). We show that there are cell-line dependent patterns of FOXM1 binding. We identify a common set of FOXM1 binding sites in the promoter regions of cell cycle-regulating genes but additionally in MCF7 cells; the majority of binding is located in intronic and intragenic regions with a high concordance to ERα binding, similar to the distribution of FOXA1 [25], another forkhead factor. These data suggest a distinct role for FOXM1 in different cellular contexts., The forkhead factor FOXM1 was first linked with cancer in 2002 [59] and has subsequently been shown to be involved in cancer initiation [13], progression [60] and prognosis [10] in diverse tissue types. FOXM1 is a known regulator of cell proliferation and mitotic spindle assembly genes but has also been linked with regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metastasis and more recently with induction of DNA methylation [61]., In this study we focus on the role of FOXM1 in breast cancer with the aim of mapping global FOXM1 binding sites in both ER-positive and -negative cancer cell lines and relating this to biological function. We show that FOXM1 binding occurs in the promoter regions of many cell cycle-related genes and also genes known to regulate mitotic spindle assembly; BUB1, ASPM, MAD2L1 and members of the kinesin family. We also confirmed binding in target genes such as CAV1 [62] and MMP family members; MMP2 and 8, VEGF and FGF linking with the role of FOXM1 in metastasis., The high degree of overlap between FOXM1 binding and ERα binding in MCF7 is of significant interest as previous studies have shown co-regulation of these factors [21, 22] and importantly that FOXM1 expression is essential for ERα-induced proliferation. We show that FOXM1 and ERα bind to the chromatin at the same place at the same time; however, the presence of FOXM1 at ERα co-bound chromatin sites is not required for ERα recruitment but is necessary for the loading of other cofactors to the ER transcriptional complex, such as CARM1. CARM1 is known to activate transcription by methylating histone H3 arginine residues [63] and constitutes a key part of nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional complexes acting in conjunction with other coactivators, such as CBP/p300, SRC-2 and GRIP1 [33, 64]. FOXM1 has previously been shown to interact directly with CARM1 binding factors such as p300/CBP [65] but, to our knowledge, this is the first time that a direct interaction has been shown between FOXM1 and CARM1., The differences in FOXM1 binding with ERα status in breast cancer cells contribute another dimension to the already complex mechanisms known to regulate FOXM1 transactivation. FOXM1 activity is regulated by multiple protein-protein interactions; during the cell cycle the temporal control required for precise G2/M transition is regulated both by phosphorylation steps involving different Cyclin/Cdks [66–68] and by inhibition by B55a, a subunit of protein phosphatase 2A [69]. Transcriptional activity is modulated by recruitment of coactivators and interaction with other transcription factors [70]. The data from our study suggest another mode of interaction of FOXM1, in this case co-binding with ERα in ERα-positive breast cancer cells., A similar role for FOXM1 in transcriptional regulation by recruitment of co-factors at specific genomic locations was proposed in a recent study by Carr et al. [71]. They showed that FOXM1 represses GATA-3 expression in the mammary gland by recruiting the methyltransferase DNMT3b to binding sites within the GATA-3 promoter, thereby leading to methylation-induced gene silencing., Inhibition of FOXM1 binding in MCF7 cells using thiostrepton confirmed the importance of this transcription factor in the regulation of ERα signaling pathways. Analysis of the regions where binding was significantly reduced showed that these were cis-regulatory regions involved in ERα pathways and indeed the gene expression changes confirmed that ERα signaling pathways were affected. Somewhat surprisingly, FOXM1 binding was increased at a number of genomic sites following thiostrepton treatment; however, these sites did not contain consensus FKH binding motifs and may represent a redistribution of FOXM1 in a similar manner to that described for the androgen receptor following FOXA1 depletion [72]. In the absence of FOXA1, androgen receptor binding was delocalized around the genome, generating, in addition to FOXA1 dependent-sites, both a subset of FOXA1-inhibited sites and a subset of FOXA1-independent binding sites where androgen receptor recruitment may occur via the presence of transcription factors other than FOXA1 with pioneer activity. Furthermore, a recent publication showed that FOXM1 has an atypical DNA binding mechanism [31], with binding at some genomic sites occurring via recruitment and binding to the MMB transcriptional activator complex. This mechanism not only explains how binding is increased at certain sites after inhibition of direct DNA binding but also fits with the binding pattern we observed in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to MCF7 cells, where the FKH motif was poorly enriched compared to other motifs such as the ETS family members. In fact we cannot rule out that some of the enriched FKH consensus sites in MCF7 cells actually represent FOXA1 binding motifs with FOXM1 tethered via other transcriptional co-factors. Thus, FOXM1, as a key regulator of the cell cycle, may show cell line-dependent patterns of DNA binding due to recruitment by different transcriptional complexes responsible for driving the proliferation in a particular cellular context., As FOXM1 expression has previously been correlated with prognosis in breast cancer we used our dataset to identify a novel FOXM1-regulated gene set significantly correlated with ER-positive breast cancer prognosis and drug resistance, thus confirming previous studies showing that FOXM1 over-expression is associated with resistance to drug treatment [19, 21]. This gene-signature of 38 FOXM1-regulated genes down-regulated by thiostrepton treatment was predictive of prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer patient datasets. Within this set are many well described FOXM1 target genes, such as those involved in mitotic spindle formation; however, there are a number of interesting novel FOXM1 target genes, such as ABCC5, a transporter protein associated with multi-drug resistance that may provide useful insights for future studies into the role of FOXM1 in breast cancer., We have demonstrated that FOXM1 shows distinct patterns of binding depending on ERα status in breast cancer cells, but within an ER-positive context FOXM1 plays an important role in ERα signaling pathways. Specifically, FOXM1 regulates a gene signature that correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, supporting the therapeutic potential in targeting FOXM1 in ER-positive breast cancer."

Chromatin association by LIN-35, the C. elegans ortholog of Rb, is impaired in the germline but robust in the soma, a characteristic that might govern differential effects on gene expression in the two cell types. In the intestine, LIN-35 and the heterochromatin protein HPL-2, the ortholog of Hp1, coordinately bind at many sites lacking E2F. Finally, selected direct target genes contribute to the soma-to-germline transformation of lin-35 mutants, including mes-4, a soma-specific target that promotes H3K36 methylation, and csr-1, a germline-specific target that functions in a 22G small RNA pathway., In sum, identification of tissue-specific binding profiles and effector target genes reveals important insights into the mechanisms by which Rb/E2F controls distinct cell fates in vivo.","","The Rb/E2F transcriptional complex is a major regulator of developmental and cellular fates. Underscoring its importance, the pocket protein Rb acts as a key tumor suppressor protein in cancers of diverse tissue origin (reviewed in [1]). Rb acts in large part by regulating the activity of E2F, a heterodimeric sequence-specific DNA binding factor composed of an E2F and DP subunit. In mammals, these factors are members of gene families: there are at least eight E2F-related factors, three DP-related factors, and three pocket proteins. These family members exhibit considerable redundancy and compensation. Moreover, a particular family member can either promote or inhibit tumorigenesis in a cell type-dependent manner (reviewed in [2]). This complexity has greatly hampered a mechanistic understanding of how the Rb/E2F pathway acts in vivo. To date, the only genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses of mammalian Rb/E2F have been performed in tissue culture, often in transformed cell lines (for example, [3, 4]). While valuable, the resulting global DNA binding profiles of Rb and E2F can be correlated only indirectly with tissue-specific phenotypes and ultimately with tumorigenesis., The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides an excellent system in which to directly investigate the function of Rb/E2F in vivo. Relative to mammals, its Rb/E2F pathway is very streamlined, with only one Rb-like pocket protein (LIN-35), one DP-like protein (DPL-1), and three E2F-related proteins, of which EFL-1 exerts the broadest effects in the animal [5, 6]. As in mammals, these factors are broadly expressed and play diverse roles in different tissues. They are part of a gene regulatory pathway known as SynMuv B that mediates differentiation of various somatic tissues, including the vulva, intestine, and pharynx (reviewed in [7]). A recent report used genetic, biochemical and gene expression data to place members of the SynMuv B pathway into three functionally distinct 'complexes', the DRM, heterochromatin, and Mec/Sumo complexes [8]. These three complexes contribute differentially to various SynMuv B phenotypes, potentially by selectively regulating subsets of target genes. LIN-35, EFL-1 and DPL-1 are members of the DRM complex., A major function of the SynMuv B pathway is to prevent somatic tissues from adopting characteristics of the germline fate, such as ectopic expression of germline genes, enhanced response to RNA interference (RNAi), and increased transgene silencing [9]. This soma-to-germline transformation is also associated with disrupted intestinal function and larval arrest at high temperatures [10]. Intriguingly, certain members of both DRM and heterochromatin complexes, such as lin-35 and hpl-2, respectively, are required for the high temperature arrest, while other members of the two complexes, such as efl-1 and lin-61, are not [10], suggesting tissue-specific formation of the SynMuv B complexes, Additionally, components of the SynMuv B pathway act differently in the germline compared to somatic tissues. For instance, in lin-35 mutants, germ cells exhibit impaired proliferation but can still undergo gametogenesis and fertilization; as a consequence mutants are fertile but have decreased brood size. By contrast, efl-1 and dpl-1 mutants display severe defects in oogenesis, ovulation, and fertilization, and are sterile [5, 11]. All of these data indicate that LIN-35, EFL-1 and DPL-1 control a fundamental developmental choice between 'immortal' germline and differentiated soma. However, an understanding of the tissue-specific relationships between these proteins and their targets remains unclear. In particular, it is essential to determine whether these proteins directly influence many target genes or a few master regulators to determine these fates. To understand mechanistically how LIN-35, EFL-1 and DPL-1 mediate their diverse effects in different contexts, we have chosen to identify the target sites for these factors in multiple tissue types., Genome-wide analysis of transcription factor binding in C. elegans has so far only been carried out using whole animals as the source material [12–14]. In particular, one recent study identified binding sites for another DRM component, LIN-54, in whole animals with all developmental stages combined [15]. While providing insight into the organismal function of the SynMuv pathway, this and other studies to date have masked cell type-specific binding events for broadly expressed factors with diverse functions, such as Rb/E2F., To address this limitation, we selectively expressed epitope-tagged LIN-35, EFL-1, and DPL-1 in the germline, intestine, and throughout the soma. We also expressed the SynMuvB heterochromatin complex protein HPL-2 (HP1-like) in the intestine. With these strains, we profiled chromatin interactions genome-wide and identified binding sites for each factor in each tissue that define sets of tissue-specific target genes with distinct properties and functions. Strikingly, most EFL-1/DPL-1 binding sites in the germline exhibit little to no LIN-35 binding, and LIN-35 binding is impaired overall in the germline relative to the soma. Conversely, in the intestine, LIN-35 binding is robust, and a subset of sites co-bound by HPL-2 but not EFL-1/DPL-1 exhibit unique properties. Our data suggest that LIN-35/EFL-1/DPL-1 most likely inhibits the germline fate in somatic tissues by directly acting on a few key targets rather than on many hundreds of individual genes. In sum, these tissue-specific binding profiles lead to insights into tissue-specific properties of Rb/E2F function., The Retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor pathway is inactivated in tumors of diverse tissue origins at a very high frequency. Although intensively studied, the actual mechanisms by which the Rb pathway directs proliferation and differentiation within the tissue-specific restrictions imposed in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we address this limitation by developing a system in C. elegans to globally identify the tissue-specific chromatin interactions of the core members of this pathway, LIN-35/Rb, EFL-1/E2F, and DPL-1/DP. A key advantage of this approach is that we were able to compare binding profiles between tissues to separate broadly bound sites from those present in individual tissues, thus focusing on the most biologically relevant binding events. This analysis revealed distinct sets of binding sites, with different candidate gene targets and modes of regulation in specific tissues. In a whole animal analysis, the sheer number of broadly bound sites relative to tissue-specific sites would have obscured the distinct functions of the Rb/E2F complex in the different tissues. Many of the broadly bound sites correspond to gene targets related to the best known mammalian E2F targets, such as cell cycle genes. Thus, our results suggest that many in vivo targets and much of the tissue-specific regulation by the Rb/E2F complex still remains to be discovered in mammalian systems., We present the first in depth examination of tissue-specific binding by the Rb/E2F regulatory pathway in vivo. These data highlight unique and sometimes unexpected properties of this pathway in different tissues, and clearly demonstrate that Rb/E2F have specialized roles in both progenitor and differentiated cell types. Future studies should be directed toward investigating many of the individual gene regulatory events that could play key roles in mediating the tissue-specific phenotypes of this intriguing master regulator."

EBV-mediated transformation of resting B cells to proliferating lymphoblastoid cells occurs in early stages of infection and is an excellent model for investigating the mechanisms associated with acquisition of unlimited growth., We investigated the effects of experimental EBV infection of B cells on DNA methylation profiles by using high-throughput analysis. Remarkably, we observed hypomethylation of around 250 genes, but no hypermethylation. Hypomethylation did not occur at repetitive sequences, consistent with the absence of genomic instability in lymphoproliferative cells. Changes in methylation only occurred after cell divisions started, without the participation of the active demethylation machinery, and were concomitant with acquisition by B cells of the ability to proliferate. Gene Ontology analysis, expression profiling, and high-throughput analysis of the presence of transcription factor binding motifs and occupancy revealed that most genes undergoing hypomethylation are active and display the presence of NF-κB p65 and other B cell-specific transcription factors. Promoter hypomethylation was associated with upregulation of genes relevant for the phenotype of proliferating lymphoblasts. Interestingly, pharmacologically induced demethylation increased the efficiency of transformation of resting B cells to lymphoblastoid cells, consistent with productive cooperation between hypomethylation and lymphocyte proliferation., Our data provide novel clues on the role of the B cell transcription program leading to DNA methylation changes, which we find to be key to the EBV-associated conversion of resting B cells to proliferating lymphoblasts.","","Infection of B cells with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is highly prevalent in humans, is an excellent model to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with the acquisition of unlimited growth during disease. EBV-associated changes in B cells are relevant to the development and progression of lymphomas [1] and lymphoproliferative disorders in immune-suppressed individuals, and various autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis [2]. In early primary human infection, EBV infects peripheral resting B cells and expresses six nuclear (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C and -LP) and two latent membrane proteins and small non-coding RNAs. This type of infection, in which these two groups of proteins transform resting B lymphocytes into continuously proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, is referred to as type III latency [1, 3]. This process mimics antigen-induced clonal expansion of resting B cells associated with MYC-mediated proliferation and upregulation of NF-κB, MAP kinases and antiapoptotic factors. Recent data have shown that EBNA2, which is essential to this process, enhances and exploits the B cell transcription program by binding to a variety of B cell transcription factor sites to achieve transformation [4]. In vivo, the vigorous cellular immune response directed against EBV-immortalized cells limits the proliferation and expansion of such latently infected cells at early stages of infection of a naïve host or in immunocompromised individuals. Studying type III latency lymphoblastoid cells is relevant because it not only allows the investigation of early steps in infection and the effects that the viral activity exerts on B cell function, but also is an excellent strategy for investigating changes related to the triggering of unlimited proliferation of B cells, before any additional secondary transforming genetic and epigenetic events occur., The mechanisms by which B cell identity is altered in this process towards unlimited proliferation, triggered by EBV infection, involve the acquisition of epigenetic changes. In this context, DNA methylation might play a key role, since this epigenetic mark participates in regulating transcriptional activity [5] and is known to be highly aberrant in several types of EBV-associated lymphomas [6, 7] and autoimmune diseases [8]. Despite its role in gene control, DNA methylation is not only a mechanism of transcriptional control but also guarantees genomic stability. The relationship between methylation and transcriptional activity has been best studied in promoter regions, particularly CpG island-associated promoters, where methylation is generally associated with transcriptional repression. In the context of the hematopoietic system, DNA methylation profiling has revealed overall higher methylation levels in the lymphoid branch relative to the myeloid one, and with respect to less differentiated progenitors [9]., A number of studies have addressed the analysis of DNA methylation changes associated with EBV infection of B cells. Several of these have revealed that whereas the EBV genomic sequence is virtually unmethylated in free viral particles and lymphoblastoid cells, the genome is heavily methylated in both Burkitt and Hodgkin lymphomas [10]. Also, the DNA methylation status of EBV promoters has been widely studied in association with the activity of latency promoters [11–14]. By contrast, fewer studies have addressed the acquisition of DNA methylation changes by the host cell during EBV-mediated transformation between resting B cells and proliferating lymphoblasts. EBV influences changes in the DNA methylation status at specific sequences [15–17] and these are likely to influence or modify the B cell phenotype and function. It is therefore of inherent interest to investigate the extent and mechanisms of acquisition of changes in DNA methylation by B cells following EBV infection as well as their potential contribution to phenotypic changes during this process., In this study we investigated the acquisition of DNA methylation changes during EBV-mediated transformation of resting B cells to lymphoblastoid cell lines by using methylation bead arrays. We exclusively observed significant hypomethylation of around 250 genes. No hypermethylation was found. Time course analysis indicated that hypomethylation occurs only when cell proliferation has started, suggesting the exclusive participation of replication-dependent mechanisms. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, comparison with the expression patterns of different cell types and between resting B cells and proliferating lymphoblasts, high-throughput analysis of the presence of transcription factor binding motifs and occupancy revealed that most genes undergoing hypomethylation are active and display the presence of NF-κB p65 and other B cell-specific transcription factors. In addition, hypomethylation associates with upregulation of several genes that are essential in the transformation of resting B cells to continuously proliferating lymphoblasts. Pharmacologically induced DNA demethylation increases B cell transformation efficiency. Our data provide novel clues to the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms associated with EBV-associated conversion of resting B cells to proliferating lymphoblasts, the relevance of the cell type context and why DNA hypomethylation could be key in the efficiency of this process., Our results provide evidence that EBV-mediated transformation of RBLs to LCLs results in the demethylation of a cluster of around 250 genes. Conversely, no significant hypermethylation is observed. Hypomethylation has been described in various immune disease-related contexts, including ICF (immunodeficiency, centromere instability and facial anomalies) syndrome [41] and autoimmune diseases [8]. In most cases, disease-associated hypomethylation occurs at repetitive sequences, including Alu elements [42]. However, in RBL to LCL transformation, hypomethylation takes place near the transcription start sites of around 250 genes, and no apparent hypomethylation occurs at the major type of repetitive elements. Lack of hypomethylation in repetitive sequences is consistent with the minimal changes in genomic stability associated with EBV-associated lymphoproliferation., Given that hypomethylation occurs in association with the acquisition of proliferation, it is likely to be related to the decreased efficiency in DNA methylation maintenance as cells start to divide. The lack of evidence for active demethylation mechanisms during this process also supports the above possibility. The transition of a differentiated resting cell to a proliferative status would require the participation of DNMTs to maintain the DNA methylation profiles throughout replication/division cycles. Various lines of evidence indicate that DNMTs are associated with repetitive sequences [33, 34] and that heterochromatic regions act as a reservoir for DNMTs [33]. This would explain why active regions, which are less rich in DNMTs, lose methylation in the transformation from resting to proliferative B cells, whereas in ICF syndrome, which is characterized by mutations in DNMT3B, hypomethylation takes place in heterochromatic regions, which act as reservoirs of DNMTs., In fact, analysis of the regions associated with hypomethylation during RBL to LCL transformation shows enrichment of highly expressed genes and target sites of transcription factors that are expressed in B cells or are specifically activated during EBV infection, such as factors in the NF-κB pathway [26, 43]. The modulation of the NF-κB signaling by EBV is not only important for viral infection, but also contributes to the development of malignant neoplasia [43]. In addition, our results indicate that hypomethylated genes are regulated by B cell-specific factors like EBF1, IRF4 and MEF2C, the last two of which are implicated in B cell activation and proliferation processes. We also observed that many of the genes that undergo hypomethylation, like CD19, CD79a, BLNK, BLK and LCK, are highly expressed in B cells. This suggests that active regions are either more accessible to putative demethylating machinery or are less efficient at maintaining methylation as proliferation starts. Given the lack of demethylation events before proliferation begins, and that we were unable to detect links between any of the proposed mechanisms associated with active demethylation, we favor the occurrence of a replication-coupled mechanism of demethylation, due to the inefficient maintenance of DNA methylation as replication is initiated. Similar to studies of the EBNA2 binding sites [4] in which EBV exploits intrinsic B cell transcription programs, hypomethylation takes place preferentially in genes that are expressed. Comparison of the lists of significantly hypomethylated genes and the presence of transcription factor binding motifs and occupancy reinforced this notion. Data from different sources suggest that transcriptionally active regions are devoid of DNMTs, making the maintenance of DNA methylation less efficient. On the other hand, since the main functional consequence of promoter hypomethylation would potentially be an increase in transcription, it is likely that demethylation contributes to overexpression of some of these genes. In this sense, we have identified several key genes that undergo both hypomethylation and overexpression during the conversion of RBLs to LCLs. These include genes like EBI3 [37, 38], a subunit of the cytokine IL27, LTA [39] and members of the SLAM family [40] among others that are known to contribute to lymphocyte proliferation (Additional file 4)., In addition, demethylation of genes that already have high expression levels in the first set of infected cells might also lock its transcriptional status, and therefore would reinforce the B cell phenotype, and might be key to enable infection of more B cells. EBV initially infects oropharynx epithelial cells, establishing a lytic replication that spreads to some B cells in nearby lymphoid tissues. Those expand as EBV establishes a type III latency growth-transforming infection of B cells that elicit a strong T-cell-specific response. Maintaining a B cell phenotype would favor recirculation and generalized expansion to B cell areas in secondary lymphoid organs where surviving B cells downregulate EBV antigen expression and establish long-term silent latency [44]., The functional relevance of demethylation in this process is highlighted by the observation that treatment of RBLs with azadC at low sub-toxic concentrations enhances RBL to LCL transformation. Since the EBV genome is virtually unmethylated in free viral particles, demethylation at EBV promoters and overexpression of EBV-encoded genes can be ruled out as responsible for more efficient transformation of RBLs to LCLs. Our findings on the enhanced cell proliferation concomitantly associated with the presence of low sub-toxic amounts of azadC suggests that initial DNA methylation changes may cooperate in the efficiency of this process., Although type III latency lymphoblastoid cells do not necessarily correspond to initial steps of lymphomagenesis, they both share enhanced proliferation [45]. It is likely that hypomethylation occurs in early steps towards to lymphomagenesis, when enhanced proliferation starts. In other hematological neoplasias, like in acute myeoloid leukemia, DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent [46], and it has been proposed that these mutations in an enzyme responsible for the establishment of DNA methylation are an early event of clonal evolution [47]. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, increased levels of TCL1 result in inhibition of DNA methylation [48]. Inhibition of methylation is proposed to be a common oncogenic mechanism in leukemogenesis [48]. These findings highlight the relevance of our study as a potential early mechanism in this group of tumors., Our study of DNA methylation changes in EBV-mediated transformation of RBLs to LCLs reveals that only promoter hypomethylation occurs during this process. Neither significant hypermethylation nor methylation changes at repetitive elements are observed. Hypomethylation takes place only when proliferation has started, and the analysis of putative elements of the active demethylation machinery does not indicate their implication during this process. Most genes undergoing hypomethylation are active and display the presence of NF-κB p65 and other B-cell-specific transcription factors. Since DNMTs tend to associate with heterochromatic regions, it is likely that maintenance of DNA methylation is less efficient in transcriptionally active regions as cells start to proliferate triggered by EBV; however, this process does not occur during CD40L/IL4-stimulation of B cells where no changes are observed. Our results show that hypomethylation is associated with further upregulation of gene expression of many of these genes. Also, pharmacologically induced demethylation increases B cell transformation efficiency and proliferation. Collectively, our data indicate that the B cell transcription machinery is associated with the subset of genes that undergo hypomethylation. The finding that relevant genes in EBV-mediated transformation of B cells are further upregulated indicates a key role of this mechanism. Hypomethylation has been proposed to play a role in early stages of hematological malignancies, including other B cell malignancies. Our data reinforce the notion of the role of hypomethylation in early lymphomagenesis and shed light on underlying mechanisms., Methylation array data for this publication have been deposited in NCBI's GEO and is accessible through GEO series accession number GSE41957 [59]."

MetAMOS represents an important step towards fully automated metagenomic analysis, starting with next-generation sequencing reads and producing genomic scaffolds, open-reading frames and taxonomic or functional annotations. MetAMOS can aid in reducing assembly errors, commonly encountered when assembling metagenomic samples, and improves taxonomic assignment accuracy while also reducing computational cost. MetAMOS can be downloaded from: https://​github.​com/​treangen/​MetAMOS., Metagenomics has opened the door for unprecedented studies of microbial communities sampled from the environment (for example, ocean surveys [1–3], Antarctic expeditions [4], and even health-care facilities [5]), as well as from living organisms [6] and the human body [7–11]. These studies have been made possible by dramatic recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, the same technologies that have revolutionized the study of individual genomes, such as recent efforts to reconstruct the genomes of thousands of humans [12]. While sequencing technologies have been rapidly improving, the computational infrastructure needed to analyze the resulting data has been slow to adapt to the volume and characteristics of the data being generated. In particular, genome assembly, though substantially improved in recent years [13], remains an important challenge even for single organisms. In metagenomic projects, traditional genome assemblers have trouble disentangling closely related strains and distinguishing true polymorphisms from sequencing errors. As a result, many researchers forgo assembly and instead focus their analyses directly on the underlying reads [14–22]. While these methods have shown promise, analysis tasks such as gene finding and taxonomic classification become much easier when applied to genomic contigs reconstructed through assembly. Accordingly, a number of computational tools specifically targeted at metagenomic de novo assembly have begun to emerge [23–26]. These tools are, however, still in their infancy and their application is limited by a number of factors such as: (i) performance issues when applied to large metagenomic datasets; (ii) the need for careful parameter tuning in order to optimize assembly results; and (iii) the lack of integration with the other components of metagenomic analysis pipelines. Furthermore, the relative benefits and drawbacks of individual assembly tools are difficult to ascertain given the lack of metagenomic reference datasets, and the widely divergent data characteristics of current metagenomic projects., It is also important to stress that assembly is just one of many other bioinformatics analyses typically performed in metagenomic projects, including taxonomic classification, gene annotation, variant analysis, and so on. Performing these tasks requires the installation, integration, and tuning of multiple software packages, which is not trivial even for groups with extensive bioinformatics expertise. As a result, most studies rely on ad hoc pipelines based on custom scripts and intensive manual analyses, making it difficult to reproduce or extend analysis results and hampering collaboration., To address these challenges, we developed MetAMOS, a modular and customizable framework for metagenomic assembly and analysis. To researchers without bioinformatics expertise, MetAMOS provides a push-button solution for analysis of metagenomic datasets, irrespective of the sequencing technology used. In addition to the actual assembly, MetAMOS outputs a taxonomic profile of the community, gene predictions, and potential genomic variants. In some sense, MetAMOS can be viewed as an assembly-centric counterpart to QIIME [27] and mothur [28], popular pipelines used for the analysis 16S rRNA data. To bioinformaticians, MetAMOS provides a modular and flexible pipeline, integrating many metagenomic analysis tools that can be tailored and extended to meet specific analysis needs., The MetAMOS package is built around a collection of publicly available assembly and analysis tools tied together with the help of the lightweight workflow system Ruffus [29]. The current analysis workflow and available software packages are outlined in Figure 1, and discussed in detail below in the Workflow section. It is important to stress, however, that these tools are not simply strung together into ad hoc pipelines; rather, the entire pipeline is built around the unique features provided by the metagenomic scaffolder Bambus 2 [30].

                        MetAMOS workflow. The arrows indicate dependence between pipeline steps. MetAMOS leverages over 20 existing analysis tools for various steps in the pipeline. The figure also highlights the novel contributions to metagenomic analysis made by MetAMOS.

                    , The pipeline can be broadly separated into three main sections. The first includes a pre-processing step aimed at constructing a collection of conservative contigs using software specific to the sequencing technology employed (Sanger, 454, and Illumina data are currently supported). Specifically, pre-processing involves the following steps: (1) dynamic library size re-estimation based on read mappings, and (2) contig cleaning (removal of contigs that lack read mappings). In the second step, Bambus 2 is used to identify genomic repeats, scaffold the initial set of contigs, correct assembly errors, extend contigs, and detect genomic variants. In a third, post-scaffolding stage, the contigs are further analyzed and annotated using scaffold-aware approaches, such as the propagation of taxonomic labels to all contigs linked together within a scaffold. Thus, the scaffold information generated by Bambus 2 allows us to integrate multiple sources of information and obtain more accurate annotations of the resulting assembly. At the end of the final stage, MetAMOS produces an interactive HTML report that summarizes the main results of the run (Figure 2).

                        MetAMOS HTML report interface. The majority of results generated during the pipeline are exposed to the user via an interactive HTML report. From left to right. Pipeline status: this lists the state (OK, FAIL, SKIP) for each step in the pipeline. In addition, each individual step is linked to an image/text summary of the results generated during this step. Krona plot: by default, in the main section of the report an interactive Krona plot of the annotations is displayed. This main section is dynamically updated with content from the other steps at the user's request. Single/Multiple Sample plots: This section is dedicated to displaying automatically generated R plots of assembly statistics. If multiple samples are available, they can be combined into a single plot. Quick summary: this column, as the name implies, provides a very brief overview of the results (listing in descending order number of reads, contigs, scaffolds, ORFs, variants) in addition to linking to a file containing a summary of all of the executed commands for the MetAMOS run.
                    , Our package shares similarities with SmashCommunity [31], a metagenomic analysis pipeline targeted at 454 and Sanger data. Unlike MetAMOS, SmashCommunity only supports a small set of assembly and analysis tools (Arachne [32], Celera Assembler [33, 34], Forge, and MetaGeneMark [35]). More importantly, however, SmashCommunity simply links together the individual analysis tools and does not provide additional functionality made possible by the integration of different analyses. For these reasons, instead of building upon SmashCommunity, we decided to build MetAMOS around the AMOS open-source genome assembly framework, which already included many assembly-centric analysis utilities [30, 36–41]., Below we demonstrate the use of MetAMOS and compare its performance to other software tools that can and have been used for metagenomic analysis. We focus our analysis on several datasets with complementary characteristics: 'mock' metagenomic communities from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) [11], and real metagenomic samples from the HMP and the Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHIT) [42] projects. The mock communities (described in more detail below) comprise a known mixture of organisms and provide a valuable resource for assessing the accuracy of different assembly tools. The real datasets are a sample of data from recent studies and demonstrate the practical potential of our tool., The goal of MetAMOS is to provide an integrated environment for metagenomic assembly and analysis, relying on both existing and novel algorithms and software tools. Results on both 'mock' communities with known sequence composition and real metagenomic data demonstrate that MetAMOS can generate accurate and contiguous assemblies of metagenomic datasets and improve the quality of initial assemblies constructed either with conservative assemblers developed for single genomes (for example, Velvet), or with assemblers specifically targeted at metagenomic data (for example, MetaVelvet)., Overall, our results indicate that the choice of assembler has a strong influence on the final assembly results and choosing the ideal assembler requires taking into account both contiguity and correctness. More aggressive assembly approaches sometimes result in more contiguous assemblies, but often introduce errors of the most severe kind (chimeras). The level of improvement provided by MetAMOS over other assembly tools is highly dependent on the specific characteristics of the dataset being assembled. MetAMOS only provided a small improvement over other tools (particularly SOAPdenovo and MetaIDBA) in the HMP mock communities; however, in the HMP tongue dorsum dataset the improvement was more pronounced. This result can be explained in part by the library size re-estimation automatically performed within the MetAMOS preprocessing stage (the library size reported in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) was correct for the mock community but incorrect for the tongue dorsum), as well as by the ability of MetAMOS (through the use of Bambus 2) to effectively build scaffolds across regions of genomic variation. Such regions were substantially more abundant in the real dataset (approximately 10,000) compared to the artificial communities (approximately 300)., Thus, given a novel metagenomic dataset with unknown taxonomic composition, it can be difficult to choose an appropriate assembler a priori. This motivates our focus on fast end-to-end analysis and inclusion of multiple assembly methods, allowing the user to tailor the pipeline to their data. The modular design of MetAMOS enables its adaptation to new types of data by simply incorporating genome assembly tools tuned to the specific features of the new data., In addition to assembly, MetAMOS provides several features important for downstream analysis, including taxonomic profiling, gene detection, and identification of genomic variation motifs. We have shown that the combination of these analyses within a single pipeline can produce improved results. We have demonstrated this for taxonomic classification, where analysis within MetAMOS increases the number of correctly classified sequences by as much as four-fold while reducing error. Another benefit is a two- to three-fold speed up within MetAMOS versus the taxonomic annotation methods run on the reads (Table 2). MetAMOS makes it straightforward to assess the performance of the various tools for each of these steps for a given sample. We continue to work on improving the performance of MetAMOS and plan to add additional analysis modules in future releases, including integration with pipelines for metabolic profiling (such as HUMAnN [61])., Finally, the modular design and open-source licensing model enable researchers to adapt MetAMOS to new applications beyond our initial focus on metagenomic data. As an example, the combination of Velvet-SC (a single-cell assembler already integrated within MetAMOS) and the coverage-independent repeat detection methods of Bambus 2 make MetAMOS an effective pipeline for single-cell genomics. In addition to our primary goal of providing biologists with an integrated analysis pipeline for metagenomic data, we hope that the availability of MetAMOS will encourage researchers to contribute their own analysis modules, and that this framework will reduce duplication of efforts and accelerate developments in this field by allowing scientists to focus their attention on individual components without having to re-implement all the components of a metagenomic pipeline., MetAMOS was designed to be run in two modes: 'Assembly mode', which requires larger amounts of RAM and starts from raw read data; or 'Analysis mode', which starts from already assembled contigs/scaffolds and can be run on much more modest computational nodes or servers. MetAMOS has support for eight assemblers (SOAPdenovo [51], Newbler, Velvet [62, 63], Velvet-SC [64], MetaVelvet [24], Meta-IDBA [25], CABOG [33] and Minimus [40]); six read/contig annotation methods (PhyloSift [65], BLAST [66], FCP [22, 67], PHMMER [68], PhymmBL [14, 15]); three metagenomic gene prediction tools (FragGeneScan [69], MetaGeneMark [35], Glimmer-MG [70]); one abundance estimation method (MetaPhyler [52]); a BLAST-based [66] functional annotation step using the Uniprot database [71]; a scaffolder engineered specifically for metagenomic data (Bambus 2 [30]); and an interactive tool for visualizing taxonomic and functional composition (Krona [46]) (Figure 1)., MetAMOS is available from [78]. MetAMOS and AMOS-specific code are released open source under the Perl Artistic License [98]. Licensing restrictions for bundled software are outlined on the main project page. Operating systems are Mac OS X and most UNIX systems and programming languages are Perl, Python, Java, C++."

Previous studies mainly focused on a single body habitat from a limited set of subjects. Here, we analyzed one of the largest microbiome datasets to date and generated a biogeographical map that annotates the biodiversity, spatial relationships, and temporal stability of 22 habitats from 279 healthy humans., We identified 929 genera from more than 24 million 16S rRNA gene sequences of 22 habitats, and we provide a baseline of inter-subject variation for healthy adults. The oral habitat has the most stable microbiota with the highest alpha diversity, while the skin and vaginal microbiota are less stable and show lower alpha diversity. The level of biodiversity in one habitat is independent of the biodiversity of other habitats in the same individual. The abundances of a given genus at a body site in which it dominates do not correlate with the abundances at body sites where it is not dominant. Additionally, we observed the human microbiota exhibit both cosmopolitan and endemic features. Finally, comparing datasets of different projects revealed a project-based clustering pattern, emphasizing the significance of standardization of metagenomic studies., The data presented here extend the definition of the human microbiome by providing a more complete and accurate picture of human microbiome biogeography, addressing questions best answered by a large dataset of subjects and body sites that are deeply sampled by sequencing.","Biogeography, Human microbiome, Biodiversity, Temporal stability","Biogeography in traditional ecology attempts to describe spatial and temporal patterns of biological diversity of organisms [1]. It seeks to answer what organisms are present, how they are distributed, and how they vary over time. Biogeographical patterns allow one to explore what ecological rules apply, such as cosmopolitan (global) or endemic (confined to a location) distribution patterns of taxa., The human body is composed of many niches that are directly or indirectly exposed to the external environment and are modulated by interaction with multiple systems such as the host immune, endocrine, and nervous systems. Each niche thus serves as a unique and complex space for microbes to survive and thrive. Alteration of the microbial balance in humans is associated with disease [2–12]. Characterization of the human microbial community by culture-independent, high-throughput sequencing unveiled the high diversity of microbes in different habitats of the body. The gut microbiome is the best-characterized human microbial habitat, and it was originally estimated to harbor 500 to 1,000 species [13]. Bacterial community structures in other habitats of the human body such as the oral, skin, nasal, and vaginal areas also have been addressed [14–21]. Over 500 species-level phylotypes were discovered in oral habitats [16, 22]. Two hundred and five genera were identified on the skin surface from 10 subjects [18]. Traditionally, urine has been thought to be sterile but culture-independent sequencing uncovered diverse microbial communities and substantial intra- and inter-subject variability [7]., High variation of microbial composition between individuals requires deeper sequencing and larger subject numbers to have a more complete view of human microbiome. The NIH launched the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) [23], aiming to more fully characterize the human microbiota and address its role in health and disease. This project enrolled 300 healthy, young adults, collected samples from 15 (male) or 18 (female) habitats in the body, and produced datasets of both 16S rRNA gene and whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences [24]. The 16S rRNA gene sequences aim to define community structures in different habitats, representing major niches of the human body, including stool, oral, skin, nasal, and vaginal areas. The HMP consortium has been conducting extensive analysis with the HMP 16s rRNA gene dataset to explore different aspects of human microbiome [24–29]. RDP-based taxonomic, operational taxonomic unit (OTU), and phylogenetic approaches are the main analytic methods used to characterize microbial community structure [24, 25, 28]. The RDP taxonomic approach used in this study possesses easy interpretability and better sequence error tolerance. It provides confident taxonomic assignment at the genus and other higher taxonomic levels. The OTU approach offers a sub-genus level resolution. However, the OTU does not always reflect a biological unit, and technical factors (single, average, complete linkage) largely affect the components within an OTU. The phylogenetic approach dependent on the tree construction provides phylogeny of the bacterial community, but it inevitably bears the intrinsic problems of tree construction using short reads. Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and they are complementary to each other. They provide equally important insight into the bacterial community structure [30]., As a companion paper of the HMP main papers, we presented an extensive taxonomic analysis of the majority of the HMP samples as well as additional samples comprising preterm baby stool, two urogenital sites, and the conjunctiva in adults, thus expanding the view of the microbiome beyond that of the HMP. We addressed the following aspects of human microbial biogeography in the context of a large cohort and deep sequencing: how many organisms inhabit the human body; is the biodiversity of one habitat influenced by other habitats; is the presence or abundance of the organism in one habitat affected by other habitats; what is the bacterial distribution pattern in a habitat; what is the degree of inter-personal variation and temporal variation in different habitats; are the HMP data comparable with the prior human microbiome studies. The analysis focusing on the above questions are not addressed in other HMP companion papers or are insufficiently investigated in the main papers. Answering these questions allows us to have a more complete and broad understanding of the ecosystems of the human body., Using the large 16s rRNA gene dataset generated by HMP and other projects, we analyzed the biogeographic patterns of human microbiota from 22 different habitats., The biodiversity by the 22 habitats representing the human body has implications in human microbial ecology. Each habitat has its own characteristic biodiversity and taxon abundance distribution curve. While there are many contributing factors to each characteristic pattern, this description of the healthy state will contribute to recognition of changes associated with disease. The trend of the biodiversity changes varies with diseases. For example, diversity was reduced in stool habitat with obesity [43], but increased in the vaginal habitat with vaginosis [46]. However, it is not clear whether the disturbed biodiversity is the consequence or the cause of disease. Moreover, compared to classical macro-ecological systems, where healthy ecosystems show high biodiversity, considered important for stability and surviving stress to the system, it is apparent that the situation with the human microbiome is more complex as there is no simple rule relating biodiversity to health. Thus for use of biodiversity as a diagnostic of health or disease, careful analysis of the baseline healthy state in each habitat is required., Despite the community variation with different habitats, the structures of these communities in human habitats adhere to general ecological rules. For example, most habitats have a few dominant taxa with a large number of individually rare species; the more abundant taxa show the most dispersal among subjects, although some minor taxa are widespread too; habitats showing lower Shannon diversity (vagina, skin) also are among the most variable. It was reported that the vaginal bacterial communities from healthy adults underwent drastic changes over a short period of time [21]. In this study, we also observed the dynamic community structure of the anterior nares. Clinical studies have revealed that the prevalence of pharyngeal colonization and respiratory tract infections caused by Moraxella catarrhalis displays seasonal variation and increases in winter [47]. Unfortunately, no detailed seasonal information is available for this dataset. Further study with multiple sampling points at different seasons will provide a better picture of the seasonal effect on the bacterial community in the anterior nares. In general, familiar concepts from macro-ecology appear to apply. Both cosmopolitan and endemic organisms are found in the human microbiome, with many organisms found in multiple habitats, albeit at varying abundance, so the adage 'everything is everywhere, but environment selects' [48] in ecology appears to hold for the human microbiome as well., Distinguishing rare organisms from noise is challenging. Although methods for denoising data to remove reads with sequencing errors is useful, even after quality filtering and chimera removal there are still artifacts to be addressed such as contamination. Tests based on increasing sequencing depth or prevalence in samples partially address artifacts but still leave aspects unresolved. It should be noted that the presence of Propinionbacterium and Corynebacterium in stool samples is uncertain for these reasons. More carefully designed controls for multiple sample processing steps are important for more definitive studies on rare organisms., The goal of defining the normal human bacterial biogeography is to be able to identify specific associations of altered bacterial biogeography with human disease. The high level inter-personal variation of bacterial communities has significant impact for study designs. Host genotype, effects due to viruses, sub-genus, and sub-species level genetic variation, functional equivalence of multiple taxa, and other biological effects all contribute to this variation and will need to be measured and/or controlled in studies seeking disease correlations. In addition, efforts are required to carefully select subjects to preclude bias and impose universal protocols of metagenomic sample preparation and sequencing, as exemplified by the HMP. Metagenomic DNA storage, preparation [45], sequencing, and analysis pipelines vary with different projects, which complicates the comparison between projects, as seen here in comparisons of HMP data with twin study data as well as with Chinese saliva data., Despite the scale of the dataset in terms of numbers of sequences, the total number of study subjects is still relatively small in epidemiological terms, albeit larger than most previous studies. Efforts to define the appropriate study design to obtain statistical power for conclusions as to effects at different taxonomic levels are underway but are not yet complete. Thus the observations reported here should be taken with this caveat in mind., Finally, we note that the approach presented here provides an organismal picture of 'who' comprises the human microbiome, potentially useful for recognizing deviations in disease. However, the 16S rRNA gene method involves PCR amplification with degenerate primers that may nevertheless favor some taxa over others. This method also creates chimeric sequences that are largely but not completely removed during data processing. With the decrease of sequencing cost, sequencing large cohorts of samples by WGS is feasible in the future. The taxonomic profiling derived from WGS data (that is, MetaPhlAn) will overcome the above concerns [49]. Furthermore, the taxonomic approach using either 16S rRNA gene or WGS sequences must be complemented by studies of the individual organisms to understand 'what' functional activities they are providing, necessary for a mechanistic understanding of the functioning of the microbiome. The pure focus on the organisms of many studies of the human microbiome leaves this analysis incomplete. As aptly stated by early researchers in the field 'It is what bacteria do rather than what they are that commands attention, since our interest centers in the host rather than the parasite' [50]., We comprehensively addressed the bacterial biogeography of multiple habitats from a cohort of 279 healthy subjects. What emerges is the beginning of a detailed picture of the character of each of these habitats with respect to aggregate ecological properties such as biodiversity as well as the specifics of their bacterial compositions. Each of these habitats was also analyzed with respect to variation between subjects, variation over time, and correlations between the habitats. While the biogeographic patterns of the human microbiome have been establishing, future investigations should turn the focus from observational study to hypothesis driven study. By testing the current and novel biogeographic theories, we will better understand the underlying mechanisms that govern the observed biogeographic patterns. This in turn will enable us to manipulate our microbiota in clinic for medical benefit."
